A HISTORY OF THE WORLD
FROM THE 20thTO THE 
21stCENTURY
With the onset of decolonisation, the rise and fall of fascism and communism, the technological revo-
lution and the rapidly increasing power of the US, the world since 1900 has witnessed global changeon an immense scale. Providing a comprehensive survey of the key events and personalities of this periodthroughout the world, A History of the World from the 20th to the 21st Century includes discussion oftopics such as:•the conﬂict in Europe, 1900–19
•the brutal world of the dictators, 1930s and 1940s
The partition of Bosnia, 1995923

Corbis.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSA history of our world over the past century ismore fascinating than ﬁction, ﬁlled with drama,
the unexpected overtaking events. The lives of
millions on every continent have been shaped bychanges that occurred. Our world is one ofvibrant cultures and different paths of develop-
ment, a world of gross inequalities, greater than
ever. But how is a world history to be written,
from what perspective? Inevitably this world
history has a Western perspective, but avoids thelofty generalisations of briefer accounts. Basicfacts – who has time for them? But without
sufﬁcient detail interpretations are imposed and
readers are in no position to form judgements of
their own. A longer account need not be read allat once, detail need not deaden but can provideinsights and bring history to life.Our world is closely interrelated. Today, theUS exceeds in power and wealth all other coun-
tries, its outreach is global. Economies and trade
are interlinked. Visual and audio communicationcan be sent from one part of the world to anotherin an instant. The Internet is virtually universal.
Mass travel by air and sea is commonplace. The
environment is also of global concern. Migration
has created multinational cultures. Does this notlead to the conclusion that a world history shouldbe written from a global perspective and that 
the nation state should no longer dominate? Is
world history a distinctive discipline? Stimulating
accounts have been based on this premise, as ifviewing history from outer space.Undeniably there are global issues, but claimsthat the age of the nation state is past are
premature and to ignore its influence in the
twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries obscures anunderstanding of the past and the present. TheUS does have the ability to intervene all over the
globe but here too limits of power apply; US
policy is based on its national interests as are the
policies of other nations. There is global cooper-
ation where it suits national interests but nothinglike world government. National interests alsocontribute to the gross inequalities of wealth
between different regions of the world, in the
twenty-ﬁrst century greater than ever.An end to history is not in sight either. It hasbeen argued that the conﬂict of ideology is pastand that ‘democracy’ and the ‘free enterprise
market economy’ have triumphed. But these are
labels capable of many interpretations. Further-
more, to base history on such a conclusion is
taking the Western perspective to extremes. Dif-ferent paths of development have dominated thepast and will not disappear in the future. That is
why this book still emphasises the importance of
nations interacting, of national histories and of the
distinctive cultural development of regions. Whileendeavouring not to ignore global issues, they aretherefore not seen as the primary cause of change,
of peace and war, wealth and poverty.The book is based on my reading over the pastthirty years, more works of scholarship than I canreasonably list and, for current affairs, on major1PREFACE
periodicals such as The Economist, Time, News-week, the daily press, broadcasts and a limitedamount of foreign news as well as the Internet.
But I have also derived immense beneﬁt from dis-
cussions with colleagues and students in Britain
and abroad. I cannot mention them all individu-ally and must make do here with a collectivethank you.But some people have helped so much that Iwould like to express my appreciation to them
individually – to my agent Bruce Hunter, of
David Highams, who oversees my relations withpublishers, to Victoria Peters of the Routledgepublishers Taylor & Francis, to Pauline Roberts,
my personal secretary, who now for many years
has encouraged me and turned with skill and
endless patience, hand-written pages into well-presented discs. Above all, to Patricia my wife,who has allowed me the space to write and
provided spiritual and physical sustenance.Technical note: First, some basic statistics areprovided of population, trade and industry in vari-ous countries for purposes of comparison. Theyare often taken for granted. Authorities frequently
disagree on these in detail; they should, therefore,
be regarded as indicative rather than absolutely
precise. A comparison of standards of living
between countries is not an exact science. I havegiven per-capita figures of the gross national product (GNP) as a very rough guide; but theserepresent only averages in societies where differen-tials of income may be great; furthermore, they 
are expressed in US dollars and so are dependent
on exchange rates; actual costs of living also vary
widely between countries; the per-capita GNPcannot, therefore, be simply translated into com-parative standards of living and provide but a
rough guide. The purchasing parity guide in US
dollars is an improvement but, again, can only be
viewed as indicative. Second, the transliteration
from Chinese to Roman lettering presents specialproblems. The Pinyin system of romanisation wasofﬁcially adopted by China on 1 January 1979 for
international use, replacing the Wade-Giles sys-
tem. Thus, where Wade-Giles had Mao Tse-tung
and Teng Hsaio-ping, Pinyin gives Mao Zedongand Deng Xiaoping. For clarity’s sake, the usage inthis book is not entirely consistent: the chosen
form is Pinyin, but Wade-Giles is kept for certain
older names where it is more easily recognisable,
for example Shanghai, Chiang Kaishek and theKuomintang. Peking changes to the Pinyin formBeijing after the communist takeover.The Institute for German Studies, The University of Birmingham, September 2004xiiPREFACE
Historical epochs do not coincide strictly withcenturies. The French Revolution in 1789, not
the year 1800, marked the beginning of a new
historical era. The beginning of the twentiethcentury, too, is better dated to 1871, when Ger-many became uniﬁed, or the 1890s, when inter-
national instability became manifest in Europe 
and Asia and a new era of imperial rivalry, which
the Germans called Weltpolitik, began. On theEuropean continent Germany had become by farthe most powerful military nation and was rapidlyadvancing industrially. In eastern Asia during 
the 1890s a modernised Japan waged its first 
successful war of aggression against China. In the
Americas the foundations were laid for the emer-gence of the US as a superpower later in thecentury. The US no longer felt secure in isola-
tion. Africa was finally partitioned between 
the European powers. These were some of the
portents indicating the great changes to come.
There were many more.Modernisation was creating new industrial andpolitical conﬂict and dividing society. The state
was becoming more centralised, its bureaucracy
grew and achieved control to an increasing degree
over the lives of the individual. Social tensionswere weakening the tsarist Russian Empire andduring the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century
Russia was defeated by Japan. The British Empire
was at bay and Britain was seeking support, not
certain which way to turn. Fierce nationalism, the build-up of vast armies and navies, andunquestioned patriotism that regarded war as anopportunity to prove manhood rather than as 
a catastrophe, characterised the mood as the new
century began. Boys played with their tin soldiersand adults dressed up in the ﬁnery of uniforms.The rat-infested mud of the trenches and machine
guns mowing down tens of thousands of young
men as yet lay beyond the imagination. Soldiering
was still glorious, chivalrous and glamorous. But
the early twentieth century also held the promiseof a better and more civilised life in the future.In the Western world civilisation was held toconsist not only of cultural achievements but also
of moral values. Despite all the rivalries of the
Western nations, wanton massacres of ethnicminorities, such as that of the Armenians by theTurks in the 1890s, aroused widespread revul-
sion and prompted great-power intervention. 
The pogroms in Russia and Romania against 
the Jews were condemned by civilised peoples,
including the Germans, who offered help andrefuge despite the growth of anti-Semitism athome. The Dreyfus affair outraged Queen
Victoria and prompted Émile Zola to mobilise 
a powerful protest movement in France; the
Captain’s accusers were regarded as representingthe corrupt elements of the Third Republic.Civilisation to contemporary observers seemed 
to be moving forward. Before 1914 there was no
good reason to doubt that history was the story
of mankind’s progress, especially that of the whiteEuropean branch.11PROLOGUETHE WORLD FROM THE 20thTO 
THE 21stCENTURY
There was a sense of cultural afﬁnity amongthe aristocracy and bourgeoisie of Europe.Governed by monarchs who were related to each
other and who tended to reign for long periods
or, in France, by presidents who changed too
frequently to be remembered for long, the well-to-do felt at home anywhere in Europe. Theupper reaches of society were cosmopolitan, dis-
porting themselves on the Riviera, in Paris and in
Dresden; they felt that they had much in common
and that they belonged to a superior civilisation.
Some progress was real. Increasingly, provisionwas made to help the majority of the people whowere poor, no doubt in part to cut the ground
from under socialist agitators and in part in
response to trade union and political pressures
brought about by the widening franchise in theWest. Pensions and insurance for workers wereﬁrst instituted in Germany under Bismarck and
spread to most of the rest of Western Europe.
Medical care, too, improved in the expanding
cities. Limits were set on the hours and kind ofwork children were allowed to perform. Universaleducation became the norm. The advances made
in the later nineteenth century were in many ways
extended after 1900.Democracy was gaining ground in the newcentury. The majority of men were enfranchisedin Western Europe and the US. The moreenlightened nations understood that good
government required a relationship of consent
between those who made the laws and the mass
of the people who had to obey them. The bestway to secure cooperation was through theprocess of popularly elected parliamentary assem-
blies that allowed the people some inﬂuence –
government by the will of the majority, at least 
in appearance. The Reichstag, the French Cham-
bers, the Palace of Westminster, the two Housesof Congress, the Russian Duma, all met insplendid ediﬁces intended to reﬂect their import-
ance. In the West the trend was thus clearly estab-
lished early in the twentieth century against
arbitrary rule. However much national constitu-tions differed, another accepted feature of thecivilised polity was the rule of law, the provision
of an independent judiciary meting out equal
justice to rich and poor, the powerful and theweak. Practice might differ from theory, butjustice was presented as blindfolded: justice to all,without favours to any.Equal rights were not universal in the West.Working people were struggling to form effective
unions so that, through concerted strike action,they could overcome their individual weaknesswhen bargaining for decent wages and condi-

tions. Only a minority, though, were members of
a union. In the US in 1900, only about 1 million
out of more than 27 million workers belonged to
a labour union. Unions in America were maledominated and, just as in Britain, women had toform their own unions. American unions also
excluded most immigrants and black workers.Ethnic minorities were discriminated againsteven in a political system such as that of the US,which prided itself as the most advanced democ-racy in the world. Reconstruction after the Civil
War had bitterly disappointed the African Ameri-
cans in their hopes of gaining equal rights. Their
claims to justice remained a national issue formuch of the twentieth century.All over the world there was discriminationagainst a group that accounted for half the earth’s
population – women. It took the American suf-
fragette movement half a century to win, in 1920,
the right to vote. In Britain the agitation forwomen’s rights took the drastic form of publicdemonstrations after 1906, but not until 1918
did women over thirty years of age gain the vote,
and those aged between twenty-one and thirty
had to wait even longer. But the acceptance ofvotes for women in the West had already beensignposted before the First World War. New
Zealand in 1893 was the ﬁrst country to grant
women the right to vote in national elections;
Australia followed in 1908. But even as the
twenty-ﬁrst century begins there are countries inthe Middle East where women are denied thisbasic right. Moreover, this struggle represents
only the tip of the iceberg of discrimination
against women on issues such as education, entry
into the professions, property rights and equal pay for equal work. Incomplete as emancipa-tion remains in Western societies, there are many
countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the
Middle East where women are still treated as 2PROLOGUE
inferior, the chattels of their fathers or husbands.In India, for example, orthodox Hindu marriagecustoms were not changed by law until 1955. As
for birth-control education, which began in the
West in the nineteenth century, freeing women
from the burden of repeated pregnancies, it didnot reach the women of the Third World untillate in the twentieth century – though it is there
that the need is greatest.The limited progress towards equal rightsachieved in the West early in the twentieth
century was not mirrored in the rest of the world.Imperialism in Africa and Asia saw its ﬁnal ﬂower-ing as the nineteenth century drew to a close. The
beneﬁts brought to the indigenous peoples of
Africa and Asia by the imposition of Western rule
and values was not doubted by the majority ofwhite people. ‘The imperialist feels a profoundpride in the magniﬁcent heritage of empire won
by the courage and energy of his ancestry’, wrote
one observer in 1899; ‘the spread of British rule
extends to every race brought within its spherethe incalculable benefits of just law, toleranttrade, and considerate government’.In 1900 Europeans and their descendants whohad settled in the Americas, Australasia and south-

ern Africa looked likely to dominate the globe.
They achieved this tremendous extension ofpower in the world because of the great size oftheir combined populations and because of the
technological changes which, collectively, are
known as the industrial revolution. One in every
four human beings lived in Europe, some 400 mil-
lion out of a total world population of 1,600million in 1900. If we add the millions who had
left Europe and multiplied in the Americas and
elsewhere, more than one in every three human
beings was European or of European descent. 
A century later, it was less than one in six; 61 percent of world’s population lives in Asia; there are more Africans than Europeans. In 1900 the
Europeans ruled a great world empire with a
population in Africa, Asia, the Americas and the
Paciﬁc of nearly 500 million by 1914. To put itanother way, before 1914 only about one in threepeople had actually avoided being ruled by Euro-

peans and their descendants, most of whom were
unshaken in their conviction that their dominationwas natural and beneﬁcial and that the only prob-lem it raised was to arrange it peacefully betweenthem. By the end of the twentieth century direct
imperial rule had all but disappeared.To the Asians and Africans, the European pre-sented a common front with only local variations:some spoke German, others French or English.There are several features of this common out-
look. First, there was the Westerners’ feeling of
superiority, crudely proven by their capacity to
conquer other peoples more numerous than the
invading European armies. Vast tracts of landwere seized by the Europeans, at very smallhuman cost to themselves, from the ill-equipped
indigenous peoples of Asia and Africa. That was
one of the main reasons for the extension of
European power over other regions of the world.Since the mid-nineteenth century the Europeanshad avoided ﬁghting each other for empire, since
the cost of war between them would have been
of quite a different order.Superiority, ultimately proven on the battle-ﬁeld, was, the Europeans in 1900 felt, but oneaspect of their civilisation. All other peoples they
thought of as uncivilised, though they recognised
that in past ages these peoples had enjoyed a kind
of civilisation of their own, and their artistic man-
ifestations were prized. China, India, Egypt and,later, Africa were looted of great works of art.Most remain to the present day in the museums
of the West.A humanitarian European impulse sought toimpose on the conquered peoples the Christianreligion, including Judaeo-Christian ethics, andWestern concepts of family relationships and con-
duct. At their best the Western colonisers were
genuinely paternalistic. Happiness, they believed,
would follow on the adoption of Western ways,
and the advance of mankind materially and spiri-tually would be accomplished only by overcomingthe prejudice against Western thought.From its very beginning, proﬁt and gain were also powerful spurs to empire. In the twentiethcentury industrialised Europe came to depend onthe import of raw materials for its factories;
Britain needed vast quantities of raw cotton to
turn into cloth, as well as nickel, rubber and1PROLOGUE3
copper. As its people turned it into the workshopof the world in the nineteenth century, so it reliedon food from overseas, including grain, meat,
sugar and tea, to feed the growing population.
Some of these imports came from the continent
of Europe close by, the rest from far aﬁeld – theAmericas, Australasia and India. As the twentiethcentury progressed, oil imports assumed an
increasing importance. The British mercantile
marine, the world’s largest, carried all these 
goods across the oceans. Colonies were regarded
by Europeans as essential to provide securesources of raw materials; just as important, theyprovided markets for industrialised Europe’s
output.Outside Europe only the US matched and,indeed, exceeded the growth of European indus-try in the first two decades of the twentiethcentury. Europe and the US accounted for virtu-
ally all the world trade in manufactured goods,
which doubled between 1900 and 1913. There
was a corresponding increase in demand for rawmaterials and food supplied by the Americas, Asia and the less industrialised countries of
Europe. Part of Europe’s wealth was used to
develop resources in other areas of the world: rail-
ways everywhere, manufacture and mining in
Asia, Africa and North and South America; butEurope and the US continued to dominate inactual production.Global competition for trade increased colonialrivalry for raw materials and markets, and the US
was not immune to the fever. The division of Asiaand Africa into outright European coloniesentailed also their subservience to the national
economic policies of the imperial power. Among
these were privileged access to colonial sources of
wealth, cheap labour and raw materials, domina-
tion of the colonial market and, where possible,shutting out national rivals from these beneﬁts.Thus, the US was worried at the turn of the
twentieth century about exclusion from what was
believed to be the last great undeveloped market
in the world – China. In an imperialist movementof great importance, Americans advanced acrossthe Paciﬁc, annexing Hawaii and occupying the
Philippines in 1898. The US also served notice 
of its opposition to the division of Chinainto
exclusive economic regions. Over the century aspecial relationship developed between Americaand China that was to contribute to the outbreak
of war between the US and Japan in 1941, with
all its consequences for world history.By 1900 most of Africa and Asia was alreadypartitioned between the European nations. With
the exception of China, what was left – the
Samoan islands, Morocco and the frontiers of
Togo – caused more diplomatic crises than was
warranted by the importance of such territories.Pride in an expanding empire, however, wasnot an attitude shared by everyone. There was also
an undercurrent of dissent. Britain’s GladstonianLiberals in the 1880s had not been carried away byimperialist fever. An article in the Pall MallGazettein 1884 took up the case for indigenouspeoples. ‘All coloured men’, it declared, ‘seem to
be regarded as fair game’, on the assumption that
‘no one has a right to any rule or sovereignty in
either hemisphere but men of European birth or
origin’. During theBoerWar(1899–1902) a cour-

ageous group of Liberals challenged the prevailing
British jingoism. Lloyd George, a future prime
minister, had to escape the fury of a Birming-
ham crowd by leaving the town hall disguised as apoliceman. Birmingham was the political base ofJoseph Chamberlain, the colonial secretary who
did most to propagate the ‘new imperialism’ and
to echo Cecil Rhodes’s call for the brotherhood of
the ‘Anglo-Saxon races’, supposedly the British,
the Germans and white Americans of British or
German descent. Americans, however, were not
keen to respond to the embrace.After the Spanish–American War of 1898 thecolonisation of the Philippines by the US led 
to a fierce national debate. One of the most 
distinguished and eloquent leaders of the Anti-
Imperialist League formed after that war de-nounced US policies in the Philippines and Cubain a stirring passage:This nation cannot endure half republic andhalf colony – half free and half vassal. Our form
of government, our traditions, our present
interests and our future welfare, all forbid our
entering upon a career of conquest.4PROLOGUE
Clearly, then, there was already opposition toimperialism on moral grounds by the beginningof the twentieth century. The opponents’ argu-
ments would come to carry more weight later in
the century. Morality has more appeal when it is
also believed to be of practical beneﬁt. As the
nineteenth century came to an end competition
for empire drove each nation on, fearful that to
lose out would inevitably lead to national decline.
In mutual suspicion the Western countries were
determined to carve up into colonies and spheres
of inﬂuence any remaining weaker regions.The expansion of Western power in the nine-teenth and early twentieth centuries carried withit the seeds of its own destruction. It was not any‘racial superiority’ that had endowed Western
man with a unique gift for organising society, 
for government or for increasing the productivity
of man in the factory and on the land. The West
took its knowledge to other parts of the world,
and European descendants had increased pro-

ductivity in manufacturing industries in the US
beyond that of their homelands. But high pro-
ductivity was not a Western monopoly: the
Japanese were the ﬁrst to prove, later in the twen-
tieth century, that they could exceed Western
rates.The Wars of American Independence demon-strated that peoples in one region of the world
will not for ever consent to be ruled by peoples
far distant. By 1900 self-government and separ-
ate nationhood had been won, through war or
through consent, by other descendants of Euro-
peans who had become Australians, Brazilians,
Argentinians, Canadians and, soon, South Afri-
cans. These national rebellions were led by white
Europeans. It remained a widespread European
illusion that such a sense of independence and
nationhood could not develop among the black
peoples of Africa in the foreseeable future. Apeople’s capacity for self-rule was crudely relatedto ‘race’ and ‘colour’, with the white race on top
of the pyramid, followed by the ‘brown’ Indians,
who, it was conceded, would one distant day be
capable of self-government. At the bottom of the
pile was the ‘black’ race. The ‘yellow’ Chinese
and Japanese peoples did not ﬁt easily into thecolour scheme, not least because the Japanese hadalready shown an amazing capacity to Westernise.Fearful of the hundreds of millions of people 
in China and Japan, the West thus conceived a 
dread of the yellow race striking back – the
‘yellow peril’.The spread of European knowledge under-
mined the basis of imperialist dominance. The
Chinese, the Japanese, the Koreans, the Indians
and the Africans would all apply this know-
ledge, and goods would be manufactured in
Tokyo and Hong Kong as sophisticated as those
produced anywhere else in the world. A new 
sense of nationalism would be born, resistant toWestern dominance and ﬁghting it with Westernscientiﬁc knowledge and weapons. When inde-
pendence came, older traditions would reassert
themselves and synthesise with the new know-
ledge to form a unique amalgam in each region.
The world remains divided and still too large and
diverse for any one group of nations, or for any
one people or culture, to dominate.All this lay in the future, the near future.Western control of most of the world appeared in
1900 to be unshakeable fact. Africa was parti-
tioned. All that was left to be shared out were two
nominally independent states, Morocco andEgypt, but this involved little more than tidyingup European spheres of influence. Abyssinia,
alone, had survived the European attack.The Ottoman Empire, stretching from BalkanEurope through Asia Minor and the Middle East
to the Indian Ocean, was still an area of intense
rivalry among the European powers. The inde-
pendent states in this part of the world could not
resist European encroachment, both economic
and political, but the rulers did succeed in retain-
ing some independence by manoeuvring between
competing European powers. The partition of the Middle East had been put off time and timeagain because in so sensitive a strategic area, on
the route to India, Britain and Russia never
trusted each other sufﬁciently to strike any lasting
bargain, preferring to maintain the Ottoman
Empire and Persia as impotent buffer states
between their respective spheres of interest. Much1PROLOGUE5
farther to the east lay China, the largest nation inthe world, with a population in 1900 of about420 million.When Western inﬂuence in China was threat-ened by the so-called Boxer rising in 1900, the
West acted with a show of solidarity. An inter-
national army was landed in China and ‘rescued’the Europeans. Europeans were not to be forcedout by ‘native’ violence. The Western powers’
ﬁnancial and territorial hold over China tight-

ened, though they shrank from the responsi-
bility of directly ruling the whole of China and
the hundreds of millions of Chinese living there.Instead, European influence was exerted indi-
rectly through Chinese ofﬁcials who were osten-
sibly responsible to a central Chinese government
in Peking. The Western Europeans detached a
number of trading posts from China proper, or acquired strategic bases along the coast andinland and forced the Chinese to permit the
establishment of semi-colonial international settle-

ments. The most important, in Shanghai, served
the Europeans as a commercial trading centre.
Britain enlarged its colony of Hong Kong byforcing China to grant it a lease of the adjacentNew Territories in 1898. Russia sought to annex
extensive Chinese territory in the north.With hindsight it can be seen that by the turnof the century the European world empires hadreached their zenith. Just at this point, though, anon-European Western power, the US, had
staked its ﬁrst claim to power and inﬂuence in the
Paciﬁc. But Europe could not yet, in 1900, call
in the US to redress the balance which Russiathreatened to upset in eastern Asia. That task wasundertaken by an eastern Asian nation – Japan.
Like China, Japan was never conquered by Euro-
peans. Forced to accept Western inﬂuence by the
Americans in the mid-nineteenth century, the
Japanese were too formidable to be thought of as‘natives’ to be subdued. Instead, the largestEuropean empire, the British, sought and won
the alliance of Japan in 1902 on terms laid down
by the Japanese leaders.Europe’s interests were global, and possiblefuture conﬂicts over respective imperial spherespreoccupied its leaders and those sections of
society with a stake in empire. United, theirpower in the world was overwhelming. But thestates of Europe were not united. Despite theirsense of common purpose in the world, European
leaders saw themselves simultaneously ensnared 
in a struggle within their own continent, a strug-
gle which, each nation believed, would decidewhether it would continue as a world power.The armaments race and competition forempire, with vast standing armies facing each
other and the new battleship fleets of dread-

noughts, were symptoms of increasing tension
rather than the cause of the Great War to come.Historians have debated why the West plungedinto such a cataclysmic conﬂict. Social tensions
within each country and the fears of the ruling
classes, especially in the kaiser’s Germany, indi-
rectly contributed to a political malaise during aperiod of great change. But as an explanation whywar broke out in 1914 the theory that a patriotic
war was ‘an escape forward’ to evade conﬂict at
home fails to carry conviction, even in the case of
Germany. It seems almost a truism to assert thatwars have come about because nations simply do not believe they can go on coexisting. It 
is, nevertheless, a better explanation than the
simple one that the primepurpose of nations atwar is necessarily the conquest of more territory.
Of Russia and Japan that may have been true inthe period 1900–5. But another assumption, atleast as important, was responsible for the Great
War. Among the then ‘great powers’, as they 
were called in the early twentieth century, there
existed a certain fatalism that the growth anddecline of nations must inevitably entail warbetween them. The stronger would fall on the
weaker and divide the booty between them. To
quote the wise and experienced British prime
minister, the third marquess of Salisbury, at the
turn of the century:You may roughly divide the nations of theworld as the living and the dying ... the weak

states are becoming weaker and the strong
states are becoming stronger ... the living
nations will gradually encroach on the territoryof the dying and the seeds and causes of
conﬂict among civilised nations will speedily
appear. Of course, it is not to be supposed that6PROLOGUE
any one of the living nations will be allowedto have the monopoly of curing or cutting upthese unfortunate patients and the controversy
is as to who shall have the privilege of doing
so, and in what measure he shall do it. These
things may introduce causes of fatal differ-ence between the great nations whose mightyarmies stand opposed threatening each other.
These are the dangers I think which threaten
us in the period that is coming on.In 1900 there were some obviously dyingempires, and the ‘stronger nations’ competing fortheir territories were the European great powers
and Japan. But during the years immediately pre-
ceding the Great War the issue had changed.
Now the great powers turned on each other inthe belief that some must die if the others wereto live in safety. Even Germany, the strongest of
them, would not be safe, so the Kaiser’s generals
believed, against the menace of a combination of
countries opposing it. That was the fatal assump-tion which, more than anything, led to the1914–18 war. It was reducing the complexity of
international relations to a perverse application of
Darwinian theory.The First World War destroyed the socialcohesion of pre-war continental Europe. TheAustro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires brokeup; Germany, before 1914 ﬁrst among the con-
tinental European countries, was defeated and
humiliated; Italy gained little from its enormous
sacriﬁces; the tsarist Russian Empire disintegrated,and descended into civil war and chaos. In theirdespair people sought new answers to the prob-
lems that threatened to overwhelm them, new
ideals to replace respect for kings and princes and
the established social order. In chaos a few ruth-
less men were able to determine the fate ofnations, ushering in a European dark age in mid-century. Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin were able to
create a more efﬁcient and crueller autocracy than
that of the Romanovs. The new truths were held
to be found in the works of Karl Marx as inter-preted by the Russian dictators, who imposedtheir ideas of communism on the people. In Italy
disillusionment with parliamentary government
led to fascism. In Germany, democracy survivedby a narrow margin but was demolished when itspeople despaired once more in the depression ofthe early 1930s. Hitler’s doctrine of race then
found a ready response, and his successes at home
and abroad conﬁrmed him in power.Different though their roots were, what thesedictators had in common was the rejection ofethics, a contempt for the sanctity of human life,
for justice and for equality before the law. They
accepted the destruction of millions of people in
the belief that it served desirable ends. They were
responsible for a revolution in thought and actionthat undid centuries of progress.Stalin and Hitler were not the ﬁrst leaders tobe responsible for mass killings. During the First
World War, the Turks had massacred Armenians,
ethnic hatred inﬂamed by fears that in war theArmenians would betray them. Stalin’s calculatedkilling of ‘class enemies’ and his murderous
purges of those from whom he suspected oppo-
sition were the actions of a bloody tyrant, by no
means the ﬁrst in history. The ruthless exploita-tion of slave labour, the murder of the Polishofﬁcers during the Second World War and the
expulsion of whole peoples from their homes,
revealed the depths to which an organised
modern state was capable of sinking. But nothing
in the history of a Western nation equals the Nazi state’s application of its theories of ‘good’which ended with the factory murder of millions
of men, women and children, mostly Jews and
gypsies. There were mass killings of ‘inferior
Slavs’, Russians and Poles, and those who wereleft were regarded as ﬁt only to serve as labourfor the German masters.The Nazi evil was ended in 1945. But it hadbeen overcome only with the help of the commu-
nist power of the Soviet Union. As long as Stalin
lived, in the Soviet Union and its satellite statesthe rights of individuals counted for little. In Asia,China and its neighbours had suffered war and
destruction when the Japanese, who adopted from
the West doctrines of racial superiority, forced
them into their cynically named ‘co-prosperitysphere’. The ordeal was not over for China whenthe Second World War ended. Civil war followed
until the victory of the communists. Mao Zedong
imposed his brand of communist theory on a1PROLOGUE7

Manymillions perished in the terror he unleashed, theclass war and as a result of experiments designed
to create an abundant communist society. In 
Asia, too, the regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia 
provided a more recent example of inhumanity in the pursuit of ideological theories amounting togenocide.By the close of the century the tide ﬁnallyturned against communist autocracy and dicta-
torship. The suffering and oppression all over the
world in the twentieth century was much greaterthan it had been in the nineteenth. Only theminority whose standards of living improved, who
lived in freedom in countries where representative
government remained an unbroken tradition, had
the promise of progress fulﬁlled through greaterabundance of wealth. But even in these fortunatesocieties few families were untouched by the
casualties of the wars of the twentieth century.
Western societies were spared the nightmare after
1945 of a third world war, which more than onceseemed possible, though they were not sparedwar itself. These wars, however, involved far
greater suffering to the peoples living in Asia,
Africa and the Middle East than to the West.The Cold War had divided the most powerfulnations in the world into opposing camps. TheWest saw itself as the ‘free world’ and the East as
the society of the future, the people’s alliance of
the communist world. They were competing for
dominance in the rest of the world, in Africa,Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, wherethe West’s overwhelming influence was chal-

lenged by the East. That struggle dominated the
second half of the twentieth century. Regional
conﬂicts in the world came to be seen through
the prism of the Cold War. Within the two blocsdifferences also arose, of which the most seriouswas the quarrel between the Soviet Union and
China, which further complicated developments
in Asia. That the Cold War never turned to a real
war between its protagonists was largely due toMAD, the doctrine of mutual assured destruc-tion. Both sides had piled up nuclear arsenals
capable of destroying each other and much of the
world, and there was no sure defence against allthe incoming missiles. Mutual assured destruc-tion kept the dangerous peace between them. Thebattle for supremacy was fought by other means,
including proxy wars between nations not
possessing the ‘bomb’ but armed and supported
by the nuclear powers.The abiding strength of nationalism from thenineteenth century right through the twentieth
has generally been underestimated by Western
historians. Hopes of peace for mankind and a
lessening of national strife were aroused by the
formation of the League of Nations after theGreat War of 1914–18. But long before the out-break of the Second World War the principle of
‘collective security’ had broken down when the
undertakings to the League by its member states
clashed with perceived national interests. TheUnited Nations began with a burst of renewedhope after the Second World War but could not
bridge the antagonisms of the Cold War. Both
the League and the UN performed useful inter-
national functions but their effectiveness waslimited whenever powerful nations refused theircooperation.Despite growing global interdependence onmany issues, including trade, the environment
and health, national interests were narrowly inter-
preted rather than seen as secondary to the inter-ests of the international community. Nationalismwas not diminished in the twentieth century by a
shrinking world of mass travel and mass com-
munication, by the universal possession of cheap
transistor radios and the widespread availability of television, nor by any ideology claiming toembrace mankind. To cite one obvious example,
the belief that the common acceptance of a com-
munist society would obliterate national and
ethnic conﬂict was exploded at the end of the
century, and nationalism was and still is repressedby force all over the world. Remove coercion, andnationalism re-emerges in destructive forms.But the world since 1945 has seen some posi-tive changes too. Nationalism in Western Europe
at least has been transformed by the experiencesof the Second World War and the success ofcooperation. A sign of better times is the spread
of the undefended frontier. Before the Second
World War the only undefended frontier between1PROLOGUE9
two sovereign nations was the long continentalborder between Canada and the US. By theclosing years of the century all the frontiers
between the nations of the European Union were
undefended. Today the notion of a war between
France and Germany or between Germany andany of its immediate neighbours has becomeunthinkable; a conﬂict over the territories they
possess is inconceivable, as is a war prompted by
the belief that coexistence will not be possible. To
that extent the international climate has greatly
changed for the better. But the possibility of suchwars in the Balkans, in Eastern Europe, in Asia,Africa and the Middle East remains ever present.No year goes by without one or more warsoccurring somewhere in the world, many of them
savage civil wars. What is new in the 1990s is thatthese wars no longer bring the most powerfulnations of the world into indirect conﬂict with
each other. The decision of Russia and the US to
cease arming and supplying opposing contest-
ants in the Afghan civil wars marked the end ofan indirect conﬂict that had been waged between the Soviet Union and the US since the Second
World War in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and
Latin America. But this understanding will not
banish wars. Intervention, whether by a group 
of nations acting under UN sponsorship or by amajor country acting as policeman, is costly. UNresources are stretched to the limits by peace-
keeping efforts in Cyprus, Cambodia, and former
Yugoslavia and other trouble spots. No universal
peacekeeping force exists. Intervention wouldtherefore be likely only when the nationalinterests of powerful countries became involved.
It would be less likely, where the need was purely
humanitarian.The world’s history is interwoven with migra-tions. The poor and the persecuted have left theirhomeland for other countries. The great move-
ment of peoples from Eastern to Western Europe
and further west across the Atlantic to the US,
Canada, the Argentine, Australasia and SouthAfrica continued throughout the nineteenthcentury, most of the emigrants being unskilled
workers from rural areas. But this free movement
of peoples, interrupted by the First World War,was halted soon after its close. In countries con-trolled by Europeans and their descendantsquotas were imposed, for example by the US
Immigration Act of 1924, denying free access to
further immigrants from Europe. These countries
so arranged their immigration policies that theyslowed down to a trickle or excluded altogetherthe entry of Asians and Africans. In the US the
exclusion of Asians from China and Japan had
begun well before 1914. They had been welcome
only when their labour was needed. The same
attitude became clear in Britain where immigra-tion of West Indians was at ﬁrst encouraged after1945, only to be restricted in 1962. The demand
for labour, ﬂuctuating according to the needs 
of a country’s economy, and the strength of 
racial prejudice have been the main underlyingreasons for immigration policies. While the Westrestricted intercontinental migrations after the
First World War, within Asia the movement con-
tinued, with large population transfers from
India, Japan and Korea to Burma, Malaya, Cey-lon, Borneo and Manchuria. Overseas Chinese inAsia play a crucial role, as do Indian traders in
sub-Saharan Africa.After the Second World War there were hugemigrations once more in Asia, Europe and the
Middle East. Millions of Japanese returned totheir homeland. The partition of the Indian sub-continent led to the largest sudden and forced
migration in history of some 25 million from 
east to west and west to east. At the close of the
war in Europe, West Germany absorbed 20million refugees and guest-workers from the East.Two million from Europe migrated to Canada
and to Australia; 3 million North Koreans ﬂed to
the South.The US experienced a changing pattern ofimmigration after the Second World War. Morethan 11 million people were registered as enter-ing the country between 1941 and 1980. The
great majority of immigrants had once been of
European origin. After 1945 increasing numbers
of Puerto Ricans and Filipinos took advantage oftheir rights of entry. There was a large inﬂux 
of Hispanics from the Caribbean; in addition
probably as many as 5 million illegal immigrants
crossed the Mexican border to ﬁnd low-paid work10PROLOGUE
in burgeoning California. The proportion ofEuropeans fell to less than one-ﬁfth of the totalnumber of immigrants. The second-largest ethnic
inﬂux came from Asia – Taiwan, Korea and, after
the Vietnam War, Vietnam. The US has become
more of a multicultural society than ever before.But, unlike most black people and Hispanics,many Asians have succeeded in working their way
out of the lower strata of American society.Although the migration of Europeans to Africasouth of the Sahara after 1945 was less spectacu-
lar in terms of numbers – probably less than amillion in all – their impact as settlers and admin-istrators on the history of African countries was
crucial for the history of the continent.One of the most signiﬁcant developments inthe Middle East after 1945 was the creation of anew nation, the State of Israel. Proportionally,migration into Israel saw the most rapid popula-
tion increase of any post-war state. Under the
Law of Return any Jew from any part of the world
had the right to enter and enjoy immediatecitizenship. Between May 1948 and June 1953the population doubled and by the end of 1956
had tripled to 1,667,000.There are no accurate statistics relating to thepeoples of the world who, since 1945, have been
driven by fear, hunger or the hope of betteropportunities to migrate. They probably exceed80 million. More than 10 million are still refugees
without a country of their own; political up-

heavals and famines create more refugees every
year. The more prosperous countries of the worldcontinue to erect barriers against entry from thepoor countries and stringently examine all those
who seek asylum. In Europe, the Iron Curtain has
gone but an invisible curtain has replaced it to
stop the ﬂow of migration from the East to the
West, from Africa across the Mediterranean, fromthe poor south of the world to the north.The only solution is to assist the poor coun-tries to develop so that their populations have a
hope of rising standards of living. The aid given
by the wealthy has proved totally inadequate tomeet these needs, and loans have led to soaringdebt repayments. The commodities the Third
World has to sell have generally risen in price less
than the manufacturing imports it buys. Thenatural disadvantage is compounded by corrup-tion, economic mismanagement, the waste ofresources on the purchase of weapons, wars and
the gross inequalities of wealth. But underlying
all these is the remorseless growth of population,
which vitiates the advances that are achieved.There has been a population explosion in thecourse of the twentieth century. It is estimated
that 1,600 million people inhabited planet earth
in 1900. By 1930 the figure reached 2,000
million, in 1970 it was 3,600 million and by 
the end of the century the world’s populationexceeded 6,000 million. Most of that increase,has taken place in the Third World, swelling the
size of cities like Calcutta, Jakarta and Cairo 
to many millions. The inexorable pressure of
population on resources has bedevilled efforts to improve standards of living in the poorestregions of the world, such as Bangladesh. The gap
between the poor parts of the world and the rich
widened rather than narrowed. Birth-control
education is now backed by Third World govern-ments, but, apart from China’s draconian appli-cation, is making a slow impact on reducing 
the acceleration of population growth. Despite
the suffering caused, wars and famines inﬂict no
more than temporary dents on the upward curve.
Only the experience with AIDS may prove differ-ent, if no cure is found: in sub-Saharan Africa thedisease is endemic, and in Uganda it has infected
one person in every six. The one positive measure
of population control is to achieve economic and
social progress in the poorest countries of theworld. With more than 800 million people livingin destitution the world is far from being in sight
of this goal.At the end of the twentieth century many of the problems that afﬂicted the world at its
beginning remain unresolved. The prediction ofThomas Robert Malthus in his Essay on thePrinciple of Populations published in 1798 that,unless checked, the growth of population would
outrun the growth of production, still blights
human hopes for progress and happiness in theThird World. According to one estimate, a thirdof all children under ﬁve, some 150 million, in
the Third World are undernourished and prey to
disease. Of the 122 million children born in1PROLOGUE11
1979, one in ten were dead by the beginning of 1981. In Africa there are still countries whereone child in four does not survive to its ﬁrst

birthday. In Western society, too rich a diet has
led to dramatic increases in heart disease. In the
Third World, according to the UN secretary-general in 1989, 500 million go hungry and everyyear there are 10 million more. The Brandt
report, North-South: A Programme for Survival(1980), offered an even higher estimate, and
declared that there was ‘no more important task
before the world community than the elimina-tion of hunger and malnutrition in all countries’.No one can calculate the ﬁgures with any accu-
racy. The world community has reacted only to
dramatic televised pictures of suffering and
famine, for example in the Horn of Africa, butthere is no real sense of global agreement on themeasures necessary to tackle the problem. Now
that the Third World is politically independent,
the former Western colonial powers are conveni-
ently absolved from direct responsibility.The political independence of the onceWestern-dominated globe represents an enor-
mous change, one that occurred much more
rapidly than was expected in the West before 
the Second World War. But in many countries
independence did not lead to better governmentor the blessings of liberty. Third World societieswere not adequately prepared, their wealth and
education too unequally distributed to allow any
sort of democracy to be established – although
this was accomplished in India. But on the Indiansubcontinent, as elsewhere in the former colonialstates, ethnic strife and bloodshed persist. Cor-
ruption, autocracy and the abuse of human rights
remain widespread.In eastern Asia at the beginning of the centurythe partition of China seemed to be at hand, and Japan already claimed to be the predomin-ant power. But China proved too large to be
absorbed and partitioned. The military conﬂict
between Japan and its Paciﬁc neighbours ended
only in 1945. By the close of the twentiethcentury it has emerged as an economic super-power decisively influencing world economic
relations. China, economically still poor but
developing rapidly, remains by far the largest and most populous uniﬁed nation in the world.By the end of the century the last foreign out-posts taken from it before the twentieth century,
Hong Kong and Macao, have become part of its
national territory again. Apart from Vietnam,
Cuba and North Korea, China in the twenty-ﬁrstcentury is the last communist state in the world.At the beginning of the century Karl Marx had inspired socialist thinking and, indeed, 
much political action in the Western world. The
largest socialist party in 1900 was in the kaiser’s
Germany. But these socialist parties believed that the road to power lay through constitutionalmeans. Revolutionaries were on the fringe – one
of them the exiled Lenin in Zurich – their
prospects hopeless until the First World War
transformed them and created the possibility of violent revolutions in the East. By the end ofthe century, in an overwhelmingly peaceful revo-
lution communism and the cult of Marxism–
Leninism have been discredited. Whatever takes
their place will change the course of the twenty-first century. The unexpected revolutions thatswept through central and Eastern Europe from
1989 to 1991 were, on the whole, no less peace-
ful. In every corner of the globe the autocratic,
bureaucratic state faced a powerful challenge. The
comparative economic success and social progressachieved by the West through the century proveddesirable to the rest of the world, as did its insti-
tutions, especially the ‘free market’ and ‘democ-
racy’ with a multi-party system. But how will
these concepts be transferred to societies whichhave never practised them?‘Freedom’, ‘democracy’ and the ‘free market’are simple concepts but their realisation is beset
by ambiguity. In societies lately subjected to
autocratic rule, how much freedom can be
allowed without risking disintegration intoanarchy and disorder? Not every culture embracesWestern ideals of democracy as a desirable goal.
There is no Western country that permits a free
market to function without restraint, without
protecting the interests of workers and con-sumers. These institutional restraints have takenyears to develop. How large a role should the
state play? Not everything can be privatised, and
certainly not instantly. How large a welfare system12PROLOGUE
needs to be created? ‘Communism’ too has lostprecise meaning. Communism in China today isvery different from the communism of thirty years
ago, now that private enterprises are ﬂourishing.
Labels change their meaning. Nor do simple
slogans provide the answers.At the beginning of the twentieth century onecould believe that a better world was gradually
emerging. History was the story of progress. For
some this meant that socialist ideals would lead to
a utopia before the century had come to an end. In
mid-century that faith in human progress and inthe inevitable march of civilisation was shattered.The power of National Socialism and its destruc-

tive master-race doctrine were broken; it was the
end of an evil empire but not the end of tyranny.
The horrors, corruption and inefﬁciency of autoc-
racy, with its denial of humanity, lie exposed.As the world moves from the twentieth to thetwenty-ﬁrst century old conﬂicts are fading and
new ones taking shape. Europe, so long a crucible
of global conﬂict, is coming together; war in theWest is unthinkable and conﬂicts with the Easthave been overcome. In Europe the nation states
have voluntarily pooled their national independ-
ence, in the economic sphere most completely,
and in foreign relations imperfectly. The US has
gained the position as the only global militarysuperpower, though this does not give it limitlesscontrol. The Cold War that dominated so much
of the second half of the twentieth century world-
wide is over, the Soviet Union has normalised its
relations with the rest of the world, and the restof the world with it. But much of the Middle Eastand Africa remains unreconstructed, in a stage of
transition, divided and in conflict. Ideological
extremists have tried to create new divisions
between Muslim culture and Western culture but,
though able to create powerful impacts, representa minority of the Muslim world. A new feature isthat conﬂict is no longer necessarily based on
clashes between nation states. Terrorist organisa-tions act transnationally and cause havoc with theweapons of today’s technologies, whether planesﬁlled with fuel, hand-held missiles or biological
weapons. Weapons of mass destruction can be
stored by small nations and could fall into the
wrong hands. Nuclear weapons have proliferatedas well as missiles and are no longer the preserveof the most powerful.The US also remains the most powerful econ-
omy, Japan the second, after stagnating for a
decade, began to recover in 2004. China is trans-

forming, pointing to the growth of a powerfuleconomy later in the twenty-ﬁrst century. The
world has learnt that it beneﬁts all to conduct

trade with a minimum of barriers though many
remain to be removed. Standards of living have
risen with technological progress beyond whatgenerations a hundred years ago could havedreamt of. Medical progress in the developed
world has increased life expectancy. But the world
is one of even more extremes. The developed
world is prosperous and the worst of poverty ban-
ished. But the majority of people in Africa, LatinAmerica and eastern Asia remain sunk in poverty,
only small groups enjoying a, generally corrupt,
high life with little social conscience for the rest.
Famine remains widespread and in parts of the
world such as sub-Saharan Africa AIDS is ravagingthe people. The rich world’s help for the poor iswholly inadequate still, but without reform, such
aid as is provided frequently does not reach those
most in need of it. There are huge global problems
that remain to be addressed in the twenty-ﬁrst cen-
tury, not least among them the deterioration ofthe global environment. How successfully they
will be addressed in the decades to come remains
shrouded from contemporary view.Having considered just some of the changes inthe world between the opening of the twentiethand the twenty-ﬁrst centuries, the chapters thatfollow will recount the tumultuous history
between.1PROLOGUE13
1Part I
SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL
RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
During the ﬁrst half of the twentieth centuryEurope suffered a cataclysmic change. The lives
of millions were destroyed, millions more lives
blighted. What led to such a chain of catastro-phes? The fratricidal Great War marks the turningpoint in the history of Europe. There is no single
cause that explains it all, but a multiplicity that
need to be untangled. Paradoxically industrial
progress also promised better living for Europe’s
people, the very industrial progress that increasedmanifold the impact of war.At the heart of Europe’s conflict was themutual fear of the ‘hereditary foes’, France and
Germany. Around this core, other countries lined
up on one side or the other, every local regionalconﬂict that might have been settled as before bylimited war, threatened to engulf the whole of
Europe, until it ﬁnally did so.Europe would not come to rest as long asnational leaders believed in a Darwinian world of
conflict where the strong must either growstronger or succumb. Ultimately, the convictiongrew that there could only be one superpower in
the world. The process of reaching that end
seemed inevitable. Mass armies, guns, battle-
ships were the means to that end. It was only amatter of time. Statesmanship was about judg-ing when the time was ripe to strike. Meantime, 
while Europe was moving toward Armageddon,
political and social change accelerated. It was 
not inevitable that the people would follow their national leaders. Tragically they did, underpatriotic ﬂags. The weak band of internationalMarxists early in the century denounced the
imperialist leaders, but they too did not preach
peace. They wished to replace wars betweennations with civil wars within. The voices of peaceand reason condemning a European fratricidal
conﬂict were drowned.IMPERIAL GERMANY: ACHIEVEMENT ANDEXCESSImperial Germany symbolised success. Created inthree victorious wars, it had replaced France as
the ﬁrst military power in Europe. The Prussianspirit was seen to be matched by astonishingprogress in other directions. In all branches of
education and scientiﬁc discovery, the German
Empire stood second to none. In manufacture,
German industry grew by leaps and bounds. The
secret of its success seemed to lie in the Prussiangenius for organisation and in the orderliness andself-discipline of its hard-working people. There
were a lot of them, too – nearly 67 million in
1913; this made the Germans the second most
populous nation of Europe, well ahead of Franceand Britain, and behind only Russia.By the turn of the century Germany hadbecome a predominantly industrial nation, with
large cities. For every German working on the
land, two were engaged in manufacture on theeve of the First World War. Once far behind1Chapter 1HEREDITARY FOES AND 
UNCERTAIN ALLIES
Britain in coal production, by 1914 Germany had almost closed the gap and, after the US and
Britain, was the third industrial power in the
world. Coal, iron and steel, produced in ever
larger quantities, provided the basis for Ger-
many’s leap forward, challenging Britain’s role asEurope’s leader.Between 1871 and 1914 the value of Ger-many’s agricultural output doubled, the value of
its industrial production quadrupled and its over-
seas trade more than tripled. Germany’s progressaroused anxieties among its neighbours, but therewas also cooperation and a recognition that the
progress of one European nation would, in fact,
enrich the others. Germany was catching up with
Britain, the pioneer of the industrial revolution,but Britain and Germany were also importanttrading partners.Unlike Britain, the German Empire was trans-formed in a relatively short time from a well-
ordered, mainly rural country to a modern
industrial nation. In contrast with its industrialprogress, the pace of Germany’s political devel-opment was slow, deliberately retarded by its
ruling men. The government of the Prussian-
German Monarchy after 1871 was a mixture of
traditional mid-nineteenth-century institutions,together with an imperial parliament – theReichstag – more in harmony with the new
democratic age. But the old traditional Junker
society found allies after 1871 among the big
industrialists in its opposition to the advance ofdemocracy. The cleavage so created between thepowerful few and the rest of society, in the nameof maintaining the power of the Crown, was
responsible for the continuation of social and
political divisions in Wilhelmine Germany down
to the outbreak of war.The foundations of the empire were fashionedby Otto von Bismarck. He was aware of the
dangers facing the recently unified country at
home and abroad and juggled the opposing forces
and contradictions with manipulative brilliance
but ultimately without success. Internal uniﬁca-
tion was successful. Just sufficient autonomy was left to the twenty-ﬁve states, with the illusion

of inﬂuence, to satisfy them. Prussia was by far
the most powerful of all; the chancellor of
Germany was usually also the prime minister ofPrussia. The autonomy of the states also limitedthe degree of democratic control. The ‘English
system’ of representative government was anath-

ema to Bismarck. Democratic aspirations were sat-

isﬁed by the elections of the Reichstag on the
most democratic franchise in the world, everyadult male had the vote and Germany was dividedinto equal electorates of one hundred thousand
people. The trick was to limit the powers of the
Reichstag by restricting its powers of taxation, and
reserving taxes on income to the undemocraticstate parliaments. Prussia’s was elected by threeclasses of electors, the wealthiest few electing as
many representatives as the poorest masses. The
chancellor of the empire, who appointed the min-

isters, was not dependent on the Reichstag butwas appointed by the emperor. He could juggle18SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14

the political parties and change horses to securethe majorities he needed to pass bills. It workedafter a fashion, though corruptly under Bismarck.
He was ﬁrst a free trader, then a protectionist; he
persecuted the Catholic Church and its political
Centre party, then made his peace with them; hetried to destroy the Social Democratic Party, butfailed. Bismarck was the pilot, the old emperor
placed his trust in him. With his death and the
accession of his volatile grandson Wilhelm II the
strains of Bismarck’s system were beginning to
show. By 1912 the Social Democratic Party hadwon a majority in the Reichstag.The Social Democratic Party was denouncedas revolutionary, its members as ‘enemies of the
state’ – an extraordinary and unwarranted attack
on a party operating fully within the law. Thedefeat of social democracy was the main purposeof the Conservatives and the men surrounding
the kaiser. They could not conceive of including
the Social Democrats within the fabric of the
political state. This was more understandablewhile the Social Democratic Party was indeedMarxist and revolutionary. But as the twentieth
century advanced the great majority of the party
members in 1913, led by the pragmatic Friedrich
Ebert, had become democratic socialists working
for gradual reform; their Marxist revolutionarydoctrine was becoming more a declaration ofoutward faith than actual practice, or immediate
expectation. In a number of the state parliaments,
Social Democrats had already joined coalitions
with Liberals to form a responsible base for gov-ernments, thus abandoning their revolutionaryrole. But in Prussia this was unthinkable.One consequence of the narrow outlook of theConservatives was that they would never consent
to constitutional change that would have made
the chancellor and his ministers responsible to theReichstag as the government in Britain was toParliament. The Conservatives thus had no alter-
native but to leave power, in theory at least,
ultimately in the hands of the kaiser. The kaiser’s
pose as the ‘All Highest’ was ridiculous, and eventhe ﬁction could not be maintained when, afterthe kaiser’s tactless DailyTelegraph 
interview in1908, he claimed that he had helped Britain
during the Boer War.Kaiser Wilhelm II did not have the strength tolead Germany in the right direction. He was anintelligent man of warm and generous impulse at
times, but he was also highly emotional and
unpredictable. He felt unsure of his ﬁtness for his
‘divine calling’, and posed and play-acted. Thiswas a pity as his judgement was often intuitivelysound. He did not act unconstitutionally, leaving
control of policy to his ministers and military
men. But when, in an impasse or conﬂict between
them, the decision was thrust back to him, he
occasionally played a decisive role. More usuallyhe was manipulated by others, his vanity makinghim an easy victim of such tactics. He wanted 
to be known as the people’s kaiser and as the
kaiser of peace; also as the emperor during whose
reign the German Empire became an equal of theworld’s greatest powers. His contradictory aimsmirrored a personality whose principal traits were
not in harmony with each other.The kaiser, and the Conservative–industrialalliance, were most to blame for the divisiveness ofGerman society and politics. There was constanttalk of crisis, revolution or pre-emptive action by
the Crown to demolish the democratic institutions
of the Reich. Much of this was hysterical.But the Wilhelmine age in German develop-ment was not entirely bleak. The judiciaryremained substantially independent and guaran-teed the civil rights of the population and a free
press; there was a growing understanding among
the population as a whole that Kaiser Wilhelm’s
pose as the God-ordained absolute ruler was justplay-acting. Rising prosperity was coupled withthe increasing moderation of the left and the
growth of trade unions. The political education
of the German people proceeded steadily, even if
inhibited by the narrowly chauvinistic outlook 
of so many of the schoolmasters and universityprofessors, by the patronage of the state as anemployer, and by the Crown as a fount of titles,
decorations and privileges. Signiﬁcantly, the anti-
Conservative political parties on the eve of 1914
commanded a substantial majority, even thoughthey could not work together.The deep political and social divisions neverreally threatened Germany with violence and civil
war in the pre-war era. Over and above the1HEREDITARY FOES AND UNCERTAIN ALLIES19
conﬂict, the German people, including the SocialDemocrats, felt a strong sense of national pridein the progress of the ‘fatherland’. Furthermore,
the last peacetime chancellor of imperial Ger-

many, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, recog-
nised that constitutional reform was a matter oftime. But there was not sufﬁcient time.The Social Democrats, the Progressives andCentre, who had won a majority in the 1912 elec-
tions, demanded a constitutional monarchy
responsible to the Reichstag. The Conservatives
chose to regard this challenge as provoking a con-stitutional crisis, threatening the Wilhelminestate. But did they unleash a war deliberately to
preserve their position and to avoid reform? To
be sure, there were Conservatives and militarists
who saw a successful war as a means of defeatingdemocratic socialism. The chancellor, BethmannHollweg, was not one of them. Nevertheless, it
was an element of the situation that the kaiser and
his supporters saw themselves in a hostile world
surrounded by enemies at home and abroad.There developed in the increasingly militarisedcourt a wild and overheated atmosphere, a fear
and pessimism about the future. While German
society as a whole had good reasons for conﬁ-
dence and satisfaction on the eve of the 
war, the increasingly isolated coterie around thekaiser suffered more and more from hystericalnightmares inimical to cool judgement.They were carried forward in 1914 by a tideof events they had themselves done much to
create. In the summer of 1914 war was seen as alast desperate throw to stave off Germany’s oth-erwise inevitable decline. Bethmann Hollweg laid
the blame for the outbreak of war on cosmic
forces, on the clash of imperialism and national-
ism, and, specifically, on British, French and
Russian envy of Germany’s progress. Germany, sohe claimed, could have done little to change this.But did its growth of power make the struggle 
in Europe inevitable or did its own policies 
contribute to war and its ‘encirclement’?Twenty-six years earlier, in 1888, at the time ofthe accession of Wilhelm II, Germany appearednot only secure but on the threshold of a new
expansion of power, world power. The contrast of
mood and expectations between then and 1914could not have been greater. Bismarck hadadopted the same manipulative approach as athome to safeguard the new empire. In a famous
passage in his memoirs he spoke of his recurr-
ing ‘nightmare of coalitions’. By this he meant 
that Germany’s neighbours would combine andsurround and threaten Germany. The dangerstemmed from a fatal error he had made in his
primitive treatment of defeated France. France
was forced to pay a war indemnity and, worse, lost
a large slice of territory, the provinces of Alsace
and Lorraine.Why had Bismarck, who had treated thedefeated Danes and Austrians generously, unchar-
acteristically ensured that France would harbour
hatred for its German neighbour for the next ﬁfty
years? The reason is that Bismarck believed that agenuine reconciliation with France, the hereditaryenemy, was impossible. At the heart of his diplo-
macy lay the need to keep France weak and to
isolate it. His alliance system succeeded but with
increasing difficulty and contradictions. Whatmade it plausible was his genuine declaration thatGermany was satiated, hankered after no more
territory. He could thus act on the continent for
two decades as the ‘honest broker’ in mediating
the disputes of others. The most serious arose
from the decline of power of the Ottoman Turks.The Habsburg Empire and tsarist Russia andGreat Britain eyed each other with suspicion
when it came to the inheritance and inﬂuence
among the weak, unstable nations emerging from
the decay of Turkey in the Balkans. Brief warsﬂared up and were smothered by great-powerdiplomacy with Bismarck’s assistance.The efforts to prevent a hostile coalition fromcoming together began to break down even
before Kaiser Wilhelm II ‘dropped the pilot’, dis-
missing the aged chancellor in 1890. Bismarck’sgenius was to bind nations in rivalry together in aweb of alliances at the pivot of which lay Germany,
while isolating France. But this construction was
beginning to come apart at the seams. In 1890
Germany ‘cut the wire to St Petersburg’, the reinsurance alliance that had bound Germany andRussia. Now Russia was isolated, which created
the conditions for France and Russia, republic and
tsarist imperial regime, to come together in a20SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
military pact four years later. It was the beginningof the process that split Europe into two opposingcamps. Britain tried to assume the mantle of hon-
est broker but too many imperial interests of its
own, which brought it into conﬂict with Russia,
stood in the way.Germany added to its problems by beingblinded by a vision of Weltpolitik,worldwide
power; a latecomer in the colonial carve-up,
Germany was now demanding its place in the sun.
Unless a world power, the inheritor of the British
Empire, its chauvinist leaders thought, Germany’seventual decline was certain. German foreignpolicy swung from apprehension at the growing
menace of the French–Russian alliance with a
nightmare vision of a Russian army of millions
marching into East Prussia while the Frenchmassed in the West, to bold strokes making itsweight felt when it came to sharing out the
remaining dishes of the imperialist dinner.The two sides of this policy were forcingFrance and Britain to make concessions in Westand East Africa while building up Tirpitz’s bat-tleship ﬂeet and drawing up the Schlieffen Plan 
to cope with a two-front war. France would be
invaded ﬁrst riding roughshod over Belgian neu-
trality and then Russia. Its foreign policy turned
Britain from the path of seeking an alliance at theturn of the century to forming military defensivearrangements and imperial settlements with
France and Russia in 1904 and 1907. Meantime
Germany became more and more reliant on a
weakening ally, the Habsburg Monarchy beset bythe problems of keeping a multinational stategoing. The year 1912 was fateful for Germany at
home and abroad. Its bullying tactics had gained
it just small prizes in Morocco and Africa while
causing great friction. Bismarckian diplomacy was
turned on its head. In the Balkan cauldron,Germany even feared that Russia and Austriamight reach an amicable accommodation and
then Germany would lose its reliable ally. Italy
had long ceased to be completely loyal. Chan-
cellor Bethmann Hollweg, imperial Germany’slast peacetime chancellor, tried hard to evade thedark clouds gathering, but he had to deal not
only with growing conﬂicts in the Balkans, but
also with the powerful army chiefs at home whohad the kaiser’s ear and were urging a preventivewar before Russia grew too strong.Bethmann Hollweg could still count onTirpitz and his ever-unready navy to aid him in
urging a delay in bringing about conﬂict. The
desirability of launching a preventive war againstFrance and Russia was discussed by the kaiser andhis principal military advisers, meeting in a so-
called war council, in December 1912. The kaiser
had had one of his periodical belligerent brain-
storms, this time brought about by a warning
received from Britain that it would not leaveFrance in the lurch if Germany attacked it.Nothing aroused the kaiser to greater fury than
to be scorned by Britain. But the secret meeting
of 8 December 1912 did no more than postpone
war. A consensus among all those present wasachieved in the end; Admiral Tirpitz had opposedthe army, which urged that war should be
unleashed quickly; after debate all agreed to wait
but not much beyond 1914. They were also
agreed that Germany would lose all chance ofdefeating Russia and France on land if the warwas longer delayed. Speedier Russian troop move-
ments to the German frontier along railway lines
ﬁnanced by the French would make the Schlieffen
Plan inoperable because Russia would be able to
overwhelm Germany’s weak screen of defence inthe east before the German army in the westcould gain its victory over France.The most sinister aspect of the meeting ofDecember 1912 was the cynical way in which the
kaiser’s military planned to fool the Germanpeople and the world about the true cause of thewar. It was to be disguised as a defensive war
against Russia in support of the Habsburg
Empire. In the coming months, they agreed, the
German people should be prepared for war.Still, a war postponed is a war avoided.Bethmann Hollweg was not yet convinced orﬁnally committed. Wilhelm II could and, in July
1914, actually did change his mind. As the
German chief of staff rightly observed, what he
feared was not ‘the French and the Russians asmuch as the Kaiser’.Nevertheless, in 1913 the needs of the armydid become ﬁrst priority; a bill passed by the
Reichstag increased the hitherto fairly static1HEREDITARY FOES AND UNCERTAIN ALLIES21
standing army by calling up an additional136,000 conscripts. This measure was designedto bring the peacetime strength of the army to
nearly 800,000 men by the autumn of 1914.Bethmann Hollweg scored one success. Theabrasive Weltpolitik overseas was downgraded.Instead, Germany now pushed its interests in AsiaMinor and Mesopotamia and developed its new
friendship with Turkey. The projected Berlin-to-
Baghdad railway was to be the economic artery of
this, Germany’s new imperial commercial sphere.
The intrusion of German interests in the MiddleEast was not unwelcome to Britain since Germanywould help to act as a buffer against Russian
expansion.In the Balkans, where a second Balkan war hadbroken out in 1913, Bethmann Hollweg and theBritish foreign secretary, Sir Edward Grey,worked together to localise the conﬂict and to
ensure a peaceful outcome. The kaiser’s confer-
ence of December 1912 had at least made it
much easier for Bethmann Hollweg to follow apaciﬁc policy in 1913 and he could show somesuccess for it, though not a weakening of Britain’s
support for France, his main objective. Neverthe-
less, the drift to war in Germany was unmistak-
able. Its leaders were accustoming themselves to
the idea of a war, persuaded by the seeminglyirrefutable logic of the military. In the end, in thesummer of 1914, Bethmann Hollweg too would
be carried forward with the kaiser over the brink.REPUBLICAN FRANCE: FROM THE ‘BELLE EPOQUE’ TO WARThe German Empire symbolised to contem-poraries in 1900 discipline, union and progress;
France was generally seen as a country divided,whose politicians’ antics could scarcely be takenseriously, a society sinking into corruption and
impotence. The malevolence of that corruption
had been demonstrated in the highest reaches of
the army, the Church and politics by the Dreyfusaffair, the innocent Captain having been found in1899 yet again guilty of espionage. The slander
against the Jews living in France achieved a
degree of viciousness not seen anywhere in acivilised country. Only Russia could compete.Yet, the better-off ﬂocked to France. Paris wasacknowledged as perhaps the most beautiful city
in the world, certainly the artistic capital of
Europe. The Riviera was becoming the holiday
playground of European society.Foreigners, of course, realised that there wasmore to France than the surface glitter of Paris
and the Riviera. Few of them could understand 
a country so varied, so divided and so individual-
istic. Governments changed so frequently that
in any other country such a state of affairs would have meant the nation was close to chaos,ungovernable. Yet, in everyday life, France was 
a stable country with a strong currency, and well
ordered. Europe with monarchs and princes
looked askance at republican France with itsofficial trappings derived from the revolution of 1789. Yet France was far more stable than 
it seemed and by 1914 had achieved a quite
remarkable recovery as a great power.Can we now discern more clearly how govern-ment and society functioned in France, somethingthat mystiﬁed contemporaries?The key to an understanding of this question isthat the majority of French people wished to deny
their governments and parliaments the opportuni-
ties to govern boldly, to introduce new policiesand change the course of French life. France wasdeeply conservative. What most of the French
wanted was that nothing should be done that
would radically alter the existing state of affairs in
town and country or touch their property and sav-ings. Thus the Republic became the symbol oforder, the best guarantee of the status quo against
those demanding great changes. The monarchist
right were now the ‘revolutionaries’, something
they had in common with the extreme left.One explanation for this innate conservatism isthat France did not experience the impact of rapid22SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14

population growth and rapid industrialisation.For close on half a century from 1866 to 1906
the occupations of the majority of the working
population altered only gradually. Whereas in1866 half the working population was engaged inagriculture, ﬁsheries and forestry, by 1906 it was
still nearly 43 per cent. Employment in industry
during the same years scarcely changed at all,
from 29 per cent to 30.6 per cent. The tariff pro-
tected what was in the main a society of small pro-ducers and sellers. In industry small workshops
employing less than ﬁve people predominated, as
did the old, established industrial enterprises of
clothing and textiles. But this is not the wholepicture. Productivity on the land and in industryrose. New industries such as electricity, chemicals
and motor cars developed with considerable
success. France possessed large iron reserves in
French Lorraine which enabled it to become not
only an exporter in iron but also a steel producer.Large works were built at Longwy on theLuxembourg frontier, and the Le Creusot works
rivalled Krupps as armament manufacturers. Coal
mining in the Pas de Calais developed rapidly in
response, but France remained heavily dependenton Britain and Germany for coal imports to coverall its needs. Production ﬁgures show that France,
with a fairly stable population, was overtaken dra-
matically as an industrial nation by Germany,
whose population increased (see tables above).
For this reason France’s success in maintaining itsposition in exports and production, judged perhead of population, can easily be overlooked.In one respect – the provision of capital ﬁnancefor Europe – France won ﬁrst place, and the large
proportion of its total investment overseas thatwent to Russia between 1890 and 1914 becamea major factor in international relations.The majority of the French people did notwish to face the fact that new problems were
arising that required new solutions; they saw the
‘defence’ of the Republic in terms of combatingthe political aims of the Church and the army.But in the early twentieth century the growth and
concentration of industry and a new militancy
among groups of workers also threatened the
Republic from the left. The majority groups ofthe parliamentary lower Chamber were deter-
mined to defeat these threats from the extreme
right or the left. Political power depended on the
management of the elected Chamber; govern-

ments came and went, but the legislation pre-pared by the Chamber provided the necessarycontinuity. Actual office was confined to a
number of leading politicians who reappeared in
ministry after ministry. In this scheme of things
few Frenchmen cared how many ministries were
formed. Their frequency, in itself, was a healthyobstacle to too much government, for Frenchmenhad singularly little faith in their politicians.There existed side by side with the elected gov-ernment an administration with an ethos of its
own and which had little connection with thedemocratic roots of government. This centralisedadministration had been little modiﬁed through
all the constitutional change since its creation in
1800 by Napoleon. It made the head of state the
chief executive, while the prefects were the state’s
representatives and administrators in each of theninety geographical departments into whichFrance was divided. They were appointed, and
could be transferred or dismissed, by the Ministry
of the Interior.The prefects dealt directly with each ministryand on the whole kept aloof from politics; theywere hand-picked administrators who carried out1HEREDITARY FOES AND UNCERTAIN ALLIES23

the decrees of the state. Each prefect in his depart-ment had his own administration which could beappealed against only by putting the case to the
Council of State in Paris. The prefects were not, of
course, elected; they deliberately did not grow
local roots but represented, in theory at least, animpersonal justice. They were powerful men whocontrolled enormous patronage in their depart-
ment; they could make appointments to many
paid posts from archivists to some grades of
schoolteachers, tax collectors and post-ofﬁce staff.
They stood at the head of the social hierarchy, andwere a guarantee of stability and conservatism. Inthis way France was at one and the same time both
highly centralised but also decentralised; for the
ordinary French citizens ‘government’ in practice
meant what the prefect and his administration did,not what was happening in far-off Paris. Francehas had the good fortune to attract to this type of
higher administrative service, over a long period of
time, many capable men.The Republic stood for the defence of propertyand a well-ordered, static society. At the sametime it was identiﬁed in the minds of its support-
ers as the bastion of the enlightenment and so,
curiously, despite their frozen attitude towards the
desirability of social change, republicans saw
themselves as the people who believed in progressand the modern age. This was only possiblebecause they could identify an ‘enemy to progress’
in the Church and its teachings. More passion was
expended on the question of the proper role of the
Church and the state during the ﬁrst three decadesof the Third Republic than on social questions. Inevery village the secular schoolteacher represented
the Republic and led the ranks of the enlight-
ened; the priest led the faithful and the Church
demanded liberty to care for the spiritual welfare
of Catholics not only in worship but also in edu-cation. Republicans decried the inﬂuence of theChurch as obscurantist and resisted especially 
its attempts to capture the minds of the rising
generation of young French people.The Church was supported by the monarchists,most of the old aristocracy and the wealthier sec-tions of society; but ‘class’ division was by no
means so complete and simple as this suggests: the
Church supporters were not just the rich and pow-erful. The peasantry was divided: in the west andLorraine, they were conservative and supportedthe Church; elsewhere anti-clericalism was wide-
spread. In the towns, the less well-off middle
classes and lower ofﬁcials were generally fervid in
their anti-clericalism. Their demand for a ‘separa-tion’ of state and Church meant in practice thatthe Church should lose certain rights, most
importantly, its right to separate schools. The
Catholic Church in France by supporting the los-
ing monarchial cause was responsible in good part
for its own difﬁculties. In the 1890s the Vaticanwisely decided on a change and counselled FrenchCatholics to ‘rally’ to the Republic and to accept
it; but the ralliement was rejected by most of theFrench Catholic bishops and the Church’s monar-
chist supporters. The Dreyfus affair polarised theconﬂict with the Church, the monarchists and the army on one side and the republicans on the
other. Whether one individual Jewish captain was
actually guilty or not of the espionage of which he
stood accused seemed to matter little when thehonour of the army or Republic was at stake.Dreyfus’s cause united all republicans and theytriumphed. In May 1902, though the electoral
vote was close, the republicans won some 370 seats
and the opposition was reduced to 220. There
then followed three years of sweeping legislationagainst the Church. Church schools were closedwholesale; a number of religious orders were
banned; in 1904 members of surviving religious
orders were banned from teaching. In December
1905 a Law of Separation between Church andstate was passed. This law represents both the cul-
mination of republican anti-clericalism and the
beginning of a better relationship. Freedom of
worship was guaranteed and, despite the opposi-

tion of the Vatican, the bitter struggle was gradu-

ally brought to a close. Anti-clericalism declined,and the monarchist right lost its last opportunity ofenlisting mass support with the help of the
Church. Extreme anti-clerical governments were
now followed by more moderate republicans in
power.French governments before 1904 remaineddependent not on one party but on the support
of a number of political groupings in the Cham-
ber; these groups represented the majority of24SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
socially conservative voters: the peasants whoowned their land, shopkeepers, craftsmen, civilservants and pensioners with small savings.
Governments were formed around groups of the
centre, sometimes veering more to the ‘left’ and
sometimes to the ‘right’. But ‘left’ in the Frenchparliamentary sense did not mean socialism. Oncethe predominant groupings of radical republicans
had succeeded in defeating the Church, their rad-
icalism was mild indeed. They stood for defend-
ing the interests of the peasant land proprietors,
the shopkeepers, the less well-off in society; theirsocialism went no further than wishing to intro-duce a graduated income tax. The radical repub-
licans were not, in fact, in the least bit radical but
were ‘ﬁrmly attached to the principle of private
property’ and rejected ‘the idea of initiating classstruggles among our citizens’. Their reformingrecord down to 1914 was indeed meagre. Even
progressive income tax had to wait until 1917
before it became effective.Socialism developed late but rapidly in France.Jean Jaurès and the more orthodox Marxist, JulesGuesde, led the parliamentary party, which gained
103 deputies and 1 million votes in the elections
of 1914. But they never shared power with the
parties of the centre for two reasons: the Socialist
Party adhered to the line laid down in theInternational Socialist Congress of 1904 by refus-ing to cooperate in government with bourgeois
parties, and in any case it was excluded by all the
anti-socialist groups, which could unite on this
one common enmity.Besides the extreme left, the extreme right was also ranged against the Republic. From the
debris of the Dreyfus case there had emerged a
small group of writers led by Charles Maurras
who formed the Comité de l’Action Française.
Under the cloak of being a royalist movement,Maurras’s ideas were really typical of some aspectsof later fascism; fanatically anti-democratic and
anti-parliamentarian, he hated Protestants, Jews,
Freemasons and naturalised French people. An
aristocratic elite would rule the country anddestroy the socialism of the masses. The ActionFrançaise movement could not really appeal to
the masses with its openly elitist aims. Yet, it
appealed to a great variety of supporters. Pius Xsaw in the movement an ally against the godlessRepublic; its hatreds attracted the support of thedisgruntled, but it did not become a signiﬁcant
political movement before the war of 1914. The
Action Française movement enjoyed notoriety
through its daily paper of the same name, dis-tributed by uniformed toughs, the so-calledCamelots du roi; uninhibited by libel laws, thepaper outdid the rest of the press in slander.Far more signiﬁcant than right extremists wasthe revolutionary workers’ movement known as
syndicalism, which emerged during the early years of the twentieth century. The factory workerhad become a signiﬁcant and growing element 
of society between 1880 and 1914. The trade
unions, or syndicats, really got under way in the1890s. Unlike the parliamentary Socialists, thesyndicalists believed that the worker should haveno confidence in the parliamentary Republic,
which was permanently dominated ‘by the prop-
ertied’. The unions were brought together in the
Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT). By1906 the CGT ﬁrmly adhered to a programme ofdirect action, of creating the new state not
through parliament but by action directly affect-
ing society; its ultimate weapon, its members
believed, would be the general strike. They
accepted violence also as a justiﬁable means tobring about the ‘social revolution’. The attitudeof the CGT had much in common with the
British phase of revolutionary trade unionism 
in the 1830s. Although most workers did not 
join the syndicalist CGT – only some 7 per centin 1911 – nevertheless with 700,000 memberstheir impact was considerable; they organised 
frequent violent strikes which were then ruthlessly
put down by the army. The syndicalists declared
they would not ﬁght for the Republic and on 
27 July 1914 demonstrated against war. Social-ism, by being divided as a movement – for syn-dicalists rejected any community of interest with
parliamentary Socialists – was much weakened 
in France. The result was a deep alienation of a
large group of working men from the ThirdRepublic. The defence of the fatherland, thealmost unanimous patriotism in 1914 against the
common enemy, was to mask this alienation for
a time.1HEREDITARY FOES AND UNCERTAIN ALLIES25
The assertiveness of France in the wider worldstands in remarkable contrast to the conservatismof French society at home. The national humilia-
tion and defeat at German hands in the war of
1870–1 did not turn France in on itself, the grow-
ing disparity between French and German powerafter 1870, whether looked at in terms of popula-tion or industrial production, did not, as might be
expected, inhibit France’s efforts abroad.The choice confronting France towards theend of the nineteenth century was clear. A policy
of reconciliation and trust in imperial Germanycould have been followed. This would have beenbased on the fact that Germany had not exploited
its superior strength for twenty-ﬁve years to foist
another ruinous war on France. Alternatively,
France could follow a deterrent policy. Unableever to be strong enough to match Germanyalone, it could with the help of an ally contain it
by making the chances of success for Germany in
war much more hazardous. This was the policy
generally followed by the governments of theThird Republic after 1890. They ﬁrst sought analliance with tsarist Russia and, after its conclu-
sion in 1894, made its maintenance the bedrock
of French foreign policy. The alliance made it
possible for France to continue to conduct policy
as a great power despite its relative inferiority inpopulation and production. Reliance on goodrelations with Germany would have made it
dependent on Germany’s goodwill, a weaker and
in the end junior partner as long as relationships
were seen purely in terms of national power.The path to the alliance with Russia wassmoothed by the large loans raised on the Paris
money market which Russia needed for its indus-
trial and military development. From close on
3,000 million francs in 1890, they rose to 12,400
million francs in 1914, representing between athird and a quarter of the total of France’s foreigninvestments.The defensive military pacts concluded in 1892and 1894 survived all the strains of the French–
Russian relationship down to 1914. The Russiansafter all were not keen to risk a war with Germanyover France’s imperial ambitions and the French
did not want to become embroiled in war over
Russian Slav ambitions in the Balkans. At crucialmoments of tension support for each other washalf-hearted. Therefore, it made good sense toreach settlements with Britain in Africa and, more
than that, offer support against Germany. That
became the basis of the Anglo-French entente
concluded in 1904, never an alliance but, never-theless, an increasing British commitment overthe next ten years to assist France militarily if
threatened or attacked by Germany. Britain made
good its promises during the two Moroccan crises
of 1905 and 1911.The year 1912 was also critical in Frenchhistory. Raymond Poincaré, a tough nationalist,impeccable republican, orthodox anti-clerical and
conservative in social questions, became premier,
and subsequently president in 1913. Army appro-
priations were increased; even so in 1913 theFrench army of 540,000 would be facing aGerman army of 850,000 if war should break out
– a catastrophic prospect. To reduce this gap a
bill lengthening service in the French army from
two to three years became law in 1913. TheFrench Chamber had turned away from the leftSocialists, and the army became more respectable
in the eyes of the leading politicians in power, as
it had proved a valuable and reliable instrument
in crushing strikes and revolutionary syndicalism.
Poincaré was determined that France shouldnever find itself at the mercy of Germany. Astrong alliance with Russia became the most cher-
ished objective of his diplomacy. So he reversed
earlier French policy and assured the Russians in
1912 that they could count on French support iftheir Balkan policy led to conﬂict with Austria-Hungary; if Germany then supported its ally,
France would come to the aid of Russia. This was
a most signiﬁcant new interpretation and exten-
sion of the original Franco-Russian alliance of
1894; it ceased to be wholly defensive. Poincaréalso encouraged the Russians to reach navalagreements with the British.Against the growing power of Germany,Poincaré saw that France was faced with a grim
choice: either to abandon its status as a greatpower and to give in to German demands (themanner of their presentation had been amply
demonstrated during the Moroccan crisis of
1911) or to strengthen its own forces and draw as26SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
close as it could to its Russian ally (even at the riskof being sucked into war by purely Russian Balkaninterests) and to the British entente partner. In
staff conversations the Russians in 1912 agreed to
resume their offensive military role and to start
their attack on East Prussia on the ﬁfteenth day ofmobilisation. France had come through its yearsof ‘risk’ giving up very little. The other side of the
coin is that imperial Germany had not exploited its
military superiority during the years from 1905 to
1911 by launching a so-called ‘preventive’ war.The years from 1912 to 1914 marked a vitalchange. Fatalism about the inevitability of warwas spreading among those who controlled
policy, and ever larger armies were being trained
for this eventuality on all sides of the continent.
With Poincaré as France’s president, Russia wouldnot again be left in the lurch by its ally wheneverRussia judged its vital interest to be at stake in
the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire. But French
diplomacy conﬂicted increasingly with public sen-
timent. There was strong domestic opposition tostrengthening the army; foreign dangers, the leftbelieved, were being deliberately exaggerated by
the right. On the very eve of war in 1914, the
French elections gave the majority to the paciﬁst
groups of the left. But it was too late. Poincaré’s
support for Russia did not waver during thecritical ﬁnal days before the outbreak of war andwas a crucial factor in the decision the tsar and
his ministers took to mobilise, which made war
inevitable in 1914.ITALY: ASPIRATIONS TO POWERWhat happens when a parliamentary constitution
is imposed on an underdeveloped society? The
answer is not without relevance to conditions inthe Third World in the twentieth century. Italyprovides an interesting early case history. In pop-
ulation size Italy, Austria-Hungary, France and
Britain belong to the same group of larger
European nations, but the differences betweentheir development and power are striking. Thegreater part of Italy, especially the south, was in
the late nineteenth century among the poorest
and most backward regions of Europe. But itsrulers in the north imposed parliamentary consti-tutional government on the whole of Italy, overthe more developed as well as the undeveloped
regions. Furthermore, a highly centralised admin-
istration was devised dividing the whole country
into sixty-nine provinces, each governed by aprefect responsible to the minister of the interior.Parliamentary institutions suited well enoughthe north-western region of Italy, formerly the
kingdom of Piedmont, the most advanced region
of Italy, where parliamentary government had
taken root before uniﬁcation. The problem arosewhen the Piedmontese parliamentary system wasextended to the whole of Italy in 1861; it was now
intended to cover the very different traditions and
societies of the former city states, the papal
domains and the Neapolitan kingdom. It was aunity imposed from above. For many decades‘unity’ existed more on paper than in reality. 
Italy had the appearance of a Western European
parliamentary state.A closer look at the Italian parliament showshow very different it was from Britain’s. To beginwith, only a very small proportion, 2 per cent, of
Italians were granted the vote. This was gradually
extended until in 1912 manhood suffrage was
introduced. But in the intervening half-century,
the small electorate had led to the managementof parliament by government; a few strongmendominated successive administrations. There 
were no great political parties held together by
common principles and beliefs, just numerous
groups of deputies. The dominating nationalleaders contrived parliamentary majorities bystriking bargains with political groups, by bribes
of ofﬁce or by the promise of local beneﬁts. When
a government fell, the same leaders would strike
new bargains and achieve power by a slight
shufﬂing of political groupings.In such a set-up, parliamentary deputies cameto represent not so much parties as local interests;
their business was to secure beneﬁts for their elec-
tors. Politicians skilled in political deals dominated
the oligarchic parliamentary system from 1860 to1914. In the early twentieth century GiovanniGiolitti became the leading politician. These lead-
ers can be condemned for their undeniable polit-
ical corruption as well as for undermining the1HEREDITARY FOES AND UNCERTAIN ALLIES27
principles of constitutional parliamentary and,eventually, democratic government. The ordinaryvoter could scarcely be aroused in defence of par-
liament which seemed to assemble only for the
beneﬁt of politicians and special-interest groups.On the other hand, the particular conditionsof recently united Italy have to be taken intoaccount. It had a strong tradition of local loyal-
ties. Central government was regarded as an alien
force. The difﬁculty of building bridges between
the political oligarchy of those who ruled and the
mass of the people was great. Outside Piedmontthere was little tradition of constitutional parlia-mentary government of any sort. At the time of
uniﬁcation three-quarters of the population could
neither read nor write. The poverty of southern
and central Italy was in great contrast to theprogress of the north. And the enmity of thepapacy, which had lost its temporal dominion,
meant that Catholics obedient to the Pope were
alienated from the state and would not participate
in elections. In a country so rent by faction andregional rivalry as well as so backward, it can beargued that the ﬁrm establishment of unity and
the solid progress achieved represented, in them-
selves, a notable success. The franchise was
extended, and illiteracy greatly reduced so that by
1911 almost two-thirds of the population couldread and write; in the south the proportion ofliterate to illiterate was reversed.Politics cannot be divorced from society andpoverty. Compared to France and Britain, Italy
was a poor country; the greater part of Italy, espe-cially the south, was caught in the poverty trap ofa backward agrarian economy. A larger propor-
tion of the population remained dependent on
agriculture right down to the First World War
than in any other Western European country,
including France. Some agricultural progress wasachieved as landowners and peasants turned toexporting olive oil, fruit and wine, but protection
against the inﬂux of low-cost wheat from the
Americas beneﬁted principally the great landown-
ers of the south, while high food costs bore mostheavily on the poorest landless labourers. Themasses of the south were exploited in the inter-
ests of the north. Deforestation, exhaustion of the
soil and soil erosion, taxation and overpopulationforced some of the peasantry to emigrate in searchof a less harsh life elsewhere in Europe or acrossthe Atlantic. During every year of the 1890s, on
average 280,000 people left Italy, rather more
than half this number to go overseas; this human
stream rose to 600,000 a year in the ﬁrst decadeof the twentieth century and reached 873,000 in1913, by which time about two-thirds went over-
seas, principally to the US. No European state
suffered so great an exodus of its population in
the early twentieth century. By 1927, the Italian
government calculated there were more than 9million Italians living abroad, where they formedconcentrated communities: among them, half a
million in New York, 3.5 million in the US as a
whole, 1.5 million in the Argentine and 1.5
million in Brazil.The alliance between northern industry and thelarge, and frequently absentee, landowners grow-
ing wheat in the south impoverished the mass of
the peasantry: protected by a high tariff, these
landowners were able to farm large tracts of landinefﬁciently and wastefully without penalty; unlikein France, no class of peasant proprietors, each
with his own plot of land, would emerge. Almost
half the peasants had no land at all; many more
held land inadequate even for bare subsistence.By the turn of the century, there was a growingrecognition that there was a ‘southern question’and that the policies of united Italy had been
devised to suit the conditions of the north; special
state intervention would be necessary to help the
south. In December 1903 Giolitti, when primeminister, expressed the will of the government toact: ‘To raise the economic conditions of the
southern provinces is not only a political necessity,
but a national duty’, he declared in parliament.
Genuine efforts were made by legislation to stim-
ulate industrial development in the Naples region,to improve agriculture and reform taxation, buildrailways and roads, improve the supply of clean
water and, above all, to wage a successful cam-
paign against the scourge of malaria. But too little
was done to improve the wealth of the peasantsand to increase peasant proprietorship; the middleclass was small and, in the absence of industry,
mainly conﬁned to administration and the profes-
sions. Government help on the economic front28SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
was but a drop in the ocean of widespread povertyand backwardness. Despite the undoubted pro-gress, the gap between the north and south con-
tinued to widen. Little would be achieved until
after the Second World War, but even at the
beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century the problemof the south persists.Italian industrialisation was handicapped by thelack of those indigenous resources on which the
industrialisation of Britain, France and Germany
was based: the amount of coal in Italy was negli-
gible and there was little iron ore. But helped byprotection (since 1887), Italian industry devel-oped in the north. The ﬁrst decade of the twenti-
eth century was (apart from the brief depression of
1907 to 1908) a period of exceptionally fast
growth, overcoming the depression of the 1890s.Textile production, led by silk, rapidly expandedin Piedmont and Lombardy and dominated
exports. Large quantities of coal had to be
imported but as a source of energy coal was sup-
plemented by the exploitation of hydroelectricalpower, in which large sums were invested. Italyalso entered into the ‘steel age’, building up its
steel production to close on a million metric tons
by the eve of the First World War, a quantity ﬁvetimes as large as in the 1890s. A start was made,too, in promising new twentieth-century indus-tries in typewriters (Olivetti), cars (Fiat), bicycles
and motorcycles. A chemical industry producing
fertilisers rapidly developed. State aid, in the form
of special legislation aiding shipbuilding or bystimulating demand through railway constructionand through tariff protection, contributed to this
spurt of industrialisation in the early twentieth
century. The banks provided investment funds;
the help of tourist income and the money sent
back by Italians abroad enabled a greater invest-ment to be made than was earned by the industrialand agricultural production of the country.But a weakness of Italy’s industrialisation wasits concentration in three north-western regions,
Piedmont (Turin), Lombardy (Milan) and Liguria(Genoa), thus widening further the gap betweenadministrative political uniﬁcation and industrial
economic uniﬁcation.The growth of industry in the north led, aselsewhere in Europe, to new social tensions asfactory workers sought to better their lot orsimply to protest at conditions in the new indus-
trial centres. During the depression of 1897 and
1898, riots spread throughout Italy, culminating
in violence and strikes in Milan. They were met
by ﬁerce government repression. But the year1900 saw a new start, a much more promisingtrend towards conciliation. The Socialist Party
was prepared to collaborate with the Liberal par-
liamentarians and accept the monarchy and con-
stitution in order to achieve some measure ofpractical reform. This was the lesson they learnt1HEREDITARY FOES AND UNCERTAIN ALLIES29

from the failure of the recent violence in Milan.Giolitti, who became prime minister for thesecond time in 1903, saw the involvement of the
masses in politics as inevitable and so sought to
work with the new forces of socialism and to tame
them in political combinations. But he lookedbeyond this to genuine social and ﬁscal reforms.The rise of socialism in the 1890s had one ben-eﬁcial result for the embattled state. It alarmed the
Church and led to a revision of the papal interdic-
tion against such activities as participation in
government and parliamentary elections. Thetemporal rights of the Church – the ‘occupation’of Rome – were becoming a question of history
rather than one of practical politics. Pope Leo XIII
expressed the Church’s concern for the poor and
urged social reform as a better alternative torepressive conservativism on the one hand andatheistic socialism on the other. The Church was
coming to terms with twentieth-century society.
His successor, Pope Pius X, though more conser-
vative, in 1904 permitted Catholics to vote wher-ever Socialists might otherwise be elected. Thismarked the cautious beginning of collaboration
between Church and state, and a beginning, too,
in creating a Catholic political force (Christian
Democrat) to keep the Socialists out of power in
collaboration with other groups. Catholic supportwas welcome to Giolitti. His progressive socialviews did not mean he wished to allow Socialists a
decisive voice in government.From 1903 onwards the Socialists were splitinto violently hostile factions: a minority, thereformists, were still ready to collaborate withinthe constitutional framework and to work for
practical reform; the majority, the syndicalists,
were intent on class revolution to be achieved by
direct action and violence through syndicates or
trade unions. The weapon that they hoped wouldoverthrow capitalist society was the general strike.The split into reformist socialists, revolutionary
socialists and syndicalists further weakened the
Socialists, faced in the new century with the over-
whelmingly difficult task of changing a well-entrenched capitalist state. The great strikes of1904, 1907 and 1908 were defeated, the Socialist
Party in parliament was small, the forces of law
and order, strong; a Catholic labour movement,too, successfully diverted a minority of peasantsand industrial workers from socialist trade unions.The absence of strong parties and the com-manding position established by a few politicians
were the most noteworthy characteristics of Italian
political life before the First World War. TheCatholic political group was embryonic, unlikethose in neighbouring France and Germany.
Italian socialism could not overcome the handicap
of the ﬁerce factional struggles that characterised
the emergence of socialism in Europe. Regional-
ism, the Church and the backwardness of much ofthe country also prevented the development of abroadly based conservative party. So government
was dominated by the ‘liberal’ groupings of the
centre, agreeing only on the maintenance of law,
order and national unity, and bound by a commonopposition to conservative extremism and revolu-tionary socialism. Were these characteristics of
Italian political life the inevitable consequence of
this stage of uneven national development, of the
continuing regional particularism of a sharply dif-ferentiated society and of a limited franchise? Orshould the arrested form of parliamentary govern-
ment be regarded as forming the roots of the later
fascist dictatorship and the corporate state? It is
not helpful to look upon Giolitti as a precursor of
Benito Mussolini. The two men and their policiesmust be examined in the context of the conditionsof their own times. The shattering experience of
the First World War separated two eras of modern
Italian history, Giolitti’s from Mussolini’s.Giolitti was a politician of consummate skill inparliamentary bargaining. He followed broad andconsistent aims. The first was to master the
whirlpool of factions and to reconcile the broad
masses of workers and peasants with the state, to
accept the upsurge of mass involvement in politics
and industrial life and to channel it away fromrevolution to constructive cooperation. ‘Let noone delude himself that he can prevent the
popular classes from conquering their share of
political and economic inﬂuence’, he declared in
a remarkable parliamentary speech in 1901. Heclearly accepted the challenge and saw it as theprincipal task of those who ruled to ensure that
this great new force should be harnessed to con-
tribute to national prosperity and greatness. He30SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
was not prepared to accept revolutionary violence,yet repression, he recognised, would only lead tounnecessary bloodshed, create martyrs and alien-
ate the working man.Giolitti utilised the revulsion against the strikesof 1904 to increase his parliamentary support bycalling for a new election which he fought on amoderate platform. His tactics succeeded and he
never, down to 1914, lost the majority of support
he then gained. But this support was based as
much on the personal loyalty and dependence on
political favours of individual deputies as onagreement with any broad declaration of policy.His management of parliament (and the electoral
corruption) undeniably diminished its standing
and importance.Enjoying the support of King Victor EmmanuelIII, Giolitti’s power was virtually unfettered for adecade. He used it to administer the country efﬁ-

ciently, to provide the stability that enabled Italy,
in the favourable world economic conditions, to
make progress and modernise its industry. Hisconcern for the south was genuine, and state helppointed the way. In order to preserve the state,
Giolitti appeased the left and claimed to be a con-

servative. His most startling move towards the
politics of the masses, away from those of privilege,
was to introduce a bill in 1911 to extend the elec-
torate to all males. The bill became law in 1912. Itwas not so much the new extension of the fran-

chise that undermined Giolitti’s hold over his par-

liamentary majority: he secured the return of a
large majority in the new parliament of 1913.What transformed Italian politics was the unleash-
ing of ardent nationalism by the war with Turkey
in 1911 which Giolitti had started in quite a differ-

ent spirit of cool calculation.It was Italy’s misfortune to be diverted in thetwentieth century from the path of highly neces-sary internal development to a policy of national-
ism and aggressive imperialism. Italy lacked the
resources and strength for an expansionist foreign
policy. But for its own ambitions, Italy could haveremained as neutral as Switzerland.Italy was favoured by its geographical positionin that it did not lie in the path of the hostile
European states confronting each other. Luckilyfor Italy, its military forces represented to itsneighbours a ‘second front’ which they were mostanxious to avoid opening while facing their main
enemy elsewhere. However little love they had for
Italy, they were therefore anxious to preserve
Italian neutrality and even willing to purchase itsbenevolence with territorial rewards. Thus, thediplomatic tensions and divisions of Europe were
extraordinarily favourable to Italy’s security,
which its own military strength could not have
ensured.One of the most virulent forms of nationalismis that known as ‘irredentism’, the demand tobring within the nation areas outside the national
frontier inhabited by people speaking the same
language. There were two such regions adjoining
the northern Italian frontier: Trentino andTrieste. Both were retained by Austria-Hungaryafter the war with Italy in 1866. A third area, Nice
and Savoy, which had been ceded to France in
return for French help in the war of uniﬁcation,

also became the target of irredentist clamour.Besides this irredentism, Italian leaders alsowished to participate in the fever of European
imperialism. Surrounded on three sides by the sea,
Italians looked south across the Mediterranean to
the North Africa shore where lay the semi-
autonomous Turkish territories of Tunis andTripolis and perceived them as a natural area ofcolonial expansion. They saw to the west the
island of Corsica, now French, but once a depen-
dency of Genoa; to the east, across the Adriatic,
the Ottoman Empire was the weakening ruler ofheterogeneous Balkan peoples.National ‘egoism’ gave Italian policy theappearance of faithlessness and inconsistency. But
it would be facile to make the moral judgement
that Italian nationalism was either better or worse
than that of the other European powers. What canbe said with certainty is that it served Italian inter-
ests ill, but then it would have required vision and
statesmanship of the highest order to have resisted
the imperialist urge which swept over all the
European powers. The Italians had not distin-
guished themselves in imperial wars. They were theonly European country to be defeated by indigen-

ous African people, the Abyssinians in 1896, but
the Italians did not lose their appetite for empire.1HEREDITARY FOES AND UNCERTAIN ALLIES31
In October 1911 the Italians, after declaringwar on Turkey, landed troops in Tripoli. A monthlater Giolitti announced the annexation of Libya.
But the Turks refused to give in. The Italians now
escalated the war, attacking in April 1912 the
Dardanelles and occupying a number of Aegeanislands. By October 1912 the Turks had hadenough and the war ended.The consequences of the war were, however,far from over. As peace was signed, Montenegro,
Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece began a new war, the
ﬁrst Balkan war, attacking Turkey. Italy’s policycannot be said to have caused the Balkan wars butits success, and Turkey’s proven isolation, hadcertainly encouraged the Balkan states. Setting
the Balkans alight was the last thing Giolitti
wanted, yet that is what occurred. Just as serious
were the reactions at home. Giolitti desired onlylimited expansion, but a reversion to a cautiouspaciﬁc policy had been difﬁcult. The nationalists
thirsted for more colonies, more territory. And 
so it came about that Giolitti had unleashed a
political force more powerful than he could
control.32SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
At the height of its imperial greatness, there is dis-cernible in the Edwardian Britain of the earlytwentieth century a new mood of uncertainty,
even of apprehension about the future. Why
should this be so?British society had shown itself remarkably suc-cessful in adapting to new conditions broughtabout by the industrial revolution. The inevitablesocial changes were taking place without violence.
Britain had passed peacefully through some two
decades of difficult economic conditions. The
apprehensive mood was related more to its futurerole in the world. On the face of it the BritishEmpire was the most powerful in the world: the
navy ‘ruled the waves’; Britain’s wealth was
matched by no other European state; a war in
South Africa had been brought to a successful end
in 1902, though it had not enhanced Britain’smilitary reputation. Superﬁcially the Edwardianage was elegant and opulent, the king giving a
lead to fashionable society and doing little else,
despite the myth about his inﬂuence on affairs of
state. But it was obvious that in the years to comeBritain would face great changes.The effects of trade on British industry were widely discussed. It was argued that British
industrial management was not good enough. If
British industrialists did not wake up, authors ofbooks like Made in Germany (1896) and theAmerican Invaders (1902) warned, Britain wouldbe overtaken and become a second-rate industrial
power.People feared another depression and rightlysensed that British industry was lagging behindthat of the US and Germany. This can indeed be
seen in the comparative growth in value of man-
ufactured exports of the world’s three leading
industrial nations.Britain’s economic performance during theyears from 1900 to 1914 showed several weak-nesses. The ‘ﬁrst’ industrial revolution was spread-
ing to the less developed world. A textile industry
was being built up in Japan and India. But Britain
continued to rely on a few traditional industriessuch as cotton textiles, which for a time continuedto grow strongly because of worldwide demand.
The coal industry, employing more than a million
men in 1914, still dominated the world’s coal
export trade due to the fortunate fact that British
coal mines were close to the sea, making possiblecheap transportation to other parts of the world.Together with iron and steel, coal and textiles
accounted for the greater part of Britain’s exports.
After 1900 British exporters found increasing dif-
ﬁculty in competing with Germany and the US inthe developing industrial countries. At home, for-eign manufacturers invaded the British market.
The speed of the American and German growth of
production is very striking. This success was partly
due to the increasing disparity between Britain’s,Germany’s and America’s populations.The story these statistics told was one peoplefelt in their bones. Of course, it would be a
mistake to believe that Britain and its industry1Chapter 2THE BRITISH EMPIREPREMONITION OF DECLINEwere set on an inevitable course of rapid decline.There were successful ‘new’ industries of the
‘second’ industrial revolution, such as the chem-
ical and electrical industry. Britain was still, in
1914, immensely strong and wealthy because ofthe continuing expansion of its traditional textileindustry and large coal reserves, the world domin-
ance of its mercantile marine, its investment
income from overseas and the reputation of the
insurance and banking institutions that made the
city of London the ﬁnancial centre of the world.But there was already in 1900 a doubt as towhether Britain would move sufﬁciently fast in
changing conditions to maintain its leading
industrial place in the world.Then industrialists felt doubts about the con-tinuing cooperation of labour. The trade unionmovement had revealed a new militancy which
posed a threat to industrial peace. The movement
was no longer dominated by the skilled artisans
sharing the values of the Victorian middle class.
The new unions of the poor working men,formed in the last two decades of the nineteenthcentury, looked to the state for decisive support,
for a redistribution of wealth.The Labour political movement also emergedduring the last decade of the nineteenth century,though the ultimate break between ‘Liberal’ and‘Labour’ politics did not take place until after theFirst World War. In 1900 the trade union move-
ment became convinced that involvement in par-

liamentary politics was now necessary if the
working man was to improve his standard of life.
The Labour Representation Committee, embrac-
ing a broad alliance of socialist parties and tradeunions, was formed in 1900. In the election later
that year two Labour candidates succeeded in win-

ning seats in the House of Commons. The
founders of the Labour movement were practical
men who realised that in the foreseeable futureLabour members would be in a minority. Theyresolved accordingly that they would cooperate
with any party ready to help labour. In Britain, the
Labour Party was prepared to work within the par-

liamentary system, and turned its back on revolu-
tion and violence. In turn, it became accepted andenjoyed the same freedom as other political parties.The Conservatives, who were in power until theclose of 1905, followed cautious social-political
policies. A state system of primary and secondary
schools was introduced, partly because of the beliefthat it was their better educational provisions thatwere enabling America and Germany to overtake
Britain in industrial efﬁciency. When the Liberals

came to power in 1906 their attitude to social and
economic reforms was equally half-hearted, muchof the party still believing in self-help and a mini-
mum of state paternalism. The surprise of the new34SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14

* Including Ireland and Northern Ireland respectively.parliament of 1906 was the election of ﬁfty-three
Labour members, though that number owedmuch to an electoral arrangement with the Liber-

als. Among this Labour group were a few genuine
socialists, such as Keir Hardie and Ramsay Mac-

Donald, who had nothing in common with theLiberals; but other Labour members were lessinterested in socialism than in securing legislation
to beneﬁt the working men – for example, the
Trade Disputes Bill which protected union funds
from employers’ claims for compensation after
strikes.In 1908 Herbert Asquith succeeded to thepremiership. In the same year, one of the few
major reforms was introduced – old-age pensions,
which removed fear of the workhouse from the
aged. The famous budget of 1909, however,sparked off a political crisis. Introduced by theLiberal chancellor of the exchequer, David Lloyd
George, it increased indirect taxes on spirits and
tobacco – which was unpopular with the poor –
but also modestly increased the burdens on thebetter-off. The House of Lords – quite unjustly– sensed in these measures the thin edge of the
wedge that would destroy their privileges. The
Liberals pressed the issue of constitutional reform
as a means of reviving the party’s popularity in 
the country. The power of the Conservative-dominated House of Lords to veto bills passed by the Liberal majority in the Commons was 
to be curtailed so that within the life of one 
parliament, the House of Commons majority
would prevail.An impasse was reached in Britain’s politicallife, not dissimilar from that in imperial Germany
at about the same time. Should the Conservative
hereditary lords have the power to block even the
mild reforming legislation of an elected Liberal
majority? Unlike in Germany, the constitutionalturmoil was resolved. In November 1909 theHouse of Lords threw out the budget with the
intention of submitting the issue to the electorate.
This readiness by government and parliament to
accept the wishes of the people on the one hand,and the constitutional monarch’s acceptance ofthe same verdict (though George V did insist
unnecessarily on two elections) on the other, was
the essential difference between imperial Germanyand Britain. The Liberal tactic of taking the con-stitutional issue to the country misﬁred. They losttheir overall majority and now ran neck and neck
with the Conservatives. By the close of the second
election in December 1910, each party had 
precisely the same strength in the House ofCommons. But the Liberals, supported by Labourmembers and the Irish Nationalists, commanded a
substantial majority over the Conservatives. The
House of Lords in the summer of 1911 gave their
assent to the bill limiting their powers. No social
upheaval threatening the inﬂuence of wealth andproperty followed. But common sense, and arespect for the wishes of the majority of the House
of Commons on which parliamentary constitu-
tional government was based, prevailed. Britain
would continue to follow the political and socialpath of evolution, not revolution.A National Insurance Bill of 1911 coveredmost workers against ill health, but only those in
the cyclical building and engineering trades
against unemployment. What Liberal policies did not do was to satisfy the working man whoresented paying (with employers) compulsorily
for national insurance and whose real wage in the
recent years had not risen. The years 1911 and
1912 witnessed an unprecedented number of
strikes and an increase in the power of the tradeunions. The Liberal Party did not win the supportof organised industrial labour. Nor did it seize the
chance to earn the gratitude of potential women
voters by granting their enfranchisement. The
Liberals, for all Lloyd George’s dash and clamouras chancellor of the exchequer, were simply notready to embark on bold social policies.The majority of Britain’s leaders believed that thefuture safety and prosperity of Britain depended
on revitalising and drawing together the strengthof the empire. Only in this way, they thought,could Britain hope to face the other great powers
on an equal footing. But the questions were also
asked: Will the empire last? Does it rest on per-
manent foundations or is it only a political organ-ism in a certain state of decomposition? Will theyounger nations, as they grow to maturity, be
content to remain within it, or will they go the
way of the American colonies before them ...?
1THE BRITISH EMPIRE35
The 400 million people of the British Empirehad reached different stages of advancement toindependence by the close of the nineteenth cen-
tury. The division of the empire was largely on
racial lines. The white people of the empire, where
they predominated or even formed a signiﬁcantminority of the country, were granted ‘self-government’, only a step short of total independ-
ence. In practice, ‘self-government’ was brought
about by applying the pattern of British parlia-
mentary government to these countries; this,
together with a federal structure, created theDominions: Canada in 1867, New Zealand in1876, the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901
and, in 1909, seven years after the conclusion of
the bitter Boer War, the Union of South Africa.
The responsibility to protect the ‘native’ inhabi-tants of lands conquered and colonised by Euro-peans was recognised by Britain. But little that was
effective was done by the imperial government 
in London. Indians in Canada, Maoris in New
Zealand and Aborigines in Australia were largelyleft to struggle alone for their rights. In southernAfrica, the black Africans formed the majority of
the inhabitants but democratic rights were denied
them and they were left to the control of the white
peoples. British governments in London were not
prepared to jeopardise their relations with thewhite ruling inhabitants. Racial discrimination wasa grievous ﬂaw in the British Empire, though a
paternalistic concern for the ‘natives’ was perfectly
genuine. Those parts of the empire not granted
self-government were controlled and ruled in abewildering variety of ways, more the result ofaccident than design, as Crown colonies (in the
Caribbean and West Africa, for instance) or indi-
rectly through local rulers – as, originally, in the
Indian states, and later in the Malay states and the
protectorates of tropical Africa. Of these ‘realms intrust’ the most populous and extensive was India.Ruled by British viceroys under the Crown as a
separate empire, some 300 million Indians were
Britain’s responsibility from 1858 until 1947.In 1900, a British Empire that did not includeIndia would have seemed as unlikely as Londonwithout the Tower. But already the voice of India
had been heard calling for autonomy and inde-
pendence. In 1885 the first Indian NationalCongress had met. Those who gathered repre-sented the Western viewpoint and admired theBritish. But rule by the British was seen as alien
rule, and independence through the stage of
Dominion status as an achievable goal for the
future. The British brought unity, external andinternal peace to India, and with the active co-operation of those Indians who had traditionally
ruled the various states, established an incompara-
ble administration all over the subcontinent. It
was made possible by the marriage of Anglo-
Indian traditions. But India was exploited too.Little was done for the masses of the poor.Economically, India was a dependency of Britain.
The splendour of the British Raj never stilled
British doubts about their role, so strongly rein-
forced by the Indian mutiny of 1857; the Britishwere conscious that they, a mere handful of aliens,were ruling over millions of people. Would the
people always so consent? In 1905 a senior mem-
ber of the British ruling caste of India summed up
the general view held by those responsible forBritish policy in India: British rule, he wrote,rested on ‘its character for justice, toleration and
careful consideration of native feeling’, but it was
also based on bayonets, on the maintenance of an
‘adequate’ force of British soldiers in India and the
absolute command of the sea. If Britain weakened,its domination of India would come to an endthrough an uprising, perhaps helped along by a
hostile foreign power, in all probability Russia.
That was regarded as the ultimate disaster.The dynamic colonial secretary, JosephChamberlain, was the principal advocate of animperial movement for greater unity. In his great
‘tariff reform’ campaign from 1903 to 1905 he
sought to win British support for a protected and
preferential empire market which he believed
would cement imperial relationships; but, as itwould also have entailed higher food prices forthe British people, he failed to carry the whole
country. In a different way, the attempt to create
a more uniﬁed system of imperial defence also
failed; the self-governing Dominions were notwilling to give up their independence. The causeof imperial unity was destined to fail. But in the
era from 1900 to 1945, the British Empire
remained very much a reality, as the prodigious36SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
effort in two world wars was to show. Coopera-tion between the Dominions and the mothercountry, however, was voluntary, based on a
variety of changing institutions devised to meet
no more than immediate needs.The most striking aspect of Britain’s world pos-ition in 1900 was the contrast between the
appearance of its world power and its reality.
Anyone looking at a map of the world with the
British Empire painted red might well think that
Britain dominated the world. This was certainlynot the case.The security of the British Isles and the empirecame to depend on three circumstances: in North
America on peaceful good relations; in eastern
Asia on the assistance of an ally; in Europe on acontinued ‘balance of power’ between the greatcontinental nations.Even with the largest navy, Britain could notcontinue relying entirely on its own strength and
on temporary allies whose own interests happenedto coincide with Britain’s at any particularmoment of crisis. There was a widespread feeling
that Britain was over-committed and that some
change of course in its foreign relations would be
essential. There were those who favoured an
alliance with Germany. But the Germans provedcoy. They saw no advantage in helping Britainagainst Russia, except perhaps if Britain were to
pay the price of sharing its empire with Germany.
An alliance was never really on the cards and dis-
cussions about such a possibility ceased in 1902.Others thought the sensible course for Britainwould be to reduce the number of potential
opponents all over the world. A successful start
was made by removing all possibility of conﬂict
with the US. On the British side, the readiness to
defend British interests in the Americas by force,against the US if necessary, was abandoned earlyin the twentieth century. The British government
signiﬁed its willingness to trust the US by allow-
ing the Americans control of the future Panama
Canal, by withdrawing the British fleet from the Caribbean, and by leaving the Dominion ofCanada, in practice, undefended. On the US’s
side the idea that the absorption of Canada was
part of the US’s manifest destiny faded.Britain liquidated with equal success the long-drawn-out imperial rivalry with France in manyparts of the world. As late as 1898 it had seemed
possible that Britain and France would be at war
again, as they had been in the early nineteenth
century. There was very little love for Britain inFrance, where Britain was most bitterly con-demned during the South African War. But the
French government made its prime objective the
control of Morocco. In April 1904 Britain and
France settled their imperial differences, France
promised Britain support in Egypt and Britainwould support the French in Morocco. From thismutual pact grew the French entente cordiale
when Germany ﬂexed its muscles in the Moroccan
crisis of 1905 and 1911, objecting to being left
out of the carve-up. Over the next three years theLiberal government found itself enmeshed in a‘moral’ alliance with military promises, but not in
a treaty by which the French could automatically
require Britain to join it in a war with Germany.Britain’s attempt to reach a settlement with itsmost formidable opponent in the world arena,Russia, was far less successful. Russia’s occupation
of Manchuria in China, which began in 1900,
alarmed the British government. The China
market was seen as vital to Britain’s future pros-
perity. Unable to check Russia, or to trust it,Britain concluded an alliance with Japan in 1902.This alliance marks a signiﬁcant stage in thehistory of Western imperialism. In the division of
empire the European powers had been locked in
rivalry and confrontation one against the other,though this rivalry had not led to war betweenthem since the mid-nineteenth century. It was the
Africans and Chinese, the peoples whose lands
were parcelled up, who had suffered the ravages
of war. The Europeans, though ﬁercely competi-
tive among themselves, acted in this their lastphase of expanding imperialism on the commonassumption that it was their destiny to impose
European dominion on other peoples. Now, for
the ﬁrst time in the new century, a European
power had allied with an Asiatic power, Japan,against another European power, Russia.In the Middle East Britain was determined todefend against Russia those territorial interests
which, in 1900, before the age of oil had properly1THE BRITISH EMPIRE37
begun, were largely strategic: the road to Indiawhich ran through the Ottoman Empire, Persiaand landlocked mountainous Afghanistan. India
was the greatest possession and jewel of the British
Empire and tsarist Russia was credited by the
British with the ultimate desire of ousting Britainfrom India and of seeking to replace Britain as theparamount power of southern Asia. The defence
of India and Britain’s own supremacy in southern
Asia had been the foremost objective of British
policy in the nineteenth century and remained so
in the new century.But it became increasingly difﬁcult to defendthe ‘buffer states’ which kept Russia away from
the classic land-invasion route to India. The
Ottoman Empire, once dominated by British
influence, had turned away from Britain. NoBritish government could easily have come to thedefence of an empire which, under the Sultan
Abdul Hamid, ‘the Damned’, had murdered
defenceless Christian Armenians in Asia Minor. In
Persia, Russia’s inﬂuence was steadily advancing.In 1904 a dramatic change occurred. Russiabecame embroiled in war with Japan over China.
Its military weakness became apparent to the
world. Tsarist Russia desperately needed years of
peace after 1905 to recover. The British foreign
secretary, Sir Edward Grey, therefore found theRussians more ready in 1907 to reach an agree-
ment with Britain to partition their imperial
spheres of interests in the Middle East. But Grey
believed this agreement only provided a temporary
respite.British security in Europe had been based onan effective balance of power on the continent. It
had been a part of Britain’s traditional policy to
seek to prevent any one power gaining the
mastery of continental Europe. After the defeat of
Napoleon there seemed to be no serious possi-bility that any single nation either harboured suchambitions or could carry them through. But
around 1905 doubts began to arise as to whether
this fundamental condition of safety might not be
passing. Germany’s ambitious plans of navalexpansion were being seriously noted. Germany’saggressive reaction in 1905 to the Anglo-French
deal over Morocco aroused graver fears that
Germany might be contemplating another waragainst France. Britain gave unhesitating supportto France. From 1905 to 1914 the golden threadof British policy was to endeavour to preserve the
peace, but in any case to avoid the possibility of
a German hegemony of the continent which
would result from a German victory over muchweaker France.Accordingly, on the one hand British policytowards Germany was paciﬁc and the prospect of
helping it achieve some of its imperial ambitions
was held out to it as long as it kept the peace. But
it was warned that should it choose to attackFrance in a bid for continental hegemony, it couldnot count on the British standing aside even if
Britain were not directly attacked. The Liberal
Cabinet from 1906 to 1914 was not united, how-
ever, though Grey’s policy of growing intimacywith France in the end prevailed. Several Liberalministers were more anti-Russian than anti-
German; strongly paciﬁc, they saw no cause for
war with Germany or anyone. Grey went his own
way of constructing a barrier against the threat ofGermany, supported by the two prime ministers ofthe period, Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith,
and a small group of ministers. In secret discus-
sions between the French and British military
staffs, military plans were drawn up after the sec-
ond Moroccan crisis of 1911 to land a Britisharmy of 150,000 men in France if Germanyinvaded France. At the same time Grey continued
to emphasise that the French should place no
reliance on Britain as there could be no formal
alliance between the two countries. It was a curi-ous policy dictated partly by differences among hisministerial colleagues and partly by Grey’s own
desire to play a mediating role in present and
future conﬂicts. In fact, this compromise between
‘alliance’ and the ‘free hand’ worked quite well
down to the outbreak of war in 1914. Grey madea notable contribution to calming Europe duringthe Bosnian crisis of 1909 and in collaborating
with Germany during the Balkan wars in 1912 and
1913 in order to help preserve European peace.Nevertheless, alarm at Germany’s intentionsgrew in Britain from 1910 onwards. In the publicmind this had much to do with the expansion 
of the German navy. Efforts to moderate the 
pace – the war secretary, Richard Haldane, visited38SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
Berlin for this purpose early in 1912 and WinstonChurchill, ﬁrst lord of the admiralty, called for a ‘naval holiday’ in 1913 – all came to nothing.
The German ministers, in return, had demanded
that Britain should tie its hands in advance and
promise to remain neutral if Germany went to warwith France. The Germans continued to bewarned that Britain, in its own interests, would
stand by France if France found itself attacked 
by the numerically superior German military
machine. This threat, rather than Germany’s naval
challenge, motivated British policy. As Grey putit in 1912, Britain was in no danger of beinginvolved in a war ‘unless there is some Power, 
or group of Powers in Europe which has the
ambition of achieving ... the Napoleonic policy’.
The British government knew that it possessedthe resources to keep pace with any increase inGermany’s naval construction. By 1914 Britain
had twenty new super-battleships of the dread-
nought class, against Germany’s thirteen; in older
battleships Britain’s superiority was even greater –twenty-six to Germany’s twelve. By makingarrangements with France to concentrate this ﬂeet
in home waters, leaving the Mediterranean to be
defended by the French ﬂeet, British naval superi-
ority over Germany was assured and, also signiﬁ-
cantly, its ties with France were strengthened.Still trying at the same time to assure Germanyof Britain’s general goodwill, Grey concluded two
agreements with it in 1913 and 1914. The ﬁrst,
a rather dubious one, divided up two Portuguese
colonies in Africa, Mozambique and Angola,allowing Germany a good share should Portugalchoose to dispose of these possessions. The other
agreement helped Germany to realise plans for
the ﬁnal sections of the Berlin–Baghdad railway
project and so facilitated German commercial
penetration of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia. Itwas concluded on the very eve of the outbreak ofwar in Europe.Grey endeavoured to steer a difﬁcult middlepath. He had met the Russian threat by the agree-
ments of 1907, just as his predecessor in theForeign Ofﬁce, Lord Lansdowne, had removedthe imperial rivalry with France in 1904 by a
general settlement. But the British never thought
that agreements with Russia, unlike the Frenchsettlement, would allow more than breathingspace from its inexorable pressure. Yet, in everyone of these agreements made to protect Britain’s
empire there was a price which the British
Cabinet would have preferred not to pay. To
protect its enormous stake in China, Britain hadconcluded the alliance with Japan in 1902 sanc-tioning Japanese aggression in Korea and making
war in eastern Asia with Russia more likely. After
Japan’s victory in 1904–5, Japan was set on the
road to dominate China. Then there was the
agreement with France over Morocco and Egyptin 1904, which was bound to offend Germany.Britain would have preferred to appease Germany
by allowing it a share of Morocco. The French
would not allow that. So Britain once more
gained its imperial objective – predominance inEgypt – at the cost of increasing tensions inEurope. The most striking example of Britain
protecting its empire at the cost of international
tension was the settlement reached with Russia.
With the conclusion of this agreement withRussia in 1907 over spheres of inﬂuence in theMiddle East, Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign
secretary, well understood that the Germans
would increasingly feel ‘encircled’.The question that has to be asked is why, ifRussia continued to be considered even after1907 to present the main threat to the heart ofthe British Empire in Asia, did Britain go to war
with Germany in 1914? There were no direct
Anglo-German territorial disputes or differences
over spheres of inﬂuence that were not capable ofsettlement. It is not easy to answer that questionbut there are clues in what Grey wrote and said.
Agreement with Russia rather than enmity
bought time. Then, looking to the future, how
could Britain best maintain its position as a great
power in Europe? It certainly wanted the peaceof Europe to be maintained. But Grey feared thatBritain might be faced with too powerful a com-
bination of countries in Europe in coalition
against it. However, he also repeatedly warned
against Britain becoming dependent on Germany.Britain’s distrust of Germany was certainlygrowing in the Edwardian period. The kaiser was
regarded as over-emotional and unstable. German
manufacturers were competing with the British in1THE BRITISH EMPIRE39
the world. Of course, Germany was an excellentmarket for British goods, something that wastaken for granted. Above all, the German naval
build-up touched the public to the quick. As Sir
Eyre Crowe, a senior member of the Foreign
Ofﬁce, put it in 1907, a hostile Germany was dis-regarding the ‘elementary rules of straightforwardand honourable dealing’ and Britain would have
to defend its position in the world, its naval
supremacy and the European balance of power.
Still, there were others who deplored the Ger-
manophobia, among them the bankers, industri-alists, politicians and many ordinary people whopreferred the ‘clean’ Germans to their French and
Italian neighbours with their supposedly more
dubious morals and awful lavatories. Tsarist auto-
cratic Russia, with its record of abusing humanrights, was regarded as the one European countrythat not only threatened Britain in Asia but least
shared British democratic ideals and respect for
human rights.Grey did not share the Germanophobia, but hebelieved it essential to preserve and strengthen theentente with France as the primary objective of
British policy in Europe. He hoped to gain some
inﬂuence over French policy in return for support-
ing France against unreasonable German behav-
iour. He could not hope to exercise such inﬂuenceover German policy. As it turned out he couldexercise little inﬂuence over the French either. But
it was the bedrock of Grey’s policy that friendly
relations with Germany should never be estab-
lished at the expense of France. In the end itmeant that Britain was more inﬂuenced by Frenchobjectives than the other way around. To please
the French and Russians in 1914, for instance,
Grey consented to Anglo-Russian naval conversa-
tions which unnecessarily but dramatically
increased German fears of encirclement. On theeve of 1914 the well-informed Grey perceptivelyassessed German apprehensions:The truth is that whereas formerly the GermanGovernment had aggressive intentions ... they
are now genuinely alarmed at the militarypreparation in Russia, the prospective increasein her military forces and particularly at theintended construction at the instance of the
French Government and with French money
of strategic railways to converge on the
German Frontier.Yet for all these insights, when the crisis came inJuly 1914, Grey’s mediating efforts, limited as they
were by previous constraints, proved unavailing.On the eve of the Great War, the most seriousproblem facing the British government seemed tobe not abroad but at home: the question of main-taining the unity of the United Kingdom. Ireland
was Britain’s Achilles heel. British governments
had been too slow in attempting to satisfy Irish
national feeling by devolution or limited ‘homerule’. Ireland’s problems had been allowed tolanguish until after the elections of December
1910. Now the decline of the Liberals’ fortunes
forced Asquith into more active collaboration
with the Irish Nationalist Party in the House ofCommons. Not for the ﬁrst time the Irish heldthe parliamentary balance of power. The Liberals
with the support of the Irish Nationalists had
staked their future on reforming the House of
Lords. Asquith, in return, was committed to
home rule for Ireland. In April 1912 he intro-duced the Home Rule Bill in the Commons.Ulster Protestant militants, strong in the north of
Ireland, were determined to kill the bill or at least
to demand partition. Sinn Féin, the Irish repub-
lican movement, was equally determined to pre-serve a united Ireland. Both sides raised privatearmies which on the eve of the Great War in 1914
threatened to plunge a part of the United
Kingdom into civil war. The outbreak of the war
gave Asquith the opportunity of postponing the
Irish confrontation. What with suffragettes resort-ing to spectacular demonstrations to gain the votefor women, industrial unrest, Ireland seemingly
on the brink of civil war, Britain presented a
picture of disarray. It was deceptive. A united
Britain and its empire entered the Great War of1914.40SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
The First World War doomed the efforts of thesetwo empires to reform their institutions, mod-
ernise and solve tensions within. The outcome of
war was revolution not evolution. For half acentury their rivalry and conﬂicts in the Balkancauldron had, at times by a narrow margin, been
adjusted without resort to force until the break-
down of 1914. The circle of conﬂict in this one
region of Europe then spread to engulf the whole
continent.As the world entered the twentieth century therewas a big question mark over the largest Western
state, the Russian Empire. The total size of
Russia’s population remained ahead of the US.But in industrial development Russia laggedbehind the Western world. It was what would 
be termed today a vast underdeveloped country,
stretching from the European frontiers with
Germany and Austria-Hungary through the
Middle East and Asia to the shores of the PaciﬁcOcean. The only nation larger than Russia wasChina, which in 1900 seemed on the verge of dis-
integration. Would Russia also disintegrate in the
new century? Would revolution sweep away the
Romanov dynasty, or would Russian autocracyprevail and continue to send the largest army inthe world to conquer more and more territory
and continue to incorporate more and more
nationalities into the Russian Empire? Russia pos-
sessed all the resources of iron and coal to turn itinto a major industrial power. How would itsneighbours be able to resist Russian expansion asit modernised?Russia’s potential threat to the interests andsecurity of the countries surrounding it hung overthem all, and increased in proportion to the actualgrowth of Russian power in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries.By 1914 around 100 distinct national peopleshad been incorporated into Russia. This made it
the largest and most varied multinational empire.Government was highly centralised and absoluteloyalty to the tsar was demanded of every national
group. The predominant Russian people, the
largest single population group by far, believed in
the superiority of their culture, their orthodoxform of Christianity and the superiority of Slavs.The tsar sought to impose Russiﬁcation on the
other peoples and to suppress other religions. The
Orthodox Church also formed a pillar of the tsar’s
autocracy and justiﬁed it as ordained by God. The
most persistently persecuted minority were theJews, who were deliberately made scapegoats forthe ills besetting Russia. Anti-Semitism and dis-
crimination, and even persecution of Jews, were1Chapter 3THE LAST DECADES OF THEMULTINATIONAL RUSSIAN AND

endemic throughout Europe, but most virulent inRussia. Liberal and progressive European opinionwas shocked and offended by the tsarist regime’s
treatment of the Jews.It is difﬁcult to look objectively at the historyof Russia during the period of the last tsar’s rule,1894 to 1917, knowing what followed. Was thedevelopment of Russia in the reign of Nicholas II
a kind of blind alley bound to lead to collapse and
revolution and the triumph of the Bolsheviks, or
was it already on the road to reform and change
before the outbreak of the First World War? Anafﬁrmative answer to the question of fundamen-tal change can most conﬁdently be given when
industrialisation is considered. Rapid acceleration
in the growth of the Russian economy began
some forty years later than in the US. Growth wasuneven during the period 1890 to 1914, rapid inthe 1890s when it more than doubled, was
checked by a serious depression during the early
years of the twentieth century, then from 1910
onwards resumed rapid expansion until the war.Not before 1928 would the Soviet Union againreach that level of production and so recover from
war, revolution and civil war. Industrialisation was
purposefully promoted by the state and master-
minded in the 1890s by Sergei Witte, the minis-
ter of ﬁnance. He recognised that to maintain its status as a great power, Russia must break with past traditions and catch up with its rapidly
industrialising European neighbours. A protective
tariff (1891), a stable currency linked to gold, and
high interest rates attracted massive foreigncapital, especially from France, and encouragedcapital formation in Russia. The expansion of rail-
ways had a widespread and stimulating effect on
industrial growth. Besides the small workshops,which in 1915 still employed two-thirds of allthose employed in industry, there had also devel-oped large-scale and modern industry. The statis-
tics set out in the table below give some
indication of Russian economic growth.It must also be remembered that populationgrowth was very rapid during these years so thatthe increase calculated per head of population was
much less impressive. But because Russia was so
large, its total production ranked it in world terms
by 1913 the ﬁfth industrial power after the US,
Germany, Great Britain and France.In 1913, in comparison with the US, Russiastill lagged far behind. It was also behind 
Germany and Britain, but Russian output became
comparable to that of France and Austria-
Hungary in a number of leading industries. Witha population four times as large as that of France,Russia only achieved roughly the same total
industrial production. All these ﬁgures on the one
hand show Russia’s great progress since 1890
compared with earlier decades, while on the otherhand they reveal that in comparison with the US,Germany and Britain, it remained backward and
the gap was still wide.Even in 1914 Russian society remained over-whelmingly rural. Precise classiﬁcation is extre-
mely difﬁcult as many workers in factories retainedtheir ties with their village and returned seasonallyat harvest time. But not less than 50 per cent of
the population were peasants, or muzhiki, who leda hard life, close to subsistence and dependent on
weather and harvests. Religion was their solacebut was less a reasoned Christianity than ritual andsuperstition. More than half the peasantry were
illiterate. Oppressed, the muzhikisymbolised theRussian masses revering the tsar as father and42SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14

autocrat, yet, when driven by hunger and depriva-tion, resorting to violence and destruction. Thosepeasants recently forced by destitution into the
crowded tenements or factory barracks of St
Petersburg and other industrial centres to work,
even lived separated from their families. At theheart of the problem of a Russia seeking to mod-ernise and move into the twentieth century lay this
vast peasantry. It was mainly on their heads too
that the burden of industrialisation had to be
placed, because they provided a cheap labour force
and generated the necessary surplus of wealthwhich made investment in new and expandingindustries possible. Exports of agricultural pro-
duce had to provide the greater part of capital to
pay for all that the state spent on the huge army,
on administration and on industry. In the earlytwentieth century the heavily burdened peasantrywas ripe for large-scale violent protests. In town
and country sporadic violence was to turn into the
explosion of 1905.The year 1905 marks a turning point in thehistory of Russia. The peasantry looted and burnt
the countryside and appropriated the landlords’
land. The immediate reason was the loss of
authority suffered by the tsarist autocracy during
the Russo-Japanese War. Violence also ﬂared inSt Petersburg and the towns. The defeat of theRussian armies in China and the despatch of 
the Russian ﬂeet to the bottom of the ocean 
by the Japanese at the battle of Tsushima in May
1905 weakened the hold of the autocratic tsarand his ministers.The capital, St Petersburg, became the sceneof violence and brutal repression. It was the enig-
matic leadership of a charismatic priest, Father
Georgei Gapon, who had initially worked for the
tsarist regime, that led to bloodshed. As tradeunions were forbidden in Russia the tsaristauthorities developed an ingenious scheme to
provide a safety valve for industrial grievances and
a link with the government workers. Associations,
carefully guided in their loyalty to the tsar and ledby reliable supporters of autocracy were pro-moted. One of these associations, formed with
the blessings of the Ministry of the Interior, was
Gapon’s in St Petersburg. Gapon proved anunreliable supporter. He organised a mass strikeand in January 1905 the whole of industrial StPetersburg was shut down by strikes. On what
became known as Bloody Sunday, 22 January, he
led to the Winter Palace a huge demonstration of
workers, their wives and children, perhaps asmany as 200,000 in all, dressed in their Sundaybest, to seek redress of their grievances from the
tsar. At the Narva Gate the head of the proces-
sion was met by Cossacks, who charged with
drawn sabres at the masses before them, maiming
and killing indiscriminately; soldiers ﬁred into thecrowd. Killing continued all morning. Severalhundred, possibly as many as 1,000, innocent
people perished. The spell of a beneﬁcent tsar was
broken. The tsar would never entirely recover his
authority or the faith and veneration of the masseswho had seen him as their ‘little father’.Throughout the borderlands – Poland, theBaltic, Finland and the Caucasus – there followed
widespread unrest and insurrection. To the 
earlier victims of assassination now, in February1905, was added another illustrious victim, theGrand Duke Sergei, the tsar’s uncle. Terrorism,
strikes, student agitation and a rioting peasantry,
together with the defeated and demoralised army
and navy, added up to a picture of Russian autoc-
racy in complete disarray. The prospect of disaf-fected armed forces on which autocracy relied wasa spectre reinforced in June 1905 by the cele-
brated mutiny of the battleship Potemkin inOdessa harbour. Russian autocracy had reached a
critical point: the tsar could go on shooting andfollow a policy of harsh repression or seek tomaster the situation by some timely concession
and reform. He chose the latter, though at heart
he remained a convinced, unbending autocrat.Yet, from the low point of his reign in 1905to the outbreak of the war nine years later the tsarmanaged better than many would have foretoldat the outset. For a short while he placed the able
Sergei Witte in charge of the immediate crisis.
Witte had a true, if cynical appreciation of the
problem of governing the empire. ‘The worldshould be surprised that we have any governmentin Russia, not that we have an imperfect govern-
ment’, he remarked in July 1905. Witte was con-
vinced that chaos would follow if the tsar’s rule1MULTINATIONAL RUSSIAN AND HABSBURG EMPIRES43
was allowed to fail; the nationalities and the con-ﬂict of classes would tear Russia apart. Autocracywas the only answer to lawlessness and dissolu-
tion. Faced with so much popular opposition,
Witte saw clearly enough that the tsar must either
now resort to repression far more bloody than anythat had preceded or put himself at the head ofthe ‘reform’ movement and limit its scope. Above
all the tsar must stop drifting in a sea of indeci-
sion. Witte’s personal inclination was for the
maintenance of undiluted autocracy but he recog-
nised that this was not likely to succeed, and thetsar had neither the nerve nor the stomach fortotal repression. The tsar gave way to those who
argued that a form of constitutionalism should be
introduced. A renewed wave of strikes in October
overcame his ﬁnal resistance. The outcome wasthe October Manifesto of 1905.In the previous February, Nicholas had declaredthat he would call into being a consultative assem-

bly, to be known as the Duma. In August the 
complicated method of election was announcedwhich allowed as little inﬂuence as possible to the 
disaffected workers. Now the October Manifesto
promised to bring to life a genuinely parliamentary
body with whom the tsar would share power. No
law would be promulgated without the consent of
the Duma.These promises made no impression on theworkers who had spontaneously formed them-
selves into soviets, or workers’ councils. In St
Petersburg and Moscow they openly called on the
army to come to the side of the revolutionarymovement. But the loyalty of the army to the tsarwas never seriously in doubt, the soviets were dis-
persed, their leaders arrested, and gradually during
1906 in town and country the tide of revolution
passed.With the need for compromise pressing, thetsar soon showed his true colours. There werefour meetings of the parliamentary assembly: the
Duma of 1906, the second Duma of 1907, the
third from 1907 to 1912, and the last from 1912
to 1917. In the ﬁrst Duma, a new party emerged,the Constitutional Democratic Party, or Kadets asthey were known. They were moderate and liberal
and hoped on the basis of the October Manifesto
to transform Russian autocracy into a genuineWestern parliamentary constitutional govern-ment. Together with the moderate left, they out-numbered the revolutionary socialists, who had
mostly boycotted the Duma, and the ultra-
conservatives. But the tsar would have nothing 
to do with a constitutional party or their leaderPavel Miliukov. After the short second Duma,which saw a strengthening of revolutionary social-
ists, the tsar simply changed the electoral rules,
ensuring tame conservative majorities in the third
and fourth Dumas.The opportunity of transforming Russia into agenuinely constitutional state by collaboratingwith moderate liberal opinion was spurned by the
tsar. As long as Nicholas II reigned, genuine con-
stitutional change on the Western model was
blocked. In 1917 the liberals as well as autocracywould be swept away by the forces of revolution.Yet, before the war the actual hold of the various
revolutionary socialist parties over the urban
workers and the peasants was tenuous. Therein
lies the extent of the lost opportunity to mod-ernise and transform Russia while avoiding theterrible violence which after 1917 accompanied
that process.Despite the undoubted political repression andreactionary policies of the tsar and his ministers,
there was also a genuine effort made to tacklesome of Russia’s basic problems and so to cut theground from under the widespread discontent. In
1906 the tsar entrusted power to a ruthless but
able man, Peter Stolypin, as chairman of the
Council of Ministers, a position he held until hisassassination in 1911. Stolypin lived up to his rep-utation as a ‘strongman’, and through draconian
measures such as military court martials executed
hundreds and smothered revolutionaryagitation.

There were also, of course, revolutionary attacks
on government ofﬁcials whose victims equally raninto many hundreds killed and wounded. Stolypinlaunched a war on terrorism. He suppressed the
rights of the nationalists; the Jews again particu-
larly suffered, associated as they were in the tsar’s
mind with sedition and socialism.It took no great discernment to recognise thatsomething needed to be done to help the peas-
antry. In November 1905 the peasants’ redemp-
tion payments for the land they farmed were44SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
cancelled (as from 1907). This made it possiblefor a peasant to become the legal proprietor ofthe land. But as most of the land was held within
the organisation of a village commune (mir), hisfreedom was still heavily circumscribed. The
change Stolypin aimed at was a transformation ofthe existing communes into a whole new class ofpeasant proprietors, each farming his own land,
not in strips as before, but consolidated into one
viable farm.The independent well-to-do peasant propri-etors were already a phenomenon, especially inwestern Russia. The purpose of the land reformassociated with Stolypin’s name was to increase
their number in all parts of Russia. Legislation
passed in 1906, 1910 and 1911 facilitated the
redistribution of land within the commune andgave the right to the peasant to secede from thecommune and claim the land he farmed. Howsuccessful did these reforms prove? The problemof Russian agriculture was gigantic, due to over-population, lack of capital, lack of knowledge and
simple peasant resistance to change. It has been
calculated that by 1916 about 2 million house-
holds had left the communes and set up their ownfarms. It was no more than a beginning, but asigniﬁcant one. But since by 1916 more than 80
per cent of the land was already being farmed by
peasants, redistribution of land by taking it away
from the larger landlords and the Church could
no longer solve the continuing problem of landhunger caused by overpopulation. The peasantrywas being divided between the richer, the poorer
and the landless peasants driven into the towns to
swell discontent there. Rapid industrialisation
promoted by the state, the spread of education,political agitation and the continuing increase ofthe population all produced severe social tensions.1MULTINATIONAL RUSSIAN AND HABSBURG EMPIRES45

He was more and moredominated by his wife, Empress Alexandra,
devoted but equally narrow-minded, and she in
turn was inﬂuenced by the ‘magic’ of Rasputin,
whose spiritual healing was alleviating the agoniesof their son, the sick tsarevitch.Yet, by the eve of the 1914 war a successionof energetic ministers such as Witte and Stolypin
had brought about some change. Higher agri-
cultural prices and reforms did beneﬁt rural Russia
and pacify the peasants, but in the towns the stan-dard of living of the workers did not improve.Workers had gained limited rights to form trade
unions. Bad conditions and an increasing polit-
ical awareness that change was necessary and pos-
sible led after 1900 to strikes. The only answerthe government knew was repression, whichreached its horrifying peak in the Lena goldﬁelds
in 1912 when the troops killed 170 miners 
striking for higher wages. The years 1913 and
1914 saw a renewal of massive strikes especiallyin St Petersburg and Moscow and, signiﬁcantly,they became increasingly political.Faced with these internal disorders, the tsarand his ministers had to weigh, during that fateful
July of 1914, the question of war and peace.
Would war release a patriotic spirit that woulddrown the voice of revolution or would it sparkoff the great upheaval? The tsar’s agonising over
the fateful mobilisation order indicates vividly
how he was fully aware that he might be signing
the death warrant of his autocratic rule, perhapshis dynasty. Certainly, during these last criticalweeks, decisions which required the utmost cool-
ness of judgement were being taken under the
daily tensions of unrest much more immediate
and severe than those facing the kaiser in Berlin.
How had the tsar allowed Russia to be broughtto so dangerous an international position in 1914when what Russia most needed was peace?Despite facing enormous problems at home,Russia’s ambitions to expand did not slacken.Having reached the borders of China, Russiamade a bid to dominate Manchuria. China was at
the mercy of the European powers who acquired
strategic outposts and dominated its trade, Britainﬁrst and foremost. The disastrous Boxer rising of1900 gave another blow to the ramshackle struc-ture to which the Manchu dynasty had declined
and further opportunities to the Europeans to
seize more of its land. This time the Russians took
the largest bite, seeking to detach Manchuria.This brought it into conﬂict with the growingJapanese power and alarmed Britain. Japan and
Britain drew together in an alliance in 1902 
and Britain paid the price of agreeing to support
Japanese ambitions in Korea. The outcome was
war between Japan and Russia in 1904 which theJapanese famously won the following year, a giantstep in the growth of a new power in the Paciﬁc.
Russia was checked in eastern Asia and turned its
interests back to the Balkans. To free its hand 
it reached an imperial settlement, in the MiddleEast and on the frontiers of India, with Britain in 1907.Russia’s statesmen tried to act in cooperationwith the Habsburg Empire, at ﬁrst carving up
their spheres of interest. But in 1908 cooperationbroke down. The Austrians owned two Turkishprovinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina which they
had already occupied since 1878.In 1908 the Balkan ﬁre was lit. The ‘Bosniancrisis’ marks a turning point in the relations of the
powers before 1914. Slav Serbia, resenting theannexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, appealed toRussia for support; Austria relied on Germany.
No one was ready to ﬁght but good relations
between Austria and Russia were at an end. Also
ended was the Austro-Russian understanding tosettle their imperial rivalries in the Balkans. Nowthey intrigued against each other and the fuse
leading to war in 1914 was lit.Other European nations with their own ambi-tions added to the breakdown of stability in the
Balkans. The Ottoman Empire was attempting toreform itself after the Young Turk revolution of1908. But Turkey was weak. Italy attacked
Turkey in 1911 and annexed Tripoli. The small
Balkan states, equally greedy, wanted Turkish ter-
ritory in Europe and were ready to ﬁght eachother over the spoils.Turkish weakness, Balkan nationalism and therivalry of Austria and Russia destabilised south-
east Europe.46SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
At ﬁrst the Balkan states went to war againstTurkey. The Balkan League of Serbia, Bulgaria,Greece and Montenegro attacked the Turks in
October 1912 and defeated them. As a result of
the war Serbia greatly increased its territory, to
the alarm of Austria. All the great Europeanpowers stepped in to supervise the peace andRussia had to agree to Austrian demands limiting
Serbia’s gains.But hardly had the question been settled in London in May 1913 when the members of
the Balkan League fought each other. Bulgarianow attacked Serbia and Greece; Montenegro,Romania and Turkey joined Serbia and Greece in
attacking Bulgaria. Bulgaria was forced to make
peace and yield many of its gains from the ﬁrst
Balkan war.The conﬂicts of the Balkan states would havemattered comparatively little outside their own
region of the world, but for the effects on Austria-
Hungary and on Russia. There was little consis-
tency about Russian policy in the Balkans. StrongPan-Slav feelings motivated Russia’s ambassadorsin the Balkans and these were backed by sections
of public opinion within Russia. But the ofﬁcial
line taken by Sergei Sazonov, Izvolsky’s successor
at the Foreign Ministry in St Petersburg, was
caution. The result of the Balkan wars was toweaken Russia’s position as well as Austria’s. ForRussia the future appeared full of uncertainties in
the Balkans. The eventual alignment of the indi-
vidual Balkan states, with Austria-Hungary and
Germany on the one side and Russia and Franceon the other, was unpredictable. Only Serbia wasstill Russia’s ﬁrm ally and that was not for love of
Russia but due to its enmity of Austria-Hungary.These uncertainties made the Russians muchmore nervous about the future of the Straits of
Constantinople. They were not only vital stra-tegically but, with the upsurge of the Russianeconomy, they also formed an increasingly
important link in the chain of Russia’s trade with
the rest of the world. Three-quarters of its grain
exports were shipped from the Black Sea throughthe Straits, and grain constituted some 40 percent of Russia’s total export trade. The Russians
wished the Turks to remain the guardians as long
as they did not fall under hostile inﬂuence untilthe Russians were strong enough to control them. Germany now had become a double threat:as Austria-Hungary’s ally and, since 1909, as
Turkey’s ‘friend’. The appointment of a German
general, Liman von Sanders in November 1913
to command the army corps stationed in Con-stantinople greatly alarmed St Petersburg. Russianprotests this time worked. General von Sanders
was promoted to the rank of ﬁeld marshal, which
made him too grand merely to command troops
in Constantinople.On the plus side for the Russians was the atti-tude of the French who in 1912 strongly revivedthe Franco-Russian alliance. But Russian policy
would in the end be dictated by Russian interests.
Until Russia’s military reorganisation was com-
pleted, and while still faced with strikes and unrestat home, Russia wanted to avoid war. That wasstill the view of the Council of Ministers called to
debate the question in January 1914, just a few
months before the outbreak of war.The Habsburg Empire had been a formidableEuropean power for more than four centuries.
Was its disintegration in the twentieth century the
inevitable consequence of the two most powerful
currents of modern history: nationalism and
industrialisation? These threatened, respectively,the common bond of loyalty which the national-ities composing the Dual Monarchy felt for the
dynasty and the acceptance of an existing social
order. In many ways industrialisation and nation-
alism were contradictory forces in Austria-Hungary. The large market of the empire and freetrade within it helped industrial progress; social-
ism, which grew with industrial expansion, also
called for an allegiance that cut across the ethnic
differences of nationality. Nationalism, on the
other hand, was divisive and threatened to breakup the empire. But nationalism contained theseeds of conﬂict within itself. There could be no
easy agreement in a part of Europe where the
nationalities were so intermingled as to what
precise national frontiers should be drawn, orwho should form the majority in a state or whichpeoples must acquiesce in remaining a minority.
There would be conﬂicts and tensions however
matters were arranged and the majority of the1MULTINATIONAL RUSSIAN AND HABSBURG EMPIRES47
emperor’s subjects felt ‘better the devil we know’.There was much to be said for the supranationalsolution which the Habsburg Monarchy repre-
sented. Multinational states break apart when the
central power is weakened beyond the point of
recovery. This did not happen in the HabsburgEmpire until 1915. In defeated Russia, Lenin and Trotsky were able to restore the authority 
of the central power through civil war, but no
such Habsburg recovery was possible in 1918.
Nevertheless, it took four years of devastating war
to break Habsburg power and the cohesion of theMonarchy.It has frequently been claimed that centralpower had been eroded half a century earlier with
the constitutional settlement of 1867. But the
settlement stood the test of time when judged bycentral European standards. The greatest threatto the Monarchy was Hungarian independence.
After 1867 there was no longer a serious possi-
bility of this. The extensive rights which the
Magyars were granted in the historic kingdom ofHungary reconciled them to the unity of theempire under the personal link of the emperor-
king. For the Magyars the continuation of the
empire meant that the entire power of the
Monarchy was available to defend their position
against external and internal enemies.The settlement of 1867 granted to each half ofthe empire its own government with control of
internal affairs; this included, importantly, powers
to decide what rights were to be conceded to the
other nationalities living within the jurisdiction ofthe kingdom of Hungary and Cis-Leithania, as theAustrian half of the empire was ofﬁcially called.
But the central power of the empire remained
strong and real after 1867. Finance, foreign affairs
and military matters remained the responsibility of
the imperial ministries in Vienna, whose ministerswere chosen by the emperor. The emperor wascommander-in-chief of the imperial army. Inanother important way this unique imperial con-stitution actually strengthened central power. The
democratic constitutional trend of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries could not be entirely
halted in the empire. But franchise concessionswere granted for the separate parliaments sitting inVienna and Budapest. In Austria the year 1907
saw the introduction of manhood suffrage. The
Magyars refused to accept any substantial reforms.
But the Hungarian parliament exercised much
more real power over the Hungarian governmentthan the Austrian over the Austrian govern-ment. There existed no parliament for the empire
as a whole that could inﬂuence or control the
crucially important joint imperial ministries.Indirect parliamentary inﬂuence was in theoryprovided for by the system of the ‘delegations’,representatives of the Austrian and Hungarian
parliaments meeting separately and together (in
theory) to deal with questions affecting the joint
ministries. In practice, what concerned the dele-gations mainly was ﬁnance, customs, commercialpolicy and the contributions to the common
budget to be paid by Austria and by Hungary.
These questions were settled, after much wran-
gling based on obvious self-interest, for ten years
at a time. The emperor’s ‘reserved’ powers inforeign and military affairs remained virtuallyabsolute through his choice of ministers and
refusal to take notice of any parliamentary disap-
proval. His power would not have been so com-
pletely preserved in the twentieth century, andwith it a strong central power, but for the dualismof the empire and, therefore, the absence of a
single imperial parliament. Consequently, imper-
ial policies in war and foreign affairs were con-
ducted by just a handful of men. These included
the heads of the three joint ministries, with theminister of foreign affairs presiding; on importantoccasions the prime minister of Hungary, who
had a constitutional right to be consulted on
questions of foreign policy, and other ministers
were invited to join in the discussion.Among some of the Slavs, dualism was seen asa device for excluding the Slav majority from 
their rightful and equal place in the empire. By
dividing the empire, the Magyars and Germans48SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
Austria-Hungary’s population(in millions)19001910

constituted the majority, each in their own half.The majority of the 21 million Slavs (approximate1910 ﬁgures) in the empire as a whole were thus
turned into minorities.The ‘Slavs’ were not uniﬁed in religion, socialstructure or tradition. The rivalries and hostilitiesbetween them were at least as important as theirsupposedly common interests. The Magyar–
German compromise of 1867 led to parallel small
compromises within each half of the empire. In
Austria, the Polish gentry were given privileges 
at the expense of the Ruthenes; the Czechs were from time to time allowed special rights; butSerb, Croat and Slovene cultural development
was restricted. The struggle between German-
speaking Habsburg subjects and the other nation-
alities was bitter at the local level and in parlia-ment, but it was not, as in Hungary, systematicgovernment policy. In Hungary, the Magyars
allowed a special status to the Croats but
excluded the Slovaks and Serbs and Romanians
from any share of power or from exercisingautonomous rights.The politics of ‘Austria’ and of Hungary alsodiverged in other respects in the twentieth century.
In Austria one striking development was the emer-

gence of a socialist party led by Victor Adler which
gained a sizeable parliamentary following in 1907.Austrian politics were marred by the antics of theGerman nationalists and the anti-Semitic Christian
Socialists inspired by Karl Lueger. Conﬂicts bet-

ween nationalists in Austria frequently paralysed
parliament. The industrialised and prosperousCzechs demanded autonomy. The Germans inBohemia sought to keep the Czechs in an inferiornational status. The focus of the struggle was overthe ofﬁcial use of language. When the emperor’s
ministers made concessions with the Czechs, the
Germans refused cooperation with the govern-

ment and when concessions were made to theGermans the Czechs went into bitter opposition.In any case parliament was regarded by the
emperor as no more than an ‘advisory body’.The introduction of manhood suffrage inAustria in 1907 was intended to break the nation-

ality deadlock. For a brief time the Social Demo-
crats sat together, irrespective of national origin,whether German or Czech. It did not last. From
1908 to 1914 the old nationality conflict re-

asserted itself with as much vehemence as before.
The conﬂict of the national parties reduced theparliament in its splendid and imposing building inVienna to impotence. With such a record, parlia-

mentary government could win little respect
among the population as a whole.In Hungary, extensive franchise reforms wereblocked by the Magyar gentry as likely to under-mine Magyar predominance. Relations with the
non-Magyar nationalities remained bad down to
1914. Repression was the only policy consistently
adopted. Hungarian politics revolved around
largely unsuccessful attempts to modify the com-promise of 1867 so that the Magyars could gaingreater control over the army. But this was ﬁercely
resisted by Franz Josef, who threatened force
against any Hungarian government or parliament
seeking to tamper with the royal prerogatives.When now we marvel at the continued resi-lience of the Habsburg Empire, despite national
and constitutional conﬂicts, which seemed to

increase rather than diminish during the last years
of peace, we tend to overlook one question. Who
had anything to gain from driving the conﬂict toextremes and threatening the Habsburg Empirewith disintegration? Not the Magyars, not the
Germans, nor the Poles, who enjoyed greater 
liberties under Austrian than Russian and German
rule; not the Jews, whose talents transformed cultural Vienna; not the Czechs who believedtheir own security necessitated the empire; not
even the majority of Serbs and Croats in the
annexed provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.1MULTINATIONAL RUSSIAN AND HABSBURG EMPIRES49

Everywhere the mass of the peasantry wasattached to the Habsburg dynasty. Agitation forindependence, whether of Czech or southern
Slavs, was largely the work of a minority among
the more educated. The great majority of Franz
Josef’s subjects wanted the empire to continue
even though they differed so bitterly on the kind
of empire they wanted. Meanwhile the dynasty
and its central power, the imperial civil service and
administration, and the imperial army all carried
out their duties sustained by the common consentof the great majority of the people.Franz Josef had won the affection of his subjectssimply by always having been there. His family
misfortunes bravely borne, his simplicity and
honesty, and pride in his robustness in very old
age combined to make him the most respected
and venerated monarch in Europe. And all thisdespite the fact that he had made war on his ownsubjects in 1849 (Hungary) and had lost all the
wars in which Austria had engaged since his acces-
sion against Italy, France and Prussia. It was a
remarkable achievement.During the last years of the nineteenth andduring the early twentieth century, the empire
emerged as a modern state. In Hungary the
administration was virtually Magyarised. This
applied also to the judicial administration. But thecountry enjoyed a high reputation for justice,with admittedly the important exception of what
were seen as ‘political’ offences. The kingdom of
Hungary was Magyar: patriotism meant Magyar
patriotism; dissent from this view was treated
harshly. But, despite this fierce attempt to
Magyarise the nationalities on the peripheries of
the kingdom, the policy met with little success;
the nationalities preserved their identities. In the
Austrian half of the empire the governments
sought to arrive at settlements between Germans,Czechs and Poles acceptable to all sides.That the empire was, largely, so well governedwas in no small part due to an incorruptible and,
on the whole, intelligent and fair-minded bureau-
cracy of civil servants and jurists. It is true that 
in the Austrian half of the empire the Germans
constituted some 80 per cent of the civilservants
thoughby population they were entitled only to a
third. The much better education of the Germansaccounts for some of this predominance. In
Hungary deliberate Magyarisation led to more
than 19 per cent of government service being in
Hungarian-speaking hands. In the central imperialadministration the Germans also played the majorrole, with more than half the civil servants
German-speaking. But one can certainly not speak
of a totally German-dominated imperial adminis-
tration. In the principal joint ministries of the
empire, Franz Josef ensured that the three com-mon ministers never came from the same half ofthe Monarchy. The senior Foreign Ministry was
held in turn by a Saxon German, a Hungarian, 
an Austrian German, a Pole, a Hungarian and an
Austrian German.The economic development of the empire thatwas disappointingly slow in the latter part of the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries implies a
comparison with western and northern Europe.But the empire’s centre was in the Balkans, thegrain-producing Hungarian plain. Within the
empire lay regions such as the Czech provinces,
which achieved a development comparable to the
most advanced areas of Europe.The empire provides great contrasts betweencomparative wealth and stark poverty. Agri-
cultural backwardness and an increasing popula-
tion condemned the peasants of Galicia to
continuous poverty. Large-scale emigration was
one consequence. (The empire’s population grewfrom 46.9 million in 1900 to 52.4 million in1910.) In Bohemia, and in upper and lower
Austria, agriculture, as well as industry, turned
these regions into the most prosperous in the
empire. In Hungary the owners of the great
landed estates led the way to the introduction ofbetter farming methods. The central Hungarianplain became one of the granaries of Europe. The
imperial customs union, freeing all trade within
the empire, opened up to Hungary’s agriculture
the market of the more industrialised Austrianhalf of the empire.In the twentieth century Austria-Hungaryachieved a fast rate of industrial growth in the
favoured regions. Nevertheless, the empire as a50SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
whole lagged far behind the more advanced west-
ern and northern European nations. Regional variations were as marked in industrial as in agri-

cultural development. The most successful agricul-

tural parts of the empire were also the most
industrially advanced: upper and lower Austria,
Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia and Hungary
proper. Industrialisation had made little impact in
Galicia, Dalmatia or Transylvania. In 1911, textilesand clothing, tobacco and foodstuffs, togetherwith wood, leather and paper accounted for nearly
two-thirds of the Austrian half of the empire’s
industrial output. But imperial policies of free trade
within the empire tended to maintain these
regional differences of progress and backwardness.
On the other hand, it needs to be remembered
that without state aid in the development of the
railways, without good administration and internalpeace and security throughout the empire, the eco-
nomic conditions of the people would have been
far worse than they actually were.It is remarkable that the empire, beset by somany problems internally, backward in economic
development and also poor, achieved a high repu-
tation in the arts and was acknowledged to be one
of the great powers of Europe. The Monarchy’suniversities were second to none, the musical, lit-erary and theatrical life of Vienna, Budapest and
Prague, and the renown of Freud and Liszt and
Strauss, were celebrated throughout the Western
world. The Monarchy’s status as a great power
had been diminished, it is true, but not extin-
guished by defeats in the nineteenth-century con-
tinental wars that created united Italy andGermany. In 1900 the empire was still consideredone of the foremost military powers of Europe, a
bulwark against the possibility of the Russian orGerman dominance of south-eastern Europe. Theterritorially large Habsburg Empire was thus amajor element in the pre-1914 European balance
of power whose disappearance, the other powers
felt, would create grave new problems.Actually the empire’s military capacity was over-
rated. The perennial lack of funds was one reason
for its weakness. Another unique problem was 
that it was largely ofﬁcered by German-speaking
Austrians and a smaller number of Hungarians; thetroops themselves were composed of all the
nationalities and spoke in many languages. Even
worse was the incompetence of the general staff.
Only in the two years before the war of 1914 was
the army increased to a potential wartime strength
of 1.5 million men. Military and economic weak-

ness made the Monarchy’s foreign ministers
cautious and conservative.There is a shape, logic and consistency toHabsburg foreign policy in the nineteenth
century with its emphasis on the importance of
tradition and of dynastic rule and its opposition
to nationalism. The loss of the Italian provinces
was therefore seen as a particularly heavy blow. 
If the neighbours of the Habsburg Empire,Romania and Serbia, followed the example ofPiedmont in the wars of Italian uniﬁcation, justi-
fying their efforts by an appeal to the right of
national self-determination, then the Habsburg
Empire must disintegrate altogether. Serbia cast
in the role of Piedmont was the nightmare vision
that drove the emperor and his ministers to stake
the future of the empire on the ﬁeld of battle inJuly 1914. But they also recognised that the realthreat had not been Piedmont but Piedmont in
alliance with France in 1859 and with Prussia in1MULTINATIONAL RUSSIAN AND HABSBURG EMPIRES51

1866. The real threat in 1914 was felt to be notSerbia but Serbia in alliance with Russia.Security and integrity are basic objectives ofany state’s foreign policy. But the great powers of
pre-1914 Europe also considered it axiomatic that
they should possess spheres of inﬂuence and con-
trol beyond their own state frontiers. In the nine-teenth century the Habsburgs were forced toabandon their traditional role of inﬂuence ﬁrst in
the Italian and then in the German states. By the
twentieth century the only ‘frontier’ left open was
the Balkan. Not to suffer a third defeat on this lastfrontier was seen as a matter of vital importancefor the future of the empire.With the decline of the Ottoman Empire inEurope the future of the Balkan peoples, divided
and intermingled in religious beliefs, in tradition,in culture and in socio-economic structure, pre-occupied the European great powers. But the
Balkan states pursued policies of their own and
were locked in rivalry over the disposition of the
still Turkish or formerly Turkish lands.Once Russia had recovered from defeat in theFar East, the attention of St Petersburg revertedto the Balkans and a rediscovery of Russia’s Slav
mission. A much more active Russian policy now
coincided with a new period of Ottoman weak-
ness caused by the internal upheavals of theYoung Turk movement (1908 to 1910). It alsocoincided with the growing ambitions and rival-
ries of the Balkan states, themselves casting cov-
etous eyes on Macedonia and other territories still
ruled by the Turks. The Balkans were becoming
a powder barrel. Austro-Russian cooperationmight have contained these tensions. Instead,Russia’s ambitious ministers at the various Balkan
capitals were adding to the growing turmoil. The
turning point came in 1908–9.In the Monarchy, the foreign minister CountAehrenthal was a well-known advocate of a policyof cooperation and agreement with Russia. He
regarded Austria-Hungary as a ‘satiated’ state that
needed no more territories and no more Slavs. But
as a ﬁnal step of consolidation – almost a technical
consolidation – whose purpose was to regulariseand remove all uncertainty, he wished to convertthe Monarchy’s position in Bosnia-Herzegovina
from that of the permanently occupying power(since 1878) to one of sovereignty. He was pre-
pared to pay compensation to the Turks and togive up the occupation of another Turkish terri-

tory, the strategically important land known as
Novipazar. This withdrawal would also convince
the Russians that Austria-Hungary had abandonedall thought of territorial expansion. Talks werearranged with the Russian foreign minister,
Alexander Izvolski. Their famous, and unrecorded,
conversation took place at the castle of Buchlau 
in 1908. From the available evidence it seems 
clear that the whole basis of these talks was theintention to strengthen Austro-Russian coopera-
tion. Izvolski said that Russia would diplomatically
support Austria-Hungary’s wish to annex Bosnia-
Herzegovina. In return he asked for, and obtained,
Aehrenthal’s promise of diplomatic support for aRussian proposal to the powers to change the ruleof the Straits. Aehrenthal soon after, while Izvolski
toured Western Europe and had not even time to
consult the tsar about the Buchlau ‘bargain’,
announced the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovinato Europe. Izvolski was furious. He had no successwith his attempt to change the rule of the Straits:
Britain rejected the proposal outright. To save
face, Izvolski now claimed he had been tricked by
Aehrenthal.From here on the threads lead to the cata-strophe of 1914. Out of the breakdown of rela-tions between Izvolski and Aehrenthal grew the
prolonged Bosnian crisis. Serbia’s nationalist feel-
ings had been wildly aroused by the Monarchy’s
annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, inhabitedby many Serbs. Russia backed Serbia and wasinsistent on ‘compensation’ for Serbia and also
that the Monarchy should submit the whole 
question of annexation to a conference of powers.
With the German ally’s support, Aehrenthal
refused both demands. Russia and Britain andFrance backed away. Serbia did not. In 1909Serbia and Austria-Hungary came close to war,
with Russia acting as Serbia’s protector. In reality
neither Russia nor any of the powers were ready
for war in 1909. One cannot help speculating howdifferent a course history might have taken ifAustria-Hungary had used its superior strength to
defeat Serbia then. As it was, Izvolski drew back.
On Germany fell the odium of having threatened52SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
Russia with a peremptory note that unless itrecognised the annexation at once, Germanywould not hold the Monarchy back from attack-
ing Serbia. Izvolski could now claim that the
German ‘ultimatum’ forced Russia to give way.
More important, the crisis marked the end of tol-erably good Austro-Russian relations. Were theirBalkan differences really so irreconcilable? The
collision of the two empires was due to miscalcu-
lation rather than deliberate intent. In 1909
Russia was the more aggressive of the two states.The Russian diplomats in the years after 1909redoubled their efforts to re-establish Russia’sdamaged prestige among the Balkan states. These
moves coincided with the intrigues and national
ambitions of the Balkan states themselves, whose
policies in the end could not be controlled by theRussians.In 1911 the Italians made war on the OttomanEmpire. This started a new period of continuous
Balkan tensions. In 1912 the Habsburgs believed
that the Russians had inspired a Balkan League ofGreece, Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria toattack Turkey. These states had temporarily buried
their own disputes over Macedonia and other ter-
ritorial disputes to grab more lands from Turkey.
Then they, in turn, fell out over the booty in 1913
when Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece and wasitself defeated by a new alliance of Balkan states.Apart from the certainty of Austro-Serbenmity, there were no other certainties in theBalkans during the last years before 1914. NeitherRussia nor the Monarchy could be sure at anypoint of crisis which of the other Balkan states
would side with whom. The unhappy conse-

quence for the peace of Europe was that Russia
and Austria-Hungary felt equally threatened bythe diplomatic intrigues of the other. Russia, withpromises of French support, was both fearful and
active. The Dual Monarchy could never assume
that the German ally would stand behind it. As
for Italy, its alliance was nominal. Italy was
regarded as a potential enemy. So the Habsburgsfelt unsure of the future.Austria-Hungary’s bitter opponent, Serbia,had emerged greatly enlarged from the two
Balkan wars. In 1913, by helping to create inde-
pendent and friendly Albania, Austria-Hungarysucceeded in checking Serbia’s further expansionto the Adriatic. This was achieved not so much
by the ‘conference of European’ powers as by the
Dual Monarchy’s own threats delivered to Serbia.
Count Leopold Berchtold, Aehrenthal’s successorat the Foreign Ministry since 1912, learnt fromthese experiences that Austria-Hungary would
have to rely on its own ﬁrmness. Behind Serbia
stood Russia. But Franz Josef and his ministers
believed that ﬁrm diplomacy could still break the
hostile ring of states and Russia’s manifest designto encircle the Monarchy, provided Germanyloyally backed the Habsburg Empire. Sarajevo
changed all that.1MULTINATIONAL RUSSIAN AND HABSBURG EMPIRES53
The Great War disrupted and destroyed lives ona scale never known before. More than 60 million
men were mobilised and 8.5 million were killed,
21 million were wounded and in every town andvillage in Europe the blinded and maimed victimsserved as daily reminders decades after the war
was over. In every town and village war memori-
als commemorate the names of those who gave
their lives for their country. The war, which
involved millions and for which millions suffered,was launched by the decision of just a few mennegotiating and conspiring in secret. They bear a
heavy responsibility. What made these men act
the way they did? Were they aware of what they
were doing, or did they just muddle into warthrough confusion and error?There was a widespread illusion about thecourse the war would take. The troops left for the
front believing that they would be home by
Christmas. With the new mass armies it was
thought that the war would be decided by thedevastating battles fought at the outset. No oneexpected that this would be just another war, like
those of the mid-nineteenth century, ending with
the victors exacting some territorial and ﬁnancial
punishment from the vanquished and leading toa new balance of power. There was, however, noillusion about what was at stake. Grey’s famous
words about the lights going out all over Europe
expressed a sentiment that would have been 
well understood in Paris, Berlin, Vienna and StPetersburg. Bethmann Hollweg gloomily pre-
dicted the toppling of thrones and the victory ofsocialism. In Vienna, the future existence of the
Habsburg Monarchy was felt to be at stake: defeat
would lead to its dissolution. Tsarist Russia wasbeset by serious internal disturbances and Frenchsociety was deeply divided on the eve of the war.
There were no illusions about the devastating
consequences of this war from which a new world
would emerge. There were hesitations on the
brink of war. It was then too late. How had thepowers allowed the crisis caused initially by a ter-rorist crime, the assassination of an archduke, the
heir to the Habsburg throne, to escalate until
there was no way out but a devastating European
war? There seems to be no obvious connectionbetween the murder committed by a young manin Bosnia and the clash of armies of millions.The assassination of the archduke FranzFerdinand in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 was the
work of a handful of Bosnian youths who had
romantically dedicated their lives to Serb nation-alism and had been greatly influenced by theRussian terrorists in exile. They received their
weapons from the secret Serbian conspiratorial
Black Hand organisation headed by Colonel
Dragutin Dimitrijevic´who was also in charge of
army secret intelligence. The Bosnian youths,who had spent some time in Belgrade, had been
helped across the Serb frontier by Serbian agents.
The prime minister of Serbia, Nikola Pasˇic´, andKing Alexander were powerless against the armyofﬁcers and the Black Hand. But Pasˇic´did send
Chapter 4OVER THE BRINKTHE FIVE-WEEK CRISIS, 28 JUNE–1 AUGUST 1914a vague warning to Vienna that the archdukewould be in danger when he visited Sarajevo.The amateur assassins almost bungled theirtask. On the morning of 28 June, the ﬁrst attempt

failed and the bomb thrown by one of the six con-

spirators exploded under the car following thearchduke. Incredibly the archduke, his wife and the governor of Bosnia drove through the open
streets again the same afternoon. When the 
archduke’s chauffeur hesitated which way to go, by
mere chance one of the conspirators, Gavrilo
Princip, found himself opposite the archduke’s stationary car. He aimed two shots at the archdukeand the governor of Bosnia; they mortally
wounded Franz Ferdinand and his wife.The government of Serbia did not want war in1914, for the country had not yet recovered fromthe exertions of the Balkan wars. But the gov-ernment could not control the army nor prevent
the secret societies from fomenting and aiding
anti-Habsburg movements in Bosnia and Herze-
govina. The assassination of the archduke wasunwelcome news to the government, for the kingand his government would now be called to
account for allowing anarchical political condi-
tions which gave the terrorists their base and
power.In Vienna, the Dual Monarchy’s foreign minister,Count Berchtold, before those fateful shots at
Sarajevo had given no serious thought to war. He
did not judge the internal state of the Habsburg
Monarchy as so desperate. Serbia and Russia wouldsurely be restrained by ﬁrm Austro-Hungariandiplomacy backed by imperial Germany. The
Habsburgs could continue to rely upon the divi-

sions and mutual antagonisms of their Slav sub-

jects. The Slovenes were Catholics and loyal to the
Crown. The Croats were Catholics too, and unionwith the Greek Orthodox Serbs was opposed bythe majority of them. Nor were the Serbs in favour
of any general union of southern Slavs, ‘Yugo-

slavia’, which would place them in the minority of
such a new state. They dreamt of a ‘GreaterSerbia’, but this would have placed the Croats in aminority. The idea of ‘Yugoslavia’ had won the
adherence of only a minority of students and
intellectuals. The majority of the southern Slavshad no thought of leaving the HabsburgMonarchy in 1914.Every Austro-Hungarian minister since 1909realised that the threat to the existence of the
Habsburg Empire was due not to the challenge
of any of the small Balkan states such as Serbia,but to Russia utilising Balkan discontents againstthe Dual Monarchy. That is why the misunder-
standing and dispute between Russia and Austria-
Hungary – the so-called Bosnian crisis – was such
a signiﬁcant milestone on the road to war.Russia had been forced to back down whenfaced with Germany’s determined support ofAustria-Hungary. In this way, the changed status
of two provinces in the Balkans – which made no
real difference to the map of Europe – led to dis-

astrous consequences out of all proportion to theissues involved. Henceforth, the good Austro-Russian understanding, designed to prevent 
the two powers from becoming so entangled in
local Balkan conﬂicts that thereby they could be
dragged into hostility with each other, wasbroken by crises that threatened the peace ofEurope. Rivalry, suspicion and intrigue in the
Balkans replaced the cooperation of former years.
The ﬁnal crisis was occasioned by the assassina-
tion of the archduke.In Vienna, news of the assassination entirelychanged the attitude of Berchtold and the majority of the Monarchy’s ministers. A diplo-
matic offensive was no longer thought enough.
Habsburg prestige was now so seriously involved
that, unless Serbia was ‘punished’, the empire’srole as a great power would be at an end. Serbiacould not be allowed to get away with this last
and most serious provocation by sheltering
behind Russia. If the Monarchy could prove that
Russian protection could not save Serbia from its
wrath, the lesson would not be lost on the otherBalkan states and Austria-Hungary’s internationalposition of power would be reasserted. Berchtold
concluded that Serbia’s hostility must be broken
and that only Serbian submission to the will of
the Monarchy should be allowed to save it fromwar and conquest.There were three obstacles. The Austro-Hungarian army was not ready for war: it would
need more than a month to prepare. The chief of1OVER THE BRINK55
staff, Conrad von Hötzendorf, moreover, pointedout that, if Russia intervened, the Austro-Hungarian army would need German military
cooperation to cope successfully with a war on two
fronts, the Serbian and Russian. The Monarchy’s
ministers were in any case convinced that theMonarchy could not risk war with Russia unlessthe German ally stood side by side with Austria-
Hungary in war. Would the imperial German gov-

ernment support the Monarchy now? The third
obstacle to war was internal, the opposition of the
Hungarian prime minister, Count Tisza.On 4 July 1914, the Council of Ministers,meeting in Vienna, decided that the ﬁrst step was
to ascertain the attitude of the kaiser and his min-
isters. Count Hoyos was sent to Berlin with a per-
sonal letter from Emperor Franz Josef to thekaiser, and a set of questions from the Monarchy’sministers. They did not beat about the bush, 
but wanted to know whether Germany would
come to Austria-Hungary’s help if Russia chose
to intervene on behalf of Serbia. They alsoexplained what was in store for Serbia. Serbiawould be eliminated ‘as a power factor in the 
Balkans’.From a variety of recorded conversations, inBerlin, for two years and more there had beenmounting fears about the planned expansion ofRussian military power. The weakness of the
Habsburg Monarchy became increasingly appar-
ent, and there were serious doubts about its future
after the old emperor’s death, which could not belong delayed. There were also nagging doubtsabout Austria-Hungary’s loyalty to the alliance
with Germany. Would the alliance survive if
Germany once again forced the Monarchy to
desist from doing what it thought imperative for
its survival – to show it was stronger than Serbiaand would not tolerate Serbian hostility? ImperialGermany felt it needed the support of Austria-
Hungary if the mass Russian Slav armies were to
be checked. A war with Russia arising out of an
Austro-Serb conﬂict would ensure the Monarchy’ssupport. A war starting between Germany andRussia, or Germany and France, might not ﬁnd
Austria-Hungary on Germany’s side. Then there
was a calculation of quite a different kind.Bethmann Hollweg hoped to weaken, perhapseven to break up, the alignment of Russia, Franceand Britain. Bethmann Hollweg’s calculations
were all based on ‘ifs’. If Russia should decide to
back Serbia and then applied to Paris for backing,
and if France then refused to risk war withGermany so that Russia might threaten Austria-Hungary with war, Russia would discover that the
French alliance was, in reality, worthless. Ifall thishappened then Germany would be in a position to
win back Russia’s friendship, perhaps even its
alliance. If, on the other hand, it should come towar, then better now than later. But the DualMonarchy must initiate the war so that at home it
could be presented as being fought in defence of
Germany’s ally against tsarist Russia. Russia would
be cast in the role of aggressor.The critical discussions between the kaiser,Bethmann Hollweg and the military took place
immediately after the arrival of Count Hoyos in
Berlin. The decision, when it was reached, was
not the kaiser’s alone. That is a myth. The deci-sion was to back Austria-Hungary to the hilt, withGerman military support if necessary, should
Russia intervene to prevent the Dual Monarchy
from dealing with Serbia. The Habsburg minis-
ters were given a free hand to settle with Serbia
in any way they thought appropriate. That wasthe message to Vienna on 6 July, the kaiser’sfamous ‘blank cheque’. The Habsburg ministers
were also urged to act quickly against Serbia while
the governments of Europe were still shocked by
the assassinations at Sarajevo. In Germany, thechief of staff, General Moltke, continued hishealth cure at the spa of Karlsbad. Admiral Tirpitz
stayed away from Berlin and the kaiser departed
on his yacht to cruise in the North Sea. Every-
thing was done to avoid an air of crisis, to cam-
ouﬂage the impending Habsburg action. Why? Itcould only have been to allay British, Russian andFrench suspicions that Germany secretly stood
behind Austria-Hungary. A diplomatic triumph
for Austria-Hungary and Germany was still
preferable to war. Europe was to be faced with asudden fait accompli.What went wrong? In Vienna the ministerswere not unanimous, even after receiving the
German assurances. Count Tisza, the powerful56SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14
Hungarian prime minister, remained opposed towar at their meeting on 7 July and the followingweek gave way only on condition that the Dual
Monarchy ﬁrst agreed not to annex any Serbian
territory after the expected victory. Tisza, a
Magyar, wanted to see no more Slavs added to thepopulation of the empire. Then there was furtherdelay as the army asked for more time. Berchtold
used it to compile a justiﬁcatory dossier of Serbia’s
recent wrongdoings for presentation to the chan-
celleries of Europe when the time for action even-
tually came. Then Berchtold decided to wait untilthe French president, Poincaré, and the Frenchprime minister, René Viviani, had ended their visit
to St Petersburg. Thereby, he hoped that Austria
would act at the very moment when Russia would
ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to consult its French ally.More than three weeks had now elapsed sincethe assassination of Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo.
The Austrians had worked in greatest secrecy, and
Europe had been lulled into a false sense of calm.
On 23 July the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum waspresented in Belgrade and, in just six days,Europe plunged headlong from peace to certain
war. On 25 July, Serbia mobilised its army and,
in a cleverly worded reply later that day, ap-
peared to accept many of the Austrian demands,
although not to the point of submitting Serbia to Austrian supervision. The same evening, theAustro-Hungarian ambassador left Belgrade 
and Austria-Hungary mobilised against Serbia.
Even though the Austro-Hungarian army would
not be ready for another three weeks, Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July and, to makewar irrevocable, bombarded Belgrade on 29 July.Between the break of diplomatic relations andthe actual declaration of war, Sir Edward Grey
attempted mediation and sent proposals to Berlin
in an attempt to preserve the peace of Europe.Bethmann Hollweg wanted no such interferenceand Grey’s efforts came to nothing. When the
kaiser learnt how the Serbians had replied to the
ultimatum, he was personally delighted. So much
for the myth that he was thirsting to go to war.He immediately wrote a note on the morning of28 July from his palace in Potsdam, expressing his
evident relief that now there was no longer any
need for war – ‘On the whole the wishes of theDanube Monarchy have been acceded to, everycause for war has vanished’ – and he added thathe was ready to mediate. But by then Bethmann
Hollweg and Berchtold had instigated the
Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia
which the kaiser heard about later that day.Bethmann Hollweg now made every effort tolocalise the war. On 30 July, he urged Vienna to
exchange views with St Petersburg. He resisted
calls for mobilisation in Berlin and he initiated the
kaiser’s personal telegrams appealing to the tsar
not to mobilise.The weak tsar was under pressure from his ownmilitary advisers to mobilise. The French military,
too, were urging mobilisation and the French
ambassador in St Petersburg, Maurice Paléologue,
pressed their views on the foreign minister,Sazonov. The French general staff was terriﬁed
that war would begin in the west and ﬁnd the

Russians unprepared. Russia, if it went to war,
could count on French support; the tsar had
known this for certain ever since the visit ofPresident Poincaré and Prime Minister Viviani toSt Petersburg (20–3 July). But the Russians, in so
vital a question for the empire, would reach their
own decisions just as the Austrians had had to do.The reaction of the tsar, Sazonov and his minis-
ters was to seek to ‘localise’ the crisis in a way nei-
ther Germany nor Austria-Hungary had in mind.When Bethmann Hollweg spoke of ‘localisation’,
he meant that the Dual Monarchy should be
allowed to dictate terms to Serbia. The tsar and
Sazonov, on the other hand, hoped that Germanyand the other powers would stand aside whileRussia supported Serbia to prevent Austria-
Hungary from attacking Serbia. To the Russians,
the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia was hurling
down the gauntlet. But could Russia risk war now?
There was much civil disturbance and there werelarge-scale strikes; the army would be in a muchstronger position three years later. The news of the
ultimatum reached Sazonov on the morning of 24
July. His ﬁrst reaction was to advise the Serbians to
surrender to Austrian demands and not to ﬁght.
But later that afternoon, the Russian Council ofMinisters agreed to recommend to the tsar a ‘par-

tial’ mobilisation against Austria-Hungary only.
Russian involvement in the fate of Serbia was also1OVER THE BRINK57

sure on Austria-Hungary.The following day, 25 July, the tsar at an impe-rial council conﬁrmed the need for preparatory
military measures in anticipation of partial mobili-
sation. By 26 July, these secret preparations were
in full swing. The news of the Austrian declaration
of war on Serbia and bombardment of Belgrade
on 29 July threw St Petersburg into a frenzy. The
tsar agreed to a general mobilisation, but after
receiving the kaiser’s telegram changed this to a
‘partial mobilisation’, against Austria only. In real-
ity, though, the tsar’s motive was to avoid pushing
Germany into mobilisation – partial or total madeno difference, for the Austro-Hungarian-Germanalliance and campaign plans would necessitate
German mobilisation anyway. It was too late in
Berlin to continue playing the game of ‘localising’
the Austro-Serbian war. With the military in
Berlin now also in a frenzy, Moltke insisting on
the need to mobilise, Bethmann Hollweg and the
kaiser could not resist the ‘military imperative’
much longer. On 31 July, the Russian military
persuaded the tsar that a ‘partial mobilisation’ was
technically impossible, and Nicholas II consented
to general mobilisation. But the nature of German
military planning had made war inevitable after
the Russian partial mobilisation on 29 July.The very concept of the Schlieffen Plan wasresponsible for the situation that mobilisation
meant war. Its implications may not have been
grasped fully by the kaiser and Bethmann
Hollweg in July. But in militaristic Wilhelmine
Germany, the generals’ views on military neces-
sity were conclusive. Until the moment of Russian
mobilisation, Moltke, the chief of staff was 
ready to leave control to Chancellor Bethmann
Hollweg. But, when on 30 July it became clear
that the chancellor’s policy of frightening Russia
into acquiescence had failed, there was not a
moment to lose. France had to be defeated before
Russia could complete her mobilisation. TheGerman onslaught must now start without delayagainst Belgium and France. Ultimatums were
sent to Russia and France and war was declared
with unseemly haste on Russia on 1 August 1914,
and on France two days later. The German inva-sion of Belgium was followed by a British ulti-matum and declaration of war on 4 August.It was the same Schlieffen Plan that wasresponsible for forcing the pace in St Petersburg
and Paris. That the Germans would at the outset
turn the mass of their armies against France and
not Russia was known. The Russian–French mil-itary plans were constructed accordingly, with thepromise of an early Russian offensive to relieve
pressure on the French. That is why the French
military were so worried about ‘partial mobilisa-
tion’ against Austria-Hungary. In the event of warthey wanted Russia’s military effort to be directedagainst the main enemy, Germany. No wonder
Paléologue was urging full mobilisation in St
Petersburg. In this way was Bethmann Hollweg’s
diplomatic ‘offensive’ matched by the offensive
strategy of the German general staff with its aimof destroying the French will to resist by seekingtotal victory in the west.Behind the ‘governments’ – the handful of menwho made the decisions in Berlin, Vienna, Paris
and St Petersburg – stood populations willing toﬁght for republic, king and emperor. Only a tinyminority dissented. For the largest socialist party in
Europe, the German, the war was accepted as
being fought against tsarist Russian aggression.
The different nationalities of the Dual Monarchy
all fought for the Habsburgs, the French socialistsfought as enthusiastically in defence of their father-
land ruthlessly invaded by the Germans.The responsibility for starting the conﬂict inJuly and August must rest primarily on the shoul-
ders of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Russia andFrance reacted and chose to ﬁght rather than towithdraw from the confrontation, which would
have left the diplomatic victory to Germany and
Austria-Hungary. Whether they had wisely inter-
preted their national interests is another question.For Britain it was a preventive war. Not directlythreatened by Germany, Britain was looking to
the future and what that future would hold for it
if Germany were able to gain the mastery of con-
tinental Europe. But Britain’s was a ‘preventive’
war in quite a different sense to Germany’s. TheBritish government had done everything possibleto prevent war from breaking out, but the Cabinet
decided it could not afford to stand aside.1OVER THE BRINK59
Yet Britain cannot be absolved from blame.War broke out in 1914 not only as a consequence
of the shots at Sarajevo. The tensions that had
been building up in Europe and the wider worldfor two decades and more had created the frameof mind that led the European chancelleries along
a fatal path. For Britain, faced with the relative
decline of its power, the problem of defending its
empire loomed ever larger. It negotiated withFrance a division of interests of territory –Morocco and Egypt – that did not exclusively
belong to either. Russia also was appeased for a
time. Inevitably, fears and hostilities in Europe
were raised. British foreign secretaries were well
aware of this and would have preferred it not tobe so. But Britain’s immediate interests wereplaced before international harmony. That is the
darker thread that ran through British policy.
During the last decade before the war Britain too
tended to follow Bismarckian Realpolitik. Just asit wanted to avoid imperial clashes with Russia, sotoo Britain feared that the entente with France
might not prove strong enough to prevent
Germany and France reaching a settlement of60SOCIAL CHANGE AND NATIONAL RIVALRY IN EUROPE, 1900–14

British policy was too com-promised to allow Grey, in the summer of 1914,
a strong mediating role. But, given German war
plans and the small size of the British army at the
outset, the hope that London might inﬂuencedecisively the course of events in Europe duringJuly 1914 was an illusion anyway.Nowhere were domestic political considera-
tions the decisive inﬂuence. The war was about

national power, and ambitions, and also fears as to
how national power would in the future be exer-
cised. Russia was not satisﬁed with its already huge
empire. France was conscious of its secondary
status in Europe which, if it were left without an
ally, would leave it at Germany’s mercy. Austria-
Hungary wished to annihilate Slav hostilitybeyond its frontiers. For imperial Germany, afuture in which its military power was no longer
superior to the combined military forces of its
potential enemies was not to be tolerated. Thishad to be averted by diplomacy or so-called ‘pre-
ventive’ war. Germany’s own diplomacy had con-
tributed much to the French and British feelings
of insecurity. It had ﬁnally placed Germany in the

unenviable position of being on bad relations with
its neighbours in the East and the West. Theworking out of the Schlieffen Plan saddled it withthe guilt of violating a small neutral state and with
the necessity to strike the ﬁrst blow, for it was

Germany who had to declare war in order to keep
to the timetable of the famous war plan. What the
coming of the war in 1914 reveals is how a lossof conﬁdence and fears for the future can be asdangerous to peace as the naked spirit of aggres-

sion that was to be the cause of the Second World
War a quarter of a century later. A handful of
European leaders in 1914 conceived national rela-
tionships crudely in terms of power and conﬂict,
and the future in terms of a struggle for survival
in competition for the world. For this, millions
had to suffer and die.1OVER THE BRINK61

BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTINGBALANCE OF GLOBAL POWEREuropean imperial dominance of much of theglobe, of Africa, of India and eastern Asia extend-
ing to China reached its zenith in the early twen-
tieth century, but already then was challenged.There were limits to further expansion. Europewas overextended, the US and Japan would
counter what they conceived as threats in their
own hemispheres and in the process run into con-
ﬂict with each other. They also followed their
own imperial roads.The emergence of the US as a superpower bythe mid-twentieth century is one of the most
striking changes of modern history. The state of
the American economy and America’s decision as
to where and in what manner to intervene in anypart of the globe have profoundly affected everycontinent. The US came to wield an inﬂuence
such as no other single nation has exercised
before. What is striking is that this impact on the
world has been so recent, scarcely pre-dating the
turn of the century. How did it come about andwhere are the roots of American world power?The growth of the population, and of theindustrial and agricultural production of the US,
were phenomenal. Their sustained increase
through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,overcoming two depressions in the mid-1870sand the mid-1890s as well as the serious depres-
sion of the 1930s, is one of the ‘economic
wonders’ of modern history. There was a con-
temporary awareness of America’s good fortune,and ‘growth’ was both expected and regarded asthe unique ‘American way’. When we comparethe population growth of the US with that of the
European great powers, we see clearly how rela-
tively sudden the transformation of the US intothe present-day colossus has been. In 1880 thetotal population of the US was about the same as
Germany’s ten years later and only 5 million more
than Germany’s at the same time. Thus, in pop-
ulation the US only just ranked in the same
league as the largest of the European nations.But, from then on, the US’s rapid outdistancingof previously comparable countries was one fun-
damental reason for the emergence of the US as
a superpower.A crucial factor in this growth of populationwas another feature of the New World, the large-scale emigration from Europe. Driven largely by
poverty and the hope of a better life a great mass
of humanity ﬂooded into the US, more than 13
million between 1900 and 1914 alone. Most of
them were peasants from central and southernEurope. The majority of these ‘new immigrants’(to distinguish them from the ‘old’ immigrants
from Britain, Ireland, Germany and Scandinavia)1Chapter 5THE EMERGENCE OF THE US AS A WORLD POWERPopulation (millions)1880190019201930

settled in the towns where they preferred to join their countrymen who had kept closetogether in the cities and found unskilled indus-
trial work. Immigrants contributed signiﬁcantly
to the growth of major cities, reinforced eco-
nomic expansion and helped to bring about themass market which is characteristic of twentieth-century America. Of the 13 million, more than a
million were Jews leaving the pogrom-ridden
Russian Empire; they helped to make New York
into one of the great clothing manufacturing
centres of America.The rich cultural variety of the US, the diver-sity of ethnic groups from the West and the East,
as well as the sheer numbers of immigrants, are
among the unique features of America’s national
growth. America, as one historian put it, was lessa ‘melting pot’ – intermarriage and common alle-giances did not speedily obliterate national differ-
ences of origin – than a ‘salad bowl’. All the same,
the fusion of peoples of every national origin and
religion and, over a much longer period, thefusion of races black and white, Asian andHispanic into a national community has proved amore powerful force than national and racial dif-
ferences and conﬂict.In the twentieth century the shared experi-ences of two world wars were powerful inﬂuencesin making for more toleration and mutual accep-tance – one of the most signiﬁcant aspects of the
development of the US for world history.The immigrants added immensely to the vital-ity of the US. Starting from nothing, they and
their descendants acquired new skills and an edu-cation. The US was the country where the acci-dent of a father’s social status mattered least in the
Western world. As far as the African Americans
were concerned, this generalisation did not hold
true. As long ago as 1868 some of the framers ofthe fourteenth amendment of the constitutionsought to protect the rights of black people. The
amendment declared that Americans enjoyed
equal rights and equality before the law, and
speciﬁcally laid down that no state could ‘deprive66BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTING BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER
Immigrants waiting in America. © Bettmann/Corbisany person of life, liberty, or property, withoutdue process of law’. However, as a protection ofthe civil rights of African Americans, the four-
teenth amendment proved worthless because it
was not enforced. It was used instead by the rising
industrialists and ﬁnanciers to amass greater for-tunes and inﬂuence through combinations andmergers.The age distribution of the immigrants andtheir tendency to have larger families than the
American-born kept the increase of population at
a much higher level than could otherwise be sus-tained. America was in reality, and in self-image,a young country constantly renewing itself. At the
turn of the century, the US had just recovered
from the depression of the mid-1890s, and
Americans faced the twentieth century with muchoptimism believing, rightly as it turned out, thattheir country was on the threshold of indus-
trial expansion and the accumulation of wealth.
Between 1900 and 1914 manufacturing produc-
tion nearly doubled and overtook agriculture asthe main source of national wealth. The tradi-tional America was a nation of farmers, artisans
and small businessmen. The America of the twen-
tieth century was predominantly industrial, with
the growth of cities, and railways linking the
industrial Midwest and the east. Industry wasincreasingly dominated by the giant corpora-tions such as John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil
Company or the Trusts of J. Pierpont Morgan,
though small businesses also persisted. The
absolute growth of population, the opening up ofvirgin lands in the west, made possible simulta-neously a great expansion of agricultural output
despite the population movement to the towns.
This increasing output was more than enough to
feed the growing American population and leave
sufficient to export. Meat packing and foodcanning became important industries. The vastcontinent of the US was singularly blessed in all
its resources – fertile land, forests, coal, iron and
oil. Their simultaneous successful development
provided the dynamic of American economicgrowth which no European nation could match,and meant that Americans were less dependent on
imports or exports than any other advanced
Western nation.In the early twentieth century, American busi-ness nevertheless expanded American exports toindustrialised Europe, seeing this as a necessary
insurance against a glut in the market at home –
yet these exports were only a small proportion of
America’s total production, which was protectedat home by a high tariff. In the early twentiethcentury the application of electricity as a new
energy source provided a further boost, and elec-
trical machinery together with automobiles –
Henry Ford alone producing 125,000 cars a year
by 1913, half the nation’s total output – were the‘new industries’ maintaining America’s lead as theworld’s ﬁrst industrial power.America’s explosive growth was not achievedwithout severe political and social tensions. This
was the other side of the optimism expressed at theturn of the century about the future. People beganto ask who would control the destinies of the US.
Would it be the new breed of immensely success-

ful and wealthy ﬁnanciers and businessmen? Was
not their inﬂuence already the main reason for the
corruption of government, no longer a govern-
ment for and by the people but for the good of
business? The cleavage between the rich and poor
appeared to widen as the Vanderbilts, Morgans,
Rockefellers and Harrimans displayed their wealth.The western farmers were exposed to thevagaries of the seasons and also to the increasesand falls of world grain prices. A good harvest
could drive the prices farther down and the
farmers seeking a cause for their misfortunes
focused on the high interest they had to pay onthe loans they needed – the result, as they saw it,of government dominated by the industrial east.
The southern US remained relatively stagnant,
unable to diversify when, after the worldwide
drop in cotton prices, cotton could no longer
yield the same proﬁt as before the civil war.The American workers in the mines and fac-tories also tried to organise to meet the increased
power of business. Socialism as a political force
had developed in the US as well as in Europe
during the nineteenth century, and for a shortwhile after 1872 the headquarters of Marx’s FirstInternational was in New York. But the Socialist
Labor Party of North America could not estab-
lish itself as a serious force in politics. In the early1THE EMERGENCE OF THE US AS A WORLD POWER67
twentieth century, under the charismatic leader-ship of Eugene V. Debs, the Social DemocraticParty attempted to win over the worker from
trade union economic bargaining to politics, but
was unsuccessful on a national scale, though
Debs, when he became a presidential candidate,secured almost 900,000 votes. When labourunions expanded it was under the direction of
men like Samuel Gompers who rejected political
socialism as utopian and saw themselves as prac-
tical men seeking to improve the wages and con-
ditions of labour day by day without ulterior endsin view. In 1886 they organised the AmericanFederation of Labor (AFL) but in the 1890s
found that union militancy could not prevail
against the employers supported by the federal
government. There were some successes to setagainst the failures, with the gradual introductionof maximum working hours and the ending of 
the abuse of child labour. Theodore Roosevelt,
when president, showed more sympathy for the
workers. Strikes of national concern, like the coalstrike in Pennsylvania in 1902, were no longersettled by the federal government siding with the
employers. President Roosevelt intervened and
refused to back the mine owners, who had to
concede higher wages. Roosevelt’s action was
characteristic of one aspect of a new spirit collec-tively known as the Progressive Movement.But Roosevelt’s outlook was not shared by allthe states, which had retained extensive rights
under the constitution. In 1903 and 1904 the
governor of the state of Colorado, for instance,had mobilised the militia, jailed the union leadersof the striking copper miners and beaten down
the strikes with violence and bloodshed; and in all
this he was eventually supported by the Supreme
Court. Gompers himself was imprisoned by
federal courts after another strike and denouncedas a dangerous rabble-rouser subverting the law.Against this onslaught of employers, and with
business dominating the courts and the state gov-
ernments, Roosevelt could do little. Though the
AFL expanded from half a million to 2 millionmembers by 1914, it could scarcely hold its own. Only the boom brought about by the Great
War and the shortage of labour enabled the 
more moderate unions to gain acceptance and tonegotiate better terms for workers. But the massof the unskilled and black people remained largelyoutside the unions. The AFL’s successes were
mainly won on behalf of the skilled craft unions
and the semi-skilled.After the depressed 1880s and mid-1890s thefarmers, who had been a major force behind therising challenge to eastern business dominance,
became quiescent. From 1897 until 1914 they
enjoyed a short ‘golden age’ of prosperity, the
value of their crops doubling during this period.Looking at the US as a whole, the only safegeneralisation is that the problems that forcedthemselves on the attention of people varied enor-
mously from one region to another, as did the
responses of those in power in any particular state.
Thus, in contrast to the conduct of Colorado’sgovernment, the governor of Wisconsin, RobertM. La Follette, passed many practical reforms in
his state, as did Woodrow Wilson after becoming
governor of New Jersey in 1911.‘Progressive’ became a loose label denotinglittle more than a recognition of the many variedills besetting American society and politics during
years of rapid change and a desire to remedy
whichever of these ills a particular progressive felt
to be the most injurious. The ills were well pub-
licised by a new breed of journalists who proudlyaccepted what was meant to be an insultingdescription of their work – ‘The Muckrakers’.
Their targets were manifold – political corruption,
the inequality of wealth, the domination of
politics by big business; they investigated mostaspects of American life; they attacked the doc-trine of freedom which allowed the grasping
entrepreneur to develop America at too great a
price; they stressed the undermining of democ-
racy; and argued the need for more regulatory
government, not less.In domestic politics the president’s powers arelimited by the rights of the two Houses of Con-

gress, the Senate and the House of Representa-

tives, and by the Supreme Court, the ﬁnal arbiter

of any dispute about constitutional rights. WhatPresident Theodore Roosevelt and his successors –the more conservative William Howard Taft, and
then the Democrat Woodrow Wilson – actually
achieved in legislation was less important than the68BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTING BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER
fact that the presidency gave a reforming lead andso helped to change the climate of American pub-
lic opinion. The Progressives were successful in the
passage of child-labour laws in over forty states,
and of laws governing the working conditions of
women, but their attempts to clean up politics andsmash the power of party machines failed. Lack ofsupervision to ensure enforcement also weakened
much of the social legislation passed. After the
Great War was over, in 1919, one reform dear to
many Progressives, Prohibition (of alcoholic
drinks), was enacted by Congress nationwide.Here, too, a large gap soon became apparentbetween law and actual observance.Theodore Roosevelt was the ﬁrst president of the
US to play a role as world statesman. As in hisdomestic policy, where he was inhibited by polit-
ical constraints, so in his ‘world’ diplomacy he was
circumscribed by America’s lack of military power
and the unwillingness of American people to make
sacriﬁces to back up a ‘large’ American foreign pol-
icy. Superﬁcially Roosevelt succeeded in drawinginternational attention to the US and to his own
role as diplomatist. In this respect his greatest
achievement was to act in 1905 as mediator
between the Japanese and Russians and to host the
peace conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire,ending the Russo-Japanese War. The US nextplayed a part in the international Moroccan con-

ference at Algeciras in 1906. The following year, in
a characteristically ostentatious gesture, Roosevelt
sent the newly constructed US navy on a worldcruise to show the ﬂag. Roosevelt made America’s
presence felt. But what really lay behind these
great-power posturings was apprehension that the
conditions that had given the US security for the
past century were passing away.For this feeling, which actually anticipateddangers that still lay in the future, there were twoprincipal reasons: the likely direction of European
imperialism and the consequences of America’s
own ﬂirtation with imperialism at the turn of the
century. Both can be seen clearly at work duringthe course of a war just won, the ‘splendid little’Spanish–American war of 1898.The American response to European imperial-ism, which had led to the partition of Africa andChina, was to try to anticipate a serious challengeto the Monroe Doctrine, with its declaration ofUS opposition to any further European colonial
extension within the western hemisphere. What if
the Europeans next sought to extend their inﬂu-
ence in the Caribbean and Central America andso surrounded the US with armed bases? CaptainA. T. Mahan, in his day the most inﬂuential writer
and proponent of the importance of sea power,
was writing at this time that such a danger did
exist since crucial strategic regions of signiﬁcance
in world trade would inevitably become areas ofgreat-power rivalry. One such artery of tradewould be the canal (later Panama Canal) which 
it was planned to construct across the isthmus 
of Central America. The backward and weak 
independent Caribbean island states were alsoeasy prey for any intending European imperi-alist. The island of Cuba, lying close to the main-
land of Florida was, then as now, a particularly
sensitive spot. Before the war with Spain, Cuba
was a Spanish colony, in chronic rebellion andanarchy. The war on the island was barbarous as most guerrilla wars are apt to be, and American
opinion, genuinely humanitarian, was inﬂamed by
the popular ‘yellow’ press. But the hidden aspect
of the situation as seen by the administration was
that a weak Spain as the sovereign power on theisland might be replaced by an aggressive Britainor Germany.A group of Americans, including a number ofsenior naval ofﬁcers, Theodore Roosevelt (then
an up-and-coming politician) and Senator HenryCabot Lodge, discussed ways and means of takingprecautionary action before these dangers materi-
alised. They were later seen as ‘imperialists’ or
‘expansionists’ and indeed this was the practical
outcome of their ideas, but their motivation was
essentially defensive – to preserve American secu-rity in the coming conditions of the twentiethcentury.Imperialism was inextricably bound up withthis defensive attitude. The Americans intervened
and made themselves the gendarmes of theCaribbean. After the war with Spain in 1898,Cuba, though proclaimed an independent repub-
lic, became a virtual protectorate of the US. A US
naval base was constructed on the island and the1THE EMERGENCE OF THE US AS A WORLD POWER69
land needed for it was ceded to the US. ThisAmerican presence was intended to ensure thatno European power could take over Cuba or
reach the inner naval defences of the US before
meeting the US navy in the western Atlantic. 
The US also imposed conditions on Cuba whichallowed the US to intervene in case of internaldiscord. Another Caribbean island, Puerto Rico,
was simply annexed for similar strategic reasons.
In 1904 Theodore Roosevelt extended the right
of the US to act as a policeman throughout
Central and Latin America, invoking the MonroeDoctrine as justiﬁcation. By helping the Pana-manian revolutionaries against Colombia in 1903,
Roosevelt established another American protec-
torate in all but name in the new state of Panama.
Nor did the US hesitate to intervene in the inde-pendent republics of Dominica and Nicaragua.Although Woodrow Wilson, when he became
president, attempted to revert to the earlier spirit
of inter-American collaboration, he did not
himself hesitate to intervene in Mexico from 1914to 1916.In contrast to the advanced industrialised andagriculturally developed North American conti-
nent, the habitable regions of South America sup-
ported a growing population in, for the most
part, abject poverty. (For a fuller discussion ofLatin America see Part XIV.) The descendants ofthe Spaniards and Portuguese and the immigrants
from Europe who formed the minority of inhab-
itants enjoyed the wealth and political power of
the American ‘republics’. There was much varietyin the politics and society of Latin America. Theirrevolutions, though, had been revolutions from
above in the early nineteenth century. The new
states remained authoritarian, despite their elab-
orate constitutions modelled on the French or
American, and their professed ideals of democ-racy, with a few notable exceptions, proved afaçade for governments based on force: they were
governments of the generals or of dictators who
commanded the military forces of the state.
Violence was the language of politics. Trade with Europe, especially (in the later nineteenthcentury) with Britain and Germany, was consid-
erably greater than with the US, to which there
was much hostility, on account of its claims topre-eminence in the Americas. The possibility of‘Yankee’ interference was the object of particularLatin American suspicion and animosity.In 1900 strategic planners in the US clearly sawthe discrepancy between the pretensions of theMonroe Doctrine and the inability of the US toexert any military and naval inﬂuence south of the
Amazon in Brazil. What if the partition of Africa
were followed by European domination of South
and Central America? In fact, the conflicts in
Europe, the Mediterranean and Near East, inAfrica and in Asia absorbed the military resourcesof the European Western powers. Britain, the
major European power with colonies and com-
mercial interests in Latin America and an empire
extending from colonies in the Caribbean to theDominion of Canada in the north, furthermoremade clear its intention not to challenge the US’s
claim for regional supremacy. At the turn of the
twentieth century Britain and the US signed 
the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty which granted the USthe sole right of defence of the future PanamaCanal. This was followed by Britain withdrawing
its ﬂeet from the Caribbean and settling all out-
standing disputes with the US. Britain could not
afford to risk the enmity of the US as well when its
interests were more endangered at home, ﬁrst byRussia then by Germany, in the Mediterranean, in Asia and in Europe. And so a war between
Britain and the US became increasingly unthink-
able as the twentieth century progressed. In this
way the conﬂicts of the European powers in theearly years of the twentieth century continued toserve the security of the US in its hemisphere.But in the Paciﬁc and eastern Asia the USbecame more deeply involved and exposed. 
US interests in the trade of China date back to
the foundations of the American republic itself.Not until the close of the nineteenth century,however, did the US acquire a territorial stake in
the Paciﬁc. The annexation of Hawaii in 1898
could still just about be ﬁtted in with the notion
that the island was an essential offshore base ofdefence for the western seaboard of the US.There could be no such claim for the annexation
of the Philippines after the Spanish–American
War of 1898. An American army crushed the70BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTING BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER

AsunciónThe AmericasFilipino struggle for independence (1899–1902).This was imperialism. The US staked its claim fora share of the China market whose potential was
overestimated. The appearance of the US in
eastern Asia as a Western colonial power aroused
the alarm of Japan and marks the origins of a newconﬂict in eastern Asia in the twentieth century.Theodore Roosevelt had recognised that the
Philippines were indefensible; they were, to use
his words, America’s ‘heel of Achilles’.In the military sense, America’s role as a worldpower was potential rather than actual during theﬁrst decade and a half of the twentieth century.The American army was small – adequate to deal
with Indians and Mexicans; its warships in the
1880s had been called in Congress a collection of
washtubs. How soon the US could turn militarypotential into reality is illustrated by the amaz-ingly rapid construction of the modern US navy.
In the 1890s American naval power was puny,
just enough to cope with Spain’s antiquated war-
ships; by 1920, the US navy could match theBritish. But to exercise world power requires notonly the means – and no one could doubt in theearly twentieth century America’s capacity – butalso the will. Before 1914, it did not seem realis-
tic to suppose that the US would become
involved in war over the conﬂicts of the other
Western powers. The American people saw noneed for war. The large navy, which could ensurethe security of the North American continent and
its approaches, and the small professional army,
indeed, point to the overwhelmingly defensive
attitude of the US. Nevertheless, it was drawn to
war in 1917. But it was only with great reluctancethat Americans came to accept that the US’s cir-cumstances had fundamentally changed from the
times of the Founding Fathers and their advice
that the US should not entangle its fortunes in
the rivalries of Europe. The war that had begunin Europe three years earlier spread to every continent and turned into the ﬁrst global war. 
In eastern Asia Japan emerging as a strong mili-
tary power took advantage of Europe’s distress.
China’s disintegration was Japan’s opportunity.China’s efforts to modernise came too late.72BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTING BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER
About one-ﬁfth of humanity lives in China, themost populous nation of the world. But until the
nineteenth century, though in touch with the
West, China followed its own path of historicaldevelopment unaffected by Western contact. Thechronological cycle of eastern Asian developments
did not coincide with that of Europe, nor did the
First World War mark the great break of ‘before’
and ‘after’ in Chinese history. The war simply
intensiﬁed the ongoing disintegration.The hugeness of China in land area and population makes it all the more extraordinary
that for more than a thousand years a concept of
unity had been maintained. Other peoples were
absorbed as China expanded. The ethnic originof some of these peoples survives to the presentday in the form of national minorities with which
about one in eighteen Chinese identify – though
intermarriage has obliterated the majority. In tra-
ditional China, to be considered Chinese was not
a matter of race or nationality in the Westernsense but depended on an acceptance of Chinesecustoms and culture. Those who did not accept
them – even people within Chinese frontiers –
were considered ‘barbarian’. The living traditions
of Chinese culture were so strong that theyabsorbed the alien peoples who conquered Chinaand so turned them into Chinese. These included
the Mongol dynasty and, in the mid-seventeenth
century, the Manchus who ruled from then until
the revolution of 1911 as the Ch’ing dynasty.Foreign peoples were incorporated by conquestor else absorbed by China when they conqueredthe empire from without. The political and cul-
tural continuity of China persisted, overcoming
periods of internal rebellion and war. Integration,not disintegration, was the dominant theme ofmore than a millennium of Chinese history until
the mid-nineteenth century. But how should his-
torians interpret the century that followed?If we stop the clock in 1925 it would certainlyseem that the disintegration of China had pro-ceeded so far that the long tradition of thenational unity of the Chinese Empire could never
be restored. It was then a country torn by internal
strife, economically bound to the West and Japan,
yet without signiﬁcant progress, as far as the massof Chinese were concerned, to show for Westerneconomic penetration, politically divided, and
with parts of China dominated by foreign powers.
From the later Ch’ing period in the 1840s until
the close of the civil war in 1949, China knew no
peace and passed through a number of phases ofdisintegration which no single ruler who followedthe Ch’ing dynasty after 1911 could halt. Today,
the Chinese Empire is uniﬁed once more and has
reasserted its right to recover territories that were
once Chinese or over which suzerainty wasasserted.In the nineteenth century a double crisis threat-ened the cohesion and stability of China and
undermined traditional China and the rule of theCh’ing dynasty. A great blow to central authority1Chapter 6CHINA IN DISINTEGRATION, 1900–29
was the defeat of the Manchu Ch’ing dynasty bythe invasion of the ‘barbarians’ of the West. TheWest saw an opportunity to trade in China and
made wars to force their way in. The British
fought the Opium Wars (1839–42) and China
ceded its territory (Hong Kong) and was forced toaccept the opening of its trade to Britain. An evenmore fundamental cause of unrest was that popu-
lation growth was no longer matched by an
increase in the lands under cultivation. Amid the
general distress occurred the greatest rising in
world history – the Taiping Rebellion of 1850–64which led to huge destruction and to the loss ofbetween 20 and 30 million lives. The rising was
mastered in the end by gentry-led regional armies.
China was thereby pushed along a path where
regional independence and strength assertedthemselves against central authority. During thisperiod and later in the nineteenth century other
Western nations followed the British example and
secured concessions; and so began a process
whereby the Western powers acquired territorialsettlements, colonies, leases, rights to trade in‘treaty ports’, and concessions in some eighty
towns on the coast and inland. The foreigners not
only enjoyed immunity from Chinese government
but in their settlements, in effect, ruled over the
Chinese inhabitants as well. The largest, the for-eign settlements of Shanghai, in 1928 comprised aChinese population of more than 1 million subor-
dinated to 35,000 Westerners. China was not only
defeated and forced to accept the ‘unequal
treaties’ by the West, but during the last decade of the nineteenth century was attacked by Japan aswell.The impact of the West and Japan, as well asChina’s internal upheavals, led Chinese intellec-
tuals to question China’s future role. Yet their
initial reaction was to seek to preserve Chinesetraditions. China should strengthen itself throughthe adoption of Western industrial and military
techniques. But little real headway could be made
materially. It was not Confucian tradition that
blocked the path but economic reality. Chinaremained a peasant society with a surface scratchof industrial development, largely in the foreign-
dominated enclaves. The movement of ‘self-
strengthening’ was nowhere near sufficient tocounter the forces of disintegration. The Ch’ingdynasty under the formidable Empress DowagerTz’u-hsi attempted in a last spasm to adopt
Western techniques in government and educa-
tion, but always with the underlying conservative
purpose of strengthening traditional China. Thereforms were undertaken in the wake of the dis-astrous Boxer rising of 1900, which attempted to
throw out Western inﬂuence – economic, polit-
ical, territorial and religious – by force and was,
in its turn, crushed by a Western international
army joined by the Japanese. China was placedfurther in debt to the West and lost control overeven more territory since the Russians refused to
leave northern China and Manchuria. Then the
Chinese had to stand aside as Russia and Japan in
1904 and 1905 fought each other for dominanceover this portion of China. China was breakingapart into foreign spheres of inﬂuence; simulta-
neously the regions were asserting their auton-
omy from central government. In 1908 the
empress died and the strength of the Ch’ingdynasty was spent. If the misery of the conditionof the country and its people could prove such a
thing, then the Ch’ing dynasty had lost its
Heavenly Mandate.Among the small group of conservative intellec-tuals and administrators there were some who,under the impact of the experience of their own
lifetime, looked at the world beyond China more
realistically and knowledgeably. They contrasted
Japanese success in maintaining national inde-
pendence, in throwing off discriminatory treatiesin their homeland and in inﬂicting military defeat
on a great Western power with China’s weakness
and helplessness. China had, in theory, preserved
its sovereignty over all but small portions of its
empire. The reality, however, was different sinceforeigners controlled its commerce, built its rail-ways and established industries under their own-
ership. Here, though, it is necessary to distinguish
the few Westerners who were dedicated to serving
the interests of China as they saw them. Thesewere officials like Robert Hart, head of theMaritime Customs Service, who warned in the
aftermath of the Boxer rising that the Western
powers should take care how they treated the74BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTING BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER
Chinese: ‘a China in arms will be a big power atsome future day’, he wrote; the Western powersshould make sure that ‘the China of the future
might have something to thank us for and not to
avenge’. There were some Chinese reformers who
sensed that China stood at the parting of theways. China could emulate Japan or suffer the fateof India and south-east Asia, then part of the
colonial empires of the Dutch, the British and the
French.Many of these reformers had received part oftheir education in Japan or the West. Yan Fu, oneof the most important, spent time not only inJapan but also in England. In his writings he con-

trasted the Chinese ideals of harmony and stability
with Western encouragement of the thrusting indi-

vidual, competition and the goal of progress. YanFu translated into Chinese seminal Western workson politics and the economy, books by T. H.
Huxley, John Stuart Mill and Adam Smith among
them. His translations and his own advocacy stim-

ulated demands for a break with Confucian tradi-
tions and the adoption of a Western-style form ofconstitutional government. Another reformer of
great inﬂuence in the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth
century was Liang Qichao, the intellectual leader
of the young Chinese progressives, who wrote
extensively about Western political leaders andthinkers in the hope of opening up a new world to the Chinese and thus transforming them into 
a new people. In its last years, not so much dir-
ectly inﬂuenced by the reformers but reacting to
the same stimuli – a desire to strengthen Chinaagainst the foreigner – the Ch’ing dynasty pro-mulgated reforms thick and fast, promising the
gradual introductionofconstitutionalgovernment,

a process which when set in motion was to lead 
to its own downfall and the revolution of 1911.Thousands of students in the ﬁrst decade of the
twentieth century travelled and studied abroad.Their ideas were far more radical than those of the
reformers. Their goal was a revolution against 
the ‘foreign’ Ch’ing dynasty and the establish-
ment of a republic. They identiﬁed with another
Western-educated revolutionary, Dr Sun Yat-sen.A farmer’s son, like many Chinese he had emi-

grated abroad joining, at the age of twelve, his
brothers in Hawaii. He was educated in a Britishmissionary school there and, later, in Hong Kong,where he graduated in medicine. He did not practise long as a doctor, instead seeing that his
task was to awaken China to revolution. In breach
of Chinese tradition, Sun Yat-sen encouraged 
the Chinese to view themselves as a distinctiverace. The removal of the foreign Manchu Ch’ingdynasty provided a focus for the revolutionary
movement. Sun Yat-sen wished to create a
modern Chinese nation state, with a constitution
based on that of the US together with some
Chinese traditions grafted on to it such as acontrol branch of government – the old censorsunder a new name. In Japan he founded the rev-

olutionary League of Common Alliance, an organ-

ised political movement which in 1912 joined
with other groups to form the Kuomintang orNationalist Party. Not until after his death in1925, however, did the Kuomintang play a
leading role in China’s history.Sun Yat-sen summed up his political pro-
gramme and aims in three principles: ﬁrst, therestoration of the Chinese identity, which cameto mean the removal of both the ‘foreign’
Manchu dynasty and foreign imperialism. China,
Sun Yat-sen said, lacked a national spirit; the 400
million people of China were ‘just a heap of loose
sand’, and China the weakest and poorest nation– ‘other men are the carving knife and servingdish; we are the ﬁsh and meat’. China must seek
its salvation by espousing nationalism and so avert
the catastrophe of ‘China being lost and our
people being eliminated’. The foreign oppression,he pointed out, was not just political, which waseasily recognised, but economic, transforming
China ‘into a colony of the foreign powers’. The
second principle was democracy, by which he
meant the creation of a strong executive central
power and the ultimate sovereignty of the peopleexpressed in an electoral process. The third prin-ciple, socialism, was the vaguest; in theory it
stood for landownership equalisation and some
state control to prevent the abuse of monopoly
capitalist power, but since the Kuomintang drewsupport from businessmen, the principle wasblurred. Sun Yat-sen developed these ideas
throughout his political life, though in his own
lifetime they found little application.1CHINA IN DISINTEGRATION, 1900–2975
The advocates of Westernisation always facedone serious emotional and intellectual problem.The very people they wished to emulate showed
their belief in Chinese inferiority. Foreign resi-
dents, whether missionaries or merchants, only
too frequently looked down on the Chinese,regarding their culture as pagan. The roles of thecivilised and the barbarians were reversed. In
Shanghai there were parks reserved exclusively for
the Westerners, characteristic of the racial preju-
dice of the time. The Christian missionaries saw
themselves engaged in saving souls otherwise lostto heathen ways. So the Chinese reacted toWestern ways with both admiration and intense
hostility. The political and economic behaviour of
the Western powers could only strengthen that
hostility.The course of the revolution of 1911, whichsoon ended the monarchy, was not determined by
Sun Yat-sen, though a Chinese Republic did come
into being. A strong Chinese nation dedicated to
the objectives of his loose Alliance movement didnot emerge when the revolution had succeeded inits ﬁrst task of overthrowing the Manchus. The
membership of Sun Yat-sen’s party amounted to
only a few thousand within China. More signiﬁ-
cant in determining the subsequent course of
events were the men of inﬂuence in the provinces– the merchants and the gentry – who took advan-tage of constitutional reform to assert the inde-
pendence of the provinces in the newly elected
assemblies. The spark for starting the revolution
was provided by a rising of a small group of revo-
lutionary soldiers in Wuchang in central China inOctober 1911 with only the weakest links with
Sun Yat-sen’s Alliance. Sun Yat-sen at the time
was in Denver in the US. The rising could easily
have been suppressed. But so weak had the power
of the central government become that provinceafter province in October and November 1911declared its independence from the central court
government. Hostility to the dynasty was wide-
spread. The court turned to Yuan Shikai, recently
a governor-general of a northern province, wherehe had built up a modern Chinese NorthernArmy.Yuan Shikai was in retirement when the revo-lution broke out; the dynasty saw him now as theonly man considered capable of commanding theloyalty of the officers of the Northern Army,whose military strength might still re-establish the
dynasty’s authority. Yuan Shikai, however, was
determined to be his own master. He negotiated
with the revolutionaries. They agreed to hisassuming the presidency of the Chinese Republicprovided he could secure the abdication of the
Ch’ing dynasty. In February 1912 the abdication
decree was published and in March 1912 Yuan
Shikai became the ﬁrst president of China as the
man most acceptable to the provincial gentry andmerchants. These men were basically conserva-tive, and Sun Yat-sen’s revolutionary movement
was abhorrent to them. There was to be no social
revolution. The republic and its new parliament
representing the unity of China were frail institu-tions. During the last four years of Yuan Shikai’slife, from 1912 to 1916, he ruled more and more
as a military dictator through the army and,
shortly before his death, attempted to revive the
monarchy with himself as emperor. Through hishold over the army, the provinces were unable toassert complete independence from Peking. But
Yuan Shikai could establish no genuine national
unity and with his death the disintegration of
China accelerated.The years from 1906 to 1928 mark the warlordera in modern Chinese history. To the outside
world the Republic of China was governed from
Peking. In reality this was just one of the hundreds
of governments, each headed by a warlord with apersonal army which had gained control of an areasometimes small, sometimes covering a whole
province. The warlords intrigued and fought each
other in constant wars throughout twelve years of
strife and bloodshed. The peasants suffered from
pillage, tax oppression, destruction of their prop-erty and bloodshed. But during this bleak perioda continuous process of state-building also took
place.This same period saw some other positivedevelopments. The combination of China’s mis-fortunes internal and external welded together anew national movement which tried to recapture
the objectives set by Sun Yat-sen but totally
disregarded after the revolution of 1911.76BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTING BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER
Foreign encroachments on Chinese integrityprovoked the strongest reaction among the youngstudents and intellectuals. Peking University
became the centre of the intellectual ferment and
participated in what became known as the New
Culture Movement. Japan’s Twenty-one Demandsin January 1915 took advantage of the preoccupa-tion of the European powers with winning the war
in Europe to demand of the Chinese government
its practical subordination to Japan. In China they
were met with a storm of protest. An even greater
outburst of indignation greeted the decisions of theParis Peace Conference in 1919. China was an ally,yet Japan had been accorded the right to take over
Germany’s extensive concessions in the province of
Shantung, and the warlord government in Peking,
representing China, had accepted this transfer of what was after all still Chinese territory.The fourth of May 1919 is an important datein the history of modern China. It was later seen
as marking the moment when China reasserted its
national identity once more in angry response toimperialism. Some 3,000 students in PekingUniversity launched a national protest movement
which took its name from that date. The govern-
ment had arrested some students and the protest
was directed equally against the government and
national humiliation. In the burst of publicationsthat followed, the May the Fourth movement hada powerful effect on stimulating the young intel-
lectuals to reject the social and political traditions
of old China, including the Confucian ideals of
duty and ﬁlial obedience and the subordinationof women. A boycott of Japanese goods, in turn,led to the organisation of Chinese labour in the
ports. But the intellectual revolution also had a
divisive effect as the mass of the countryside and
the peasantry was virtually untouched by the fever
for change.In 1923 Sun Yat-sen was looking for ways tostrengthen his enfeebled Kuomintang Party,
which was nominally ruling Canton but in reality
was dependent on the local warlord. He turned
for help to the tiny Communist Party, numberingless than a thousand members. The Cominternwelcomed any opportunity to strike a blow against
Western imperialism and agents were sent from
Moscow. The cooperation of Sun Yat-sen and hisRussian advisers soon bore fruit. Sun Yat-senadapted his principles to the new situation and theComintern ordered the Chinese communists not
to form an alliance but to subordinate their inter-
ests and fuse with the Kuomintang. The commu-
nists, now forming the left wing of the Kuo-mintang, never lost their sense of identity. Theparty, with the help of Russian advice, was reor-
ganised, and communist inﬂuence among Chinese
labour working for Western interests rapidly grew;
strikes were fomented and supported. In the
countryside, too, the Kuomintang made headwayamong the peasants in encouraging the seizure oflandlord’s land.The right wing of the Kuomintang controlledthe national revolutionary army it was organising.
The task was assigned to one of Sun Yat-sen’s loyal young followers, Chiang Kai-shek. In 1923Chiang Kai-shek went to Moscow to study the
new Soviet Red Army. On his return he was placed
in charge of training the ofﬁcers of the Kuomin-
tang’s revolutionary army. In 1925 Sun Yat-sendied. There was no obvious successor. For a timethe party continued under a collective leadership
amid increasing strains between the left and the
right. But Chiang Kai-shek soon made clear his
opposition to the left of the Kuomintang. Chiang
Kai-shek turned against the socialist plans of hiscommunist allies. He also vied for the assistance ofthe propertied and for help from the West. Mean-
while the communists in following Moscow’s
orders fared disastrously. In April 1927 the
nationalists and their supporters crushed organ-ised workers in Shanghai and shot protesters. Inthe countryside peasant risings were bloodily put
down. By the end of that year the break between
the communists and nationalists was complete.
Driven out of the towns, the communists estab-
lished base areas in remote regions. Mao Zedong,then in his thirties, created the most important inJiangxi. Here the Red Army was trained by Zhou
Enlai and taught to help and not plunder the peas-
ants. Other signiﬁcant reforms ended the sale of
girls into forced marriages, while the peasants’greatest need was land reform. After ﬁve years,surrounded by Chiang’s forces, the base became
untenable. Daringly at night on 16 October 1934,
leaving behind a rearguard and the sick and1CHINA IN DISINTEGRATION, 1900–2977
wounded, the communists broke through theencirclement and fought their way north for 6,000
miles on the epic ‘Long March’. Yet it was not
civil war that dominated the 1930s but the
Japanese invasion in 1937. Once more, ferventnational feelings created a sense of unity in resist-ing the brutal aggressor. Before Chiang Kai-shek’s
decisive breach he utilised the strength of the
communists to support the northern military
expedition started in 1926 to convert what was alocal government into a national one. It was atremendous feat to sweep successfully north from
their base in southern China to Peking. There was
some hard fighting; some warlords agreed to
accept Chiang Kai-shek’s authority on behalf ofthe nationalist government now established in anew capital in Nanking.Chiang Kai-shek took care at this stage not tooffend the Western powers in China. He smashed
the anti-Western movement of the communists in78BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTING BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER

He set himself as his ﬁrst taskto gain military control over China. But, thoughhis success had been astonishing, he had not
broken the power of all the warlords and by the
close of the 1920s controlled less than half of
China. In 1930 he quelled a rising in the northin large-scale battles. Thereafter the remainingwarlords and Chiang Kai-shek’s government
agreed to tolerate each other. China was moreuniﬁed, but a new military struggle was openingup between the Kuomintang and the commu-nists. Simultaneously Japan took advantage of
China’s weakness to seize Manchuria in 1931. In
the end Chiang Kai-shek, faced with the Japanese
war and simultaneous civil conﬂict with the com-munists, failed to create the national unity ofChina which was Sun Yat-sen’s testament to his
followers.1CHINA IN DISINTEGRATION, 1900–2979
The continent of Asia can be divided into threeregions, each in a different relationship to the
West. Southern and south-east Asia was, by theclose of the nineteenth century, partitioned by the European powers and the US and constituted
the most populous and important parts of the
Western world empires. In eastern Asia, China
had fallen under a different kind of Westerncontrol, remaining semi-independent, but withlarge areas under foreign economic control, while
some parts of China had also fallen under foreign
territorial control. Also part of eastern Asia were
the islands of Japan.Japan’s history is strikingly different from therest of Asia. Japan had been forced open by the American warships of Commodore Perry 
in the mid-nineteenth century and exposed to the
pressures of the Western powers backed by guns.
They refused to permit Japan to follow its owncourse in isolation and demanded, as a Westernright, that Japan open its markets to trade with
the West. The rulers of Japan, the Tokugawa
shoguns, could not match the military power of
the West and so had to concede. After 200 years
of virtual isolation, imposed by the shoguns toprotect it from Western inﬂuence, Japan then layexposed and virtually helpless. Like China, it was
forced to accede to ‘unequal treaties’, providing
Western merchants with economic advantages
and special territorial privileges which set asideJapan’s sovereign rights but, unlike China, wasallowed to ban opium. Half a century later, by theearly twentieth century, the Western powersagreed to abrogate the ‘unequal treaties’ and
Japan developed a military power not onlycapable of defeating its much larger neighbour,China, but also one of the Western great powers,
Russia. The foundations of a modern state had
been laid and Japan stood on the threshold of
replacing Western dominance in eastern Asia. Bythe fourth quarter of the twentieth century,though its military power was modest and its
Asian territorial empire broken by the West, Japan
had become an industrial power.Economic and social change from the earlynineteenth century onwards eroded Japan’sorderly traditional society. To internal strains wereadded external ones all pointing to the need for a
stronger state, an ending of the shogunate era 
and a centralised nation built around a restored
monarch. The urgent need for such strengtheningwas brought home to the Japanese by the forcibleappearance of the West. Japan’s response under
the last of the shoguns was to make an effort to
catch up with Western military technology. The
industrialisation of Japan had its beginning not in
the setting up of a textile mill, but in a shipyard in1863 capable of building steam warships. Theprocess was much accelerated after the 1868 
revolution known as the Meiji Restoration. The
requirements of armaments and attempts to gain
self-sufficiency created the Osaka Ironworks(1881) and at about the same time steel-makingby the Krupp method was started. Heavy industryChapter 7THE EMERGENCE OF JAPAN, 1900–29
was expanded originally to meet these nationaldefence needs before a single railway line was con-structed. National defence never lost this primacy
of concern in Japan, at least not until after the
Second World War. Its population lived in com-
pact territories which made arousing a sense ofnational consciousness and patriotism easier thanin the vast area of China. The revolution which
overthrew the shogunate and started the Meiji era
was a turning point in this respect too, as in other
aspects of the modernisation of Japan. The great
feudal domains were abolished and the peoplewere now subject to the imperial government,which strengthened its central authority in many
ways in the 1870s and 1880s.The rapid progress achieved by Japan had itsorigins, nevertheless, in the period before 1868.There already existed large groups of educatedpeople – the former warriors (the samurai), mer-
chants and craftsmen, who had obtained some
Western technological knowledge through con-
tacts at the port of Nagasaki, where the Dutchmerchants were allowed to remain under rigidsupervision – they formed a reservoir of people
with a capacity to learn and adapt to new Western
skills. The revolution of 1868 brought to power a
remarkable group of samurai statesmen. They
restored the monarch to his ancient pinnacle; theemperor was no mere ﬁgurehead. He was advisedby a small group, later a council of elders, or genro,who wielded enormous power. He listened to
their advice, but at times of differences between
the genrohis own views were decisive, and atcritical moments of Japanese history the emperoractively used his prerogative as ﬁnal arbiter. Below
the emperor and the genrocouncil, which had noformal place in the constitution, a Western struc-
ture of government with a prime minister, Cabinet
and an elected parliament was set up in the lastdecades of the nineteenth century. Despite theoutward style of Western government, Japan was
not democratic but was ruled by a few prominent
leaders. The Meiji Restoration was no social
revolution but a revolution from above.By the turn of the century, the young reform-ers of the 1860s had become elder statesmen. Pre-
eminent among this small group were Ito
Hirobumi and Yamagata Aritomu. Ito was Japan’selder statesman and the best-known Japanese inthe West. He had travelled and studied in theWest and was responsible for Japan’s representa-
tive constitution. Field Marshal Yamagata had cre-
ated the modern Japanese army, which proved
victorious in the wars with China in 1894–5 andwith Russia in 1904–5. He was opposed to Ito’spolicies at home, and Ito’s more paciﬁc approach
to foreign affairs. In 1909 Ito was assassinated in
Korea; soon Yamagata’s inﬂuence also weakened
when after 1914 the surviving genrogrew old andwere replaced by new power groups.In foreign relations 1895 is a year of great import-ance for Japan. During the period from the ﬁrst
diplomatic contacts down to 1894 the Japanese
had preserved their independence from the West.Indeed, a start was made in negotiating treatieswith the European powers that would lead in due
course to the abrogation of the wounding special
treaties. The treaties had placed the Europeans in
Japan beyond Japanese authority on the groundsthat the Japanese lacked the civilisation to beentrusted with applying their laws to Europeans.
But one reason why the West did not attempt to
carve out spheres of interests or colonies in Japan
as in China is to be found in the fact that the
Europeans were impressed by Japanese progressin adopting Western ways and by their conse-quent growing strength. But what was more
important during these critical early decades was
that the West did not regard the commercial pos-
sibilities and the market of Japan as nearly asimportant as China’s for the future. Japan’sneighbour, tsarist Russia, deliberately rejected a
policy of penetrating Japan in favour of the
exploitation of China. The same was true of the
other Western powers. At the turn of the century
the scramble for European concessions was reach-ing its height in China, and Britain’s place as theparamount power in eastern Asia was being chal-
lenged. The colonial secretary, Joseph Chamber-
lain, declared, ‘our interests in China are so great,
our proportion of the trade is so enormous andthe potentialities of that trade are so gigantic thatI feel no more vital question has ever been
presented for the decision ... of the nation’. The

West’s image of China protected Japan and1THE EMERGENCE OF JAPAN, 1900–2981
contributed to the very different development ofthe two nations after the incursion of the West ineastern Asia.In 1895 Japan had just brought to a victori-ous conclusion a war with China over the ques-
tion of the suzerainty of Korea. As part of itspeace terms it had forced China into territorialconcessions. This step by the Japanese into what
the European powers wished to keep as their pre-
serve led to an angry reaction by France, Germany
and Russia, which demanded that Japan give up
its territorial spoils in China. It was with anational sense of humiliation that the Japaneserulers bowed to this pressure.The Japanese, who had lived at peace withChina for close on a thousand years, had learned
from the West that a great power must acquire anempire and exercise power beyond the nationalfrontier. But Japan was not treated as an equal.
This realisation marks a turning point in the
Japanese outlook. It was necessary to study every
move carefully; Japan would succeed only by thejudicious use of force coupled with guile and thenonly if the Western powers were divided and so
could not combine against it.A complex two-tier decision-making processdeveloped from 1901, after which time no indi-
vidual genro led the government; policy was ﬁrstdiscussed between the different groups in the gov-ernment and then by the genro. This reinforcedthe tendency to discuss fully all aspects, advan-
tages and disadvantages, of every important policy
decision. The emperor was the supreme authority.The genro were expected in the end to submit tohim an agreed decision for his formal consent. But
in the Meiji era the emperor’s inﬂuence was con-
siderable and he could to some degree steer and
prolong genro discussions on important issues onwhich there were differences of opinion. In itsfullest and most constructive form this deliberateway of reaching group decisions after long and
careful discussion lasted until about the First
World War, when the advancing age of the surviv-
ing genro weakened their inﬂuence. The inﬂuenceof Emperor Meiji’s descendants did not match hisown. His son, whose reign lasted from 1912 to
1926, was weak in health and mind; his grandson,
Emperor Hirohito, was supreme only in theorybut followed until 1945 the advice of Japan’s mil-itary and political leaders. The post-Meiji emper-ors were kept aloof from any real role in the
making of decisions. In later decades the Japanese
looked back on the Meiji era as a period of brilliant
success abroad as well as at home, a golden age.Japan’s policy towards the eastern Asian main-land from 1900 until the outbreak of the Great
War in Europe illustrates both circumspection
and, ultimately, boldness. There was an attempt to
steer a middle course between the exponents of
expansion and the more cautious groups whowished to strengthen Japan in Korea by means ofcommerce and inﬂuence rather than outright ter-
ritorial control. With the acceptance of the alliance
Britain offered in January 1902 – after long debate
and scrutiny – the Japanese leaders knew that, if itcame to war with Russia, Japan could count onBritain’s military help if any other power joined
Russia against it. By diplomacy the Japanese had
ensured that they would not be blocked by a
united European front aligned against it as in1895. The genro decided for war in February1904. But in launching a war against Russia the
mood was not one of arrogance. The Japanese
leaders knew they were taking a carefully calcu-
lated risk. They hoped to do well enough to gain
Japan’s most important aims: expansion of terri-tory on the Asian mainland and security for Japanand its empire. Specifically the Japanese were
determined to achieve dominance over Korea and
southern Manchuria.The genro,at the time they decided on war,
were already considering how the war might beended in good time. There was no expectation that
Russia could be completely defeated. Russia was
not brought to the point where it could not have
continued the war, although its navy was annihi-

lated and Japan also won spectacular successes onland. Yet the Japanese, too, were exhausted by thewar and, through President Theodore Roosevelt’s
mediation, secured a peace treaty which brought
them great gains. These gains, however, fell short
of their expectations. There were riots in Japanwhen the peace terms became known in September1905. The Japanese people wanted Russia to
acknowledge defeat by paying reparation. The
Russians refused to do so and the genro knew that82BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTING BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER
Japan, its ﬁnancial resources weakened, was in noposition to continue the war in the hope of exact-
ing better terms. On 5 September 1905 the Peace
of Portsmouth was concluded.Japan did not use military force again, andthereby risk all it had gained in its wars withChina and with Russia, for a quarter of a century.By the time of the Meiji Emperor’s death in
1912, Japan had won international recognition as
a great power. Its alliance with Britain was
renewed, its ‘special’ position in northern China
acquiesced in, as well as its outright annexationof Korea. Internally too, Japan had made greatstrides during the forty-ﬁve years of the Meiji
Emperor’s reign.But on the negative side there were tensionsbuilding up in Japan. There was pressure frombelow among the more prosperous and inﬂuential
merchants, administrators, landowners and the
educated elites, all desiring some share in power;
they resented the fact that an entrenched oligarchy
ruled Japan from behind the scenes and monopo-
lised all the important positions in the state. Withinthe oligarchy, too, there was growing conﬂict

between the party-based governments demanding
independence of the genro, and the genro whoadvised the emperor on all questions of import-

ance. For a time the genro continued to exercisetheir traditional function. But the army, its prestigeraised by success in the Russo-Japanese War, won
a new place with the right to present its views 
to the emperor directly, so bypassing the civilian
governments. The remarkable unity that had been achieved during the founding years of theMeiji era under the leadership of the emperor 
and the genro no longer existed in the 1920s and1930s. Instead, powerful rival groups sought to
dominate policy. In the absence of the genro and astrong emperor, Japan lacked any supreme body to coordinate its domestic and foreign policies.The beginnings of strife between labour and
employers was also making itself felt as Japan
became more industrialised in the early twentieth
century. The educated Japanese became vulner-able to a cultural crisis of identity. Should Japaneseways be rejected totally? Western dress and con-
formity with Western customs became general
among the progressives. There also occurred anationalist-patriotic reaction. The Japanese eliteswere obliged to choose between Japanese tradi-tion and Western ways, or to ﬁnd some personal

compromise between the two.The First World War and its consequences broughtabout a decisive change in the international powerrelations of eastern Asia. The period was also 
one of economic industrial boom for Japan, 
whose earlier development provided the basis 
for rapid expansion. Japan benefited, second 
only to the US, from the favourable conditionscreated by the Allies’ needs at war and their disap-
pearance as strong competitors in Asian markets.
The First World War enabled Japan to emerge as
an industrial nation.Japan joined the Allied side in the war in 1914after careful deliberation. China, after the revolu-tion of 1911, was showing increasing signs of
losing its national cohesion. For Japan, the war in
Europe provided an opportunity to strengthen
and extend its position, especially in Manchuria.But behind Japanese expansion there was also a‘defensive’ motivation similar to the earlier impe-
rialism of the West and similar as well to fears
expressed by American strategic planners. What
would happen when the war was over? The genroYamagata was convinced that the Great Waramong the Western powers would be followed bya global racial struggle, a struggle between ‘the
yellow and white races’; Japan would therefore
have ‘to make plans to prevent the establishment
of a white alliance against the yellow races’. Helooked to friendly relations with Russia and theavoidance of hostility with the US. The relation-
ship with China was critical. Here, Yamagata
sought the best of all worlds: the practical estab-
lishment of Japan’s senior partnership in a friendly
alliance. Japan should seek to ‘instil in China asense of abiding trust in us’. China and Japan,‘culturally and racially alike’, might then preserve
their identity when competing with the ‘so-called
culturally advanced white races’. When the
Japanese made their Twenty-one Demands onChina in 1915, the Chinese naturally regardedthe Japanese from quite a different point of view
– more as enemies than friends. In their ﬁrst form
the demands amounted to a claim for a Japanese1THE EMERGENCE OF JAPAN, 1900–2983
protectorate, including insistence on employingJapanese ‘advisers’ in financial, military andadministrative affairs in the Chinese government.
Until the close of the First World War there was
little the Western powers could do to restrain
Japan, beyond diplomatic pressure.In the Taisho (meaning ‘great righteousness’)era from the Meiji Emperor’s death in 1912 until
the death of his son in 1926, it seemed that,
despite Japanese assertiveness in China during the
Great War, the overall trend would be towards
greater liberalisation and peace. The genro wereceasing to play so critical a role, especially afterYamagata’s death in 1922, and one great obstacle
towards constitutional parliamentary development
was thereby removed. The new emperor was weak
and the powers of the government increased. Yet,as developments after 1926 were to show veryclearly, in the end the ‘liberal’ Taisho period
marked only a transition to a more illiberal and
authoritarian state than had developedin the Meiji

era. There were signs too that Taisho was ‘liberal’only in a very restricted sense. Industrial expan-sion, ﬁrst fostered by the state, was later handed
over to a few large business enterprises still pre-
eminent today. These huge business empires, the
zaibatsu, were conducted paternalistically andrequired loyalty from their employees from thecradle to the grave. Links between big businessand the state remained unusually close. There was
no possibility of the growth of a strong and inde-
pendent democratic labour movement under such
industrial conditions.Distress arose in Japan at the end of the wardue to the phenomenal rise in the price of rice,
the country’s staple food; this led to serious riots
all over Japan in the summer of 1918. Troops
repressed the violence in the towns and villages
with great severity. Hundreds of people werekilled and thousands more arrested. The collapseof the war boom in 1921 led to further repres-
sion of any signs of socialism or of attempts by
labour to organise. The devastating Tokyo earth-
quake in September 1923 became the pretext forarresting Koreans, communists and socialists whowere accused of plotting to seize power. Many
were lynched by ‘patriotic gangs’. The police were
given authority to arrest and imprison anyone sus-pected of subversive thoughts, and many werebrutally treated. Compulsory military training ofJapanese youth was seen as a good way to
counteract ‘dangerous thoughts’. Thus the 1930s
cannot be seen as a complete reversal of the
Taisho period.In Japan’s relations with the world, too, thereis more continuity than at ﬁrst appears. On the
one hand the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the
emergence of the US as a world power had reper-
cussions of enormous importance in eastern Asia.
The Soviet leaders succeeded for a time in forgingan alliance with Chinese nationalists in a jointdrive against Western and Japanese imperialism.
On the other hand, the US was calling for a new
deal for China and an end to the pre-war power
alliances, particularly the Anglo-Japanese alliance,which had enormously strengthened Japan’s posi-tion in Asia. But the Japanese government, beset
by severe economic problems in the 1920s, 
and dependent on American trade, was in no
position to resist the US. This became clear at the Washington Conference in 1921–2. Severaltreaties were signed, placing the security of the
eastern Paciﬁc and the integrity of China on a
multinational basis. The Japanese were obliged to
return to China the Shantung province gained at
the Paris Peace Conference. A naval limitationstreaty placed Japan in a position inferior to Britainand the US, which were allowed a ratio of ﬁve
battleships each compared to Japan’s three.
Finally, Japan became a co-signatory to the nine-
power treaty to seek to uphold the unity ofChina. It is true that Japan also received privateassurances recognising its special interests in
Manchuria; nevertheless, the Washington Treaties
placed a considerable check on any Japanese
unilateral action in China.The ‘spirit of Washington’, as the great-powercooperation in eastern Asia came to be described,proved as unsuccessful in the long run as the
‘spirit of Locarno’ in Europe. Foreign Minister
Kijuro Shidehara became identiﬁed with Japan’s
paciﬁc policy in Asia and he loyally did his bestto act in its spirit. But there were ominous signsof the troubles to come. With the passing of genrocontrol the army became more independent and
chafed under the consequences of Japan’s new84BEYOND EUROPE: THE SHIFTING BALANCE OF GLOBAL POWER
foreign policy. Great-power cooperation provedsingularly ineffective in China and certainly didnot reduce either that country’s internal conﬂict
or its anti-imperialist feelings. Good relations with
the US were seriously harmed by the passage of
an immigration law in 1924 which excluded theJapanese, further strengthening the military viewthat the US had become Japan’s most likely
enemy. The rise of Chinese nationalism andChiang Kai-shek’s thrust to the north in 1926were seen as threats to Japan’s position inManchuria.The new emperor, Hirohito, whose reignbegan in December 1926, chose Showa, ‘enlight-
ened peace’, as the name of his era. But thedomestic and international difﬁculties besettingJapan were to make the coming years a period of
war and violence.1THE EMERGENCE OF JAPAN, 1900–2985
1Part III
THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION
AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
The shape of the future world after August 1914would now be decided by force. At the outset of
the war all the major nations launched offensives
to knock out the enemy quickly, and every oneof these offensives had failed by the autumn of1914 with great loss of life. War ended four years
later not by defeat of the armies in the ﬁeld alone,
as in the wars of the nineteenth century, but with
the breakdown of the political and economic
structure of the defeated, their societies weakenedor shattered.On the eastern war-front in August 1914 thetwo Russian armies assigned to invade East Prussia
were badly led. Fulﬁlling their undertaking to the
French, the Russian armies, superior in numbers,invaded East Prussia. After some initial Russiansuccess General von Hindenburg was called from
retirement to take command of the German
defence and he selected General Ludendorff as his
chief of staff. The myth of Hindenburg the heroic
war leader was born. At the battle of Tannenbergon 28 and 29 August one Russian army was prac-tically destroyed; the other was mauled in a subse-
quent engagement – the battle of the Masurian
Lakes – but was able to withdraw to Russia in
good order. Tannenberg is celebrated by theGermans in the tradition of the ancient Teutonicknights defeating hordes of Slavs. What followed
was as important as the battle itself and is less
heroically Wagnerian. The pursuing German army
of the second Russian army was, in its turn,thrown back by the Russians. The end result of theyear’s ﬁghting was heavy casualties on both sidesand neither a German nor a Russian decisive vic-
tory but a stalemate.Farther south, the Russians more than bal-
anced their defeat in Prussia by proving their mil-itary superiority over the Habsburg armies.
Austria-Hungary had launched an offensive into
Polish Russia and in September suffered a crush-
ing defeat; almost half (400,000) of the Austro-
Hungarian army was lost and the Russiansoccupied Galicia. Russia also suffered heavy casu-alties, a quarter of a million men. The ‘forgotten’
war in the east for three long years from 1915 to
1917 sapped Germany’s military strength by
forcing a division of Germany’s armies betweenthe two major fronts, east and west. Germanvictory in the east came too late to save it.Another military campaign which is forgotten,though it cost France 300,000 casualties, was the
1914 French offensive into Lorraine. The French
initiative came to be overshadowed by the Germanbreakthrough in north-west France. In accordancewith the (modiﬁed) Schlieffen Plan the German
armies attacked Belgium and were pouring into
France in a great enveloping move. At the frontier
the French armies were beaten and the smallBritish army, right in the path of the Germans,withdrew from Mons having suffered heavy casual-

ties. The French commander-in-chief, General
Joffre, did not lose his nerve despite these almost
overwhelming reverses. The French armies with-
drew in good order and escaped encirclement.1Chapter 8THE GREAT WAR I

stroke. The Germans had wheeled in before Paris.
Joffre and Gallieni halted the retreat and counter-
attacked. The outcome was the battle of theMarne, won by the French during the period 6to 13 September. Now it was the Germans’ turn
to withdraw; they halted 100 kilometres from
Paris having established a firm defence. The
battles spread and raged to the west, all the way
to Flanders, in a ‘race to the sea’ as the armiesattempted to outﬂank each other. The British,French and Germans suffered heavy casualties in
these epic struggles around Ypres. By the end of
November 1914, the machine gun, the trenches
and barbed wire ﬁnally proved the strength of thedefensive. The western front was now dead-
locked. The French had already suffered heavy
casualties in the ﬁghting in north-west France,
with 380,000 killed and 600,000 wounded. This
was matched by casualties on the German side.Yet it was only the beginning. The war in the westwould from now on be won not by superior strat-
egy, nor by movement and rapid encirclement,
but by the slow process of attrition. The Great
War had turned into the ﬁrst ‘industrial war’ to
be won as decisively on the home front produc-ing ever vaster quantities of guns and munitions,as in the ﬁeld.In Britain the Liberal government of Asquith atﬁrst preserved most civic freedoms. There was noconscription. Two million men volunteered inresponse to Kitchener’s appeal for a New Army.
But soon there were doubts whether the war could
be won by peacetime-style government. In the
spring of 1915 the government was being blamed
for a shortage of munitions. Asquith strengthenedthe government by bringing in the Conservatives;Labour, too, was found a place. A small War
Committee took over a tighter direction. Lloyd
George, the new minister of munitions, built up a
network of control over raw materials and manu-
facturing industry. War supplies improved andnational economic planning was seen to work,
which after the war boosted the claims of the
socialists. The war could not be fought in the tra-
ditions of previous victorious struggles. Thatbecame clear when conscription for military ser-vice was introduced early in 1916. Even so 1916
did not bring the expected victory. The politi-
cians sought a new leader to direct the war with
more ruthless purpose and energy. In December1916 the ﬁery and charismatic Welshman, LloydGeorge, replaced Asquith and headed a coalition
government for the remainder of the war.During the years of the war the individual lostmany rights as hope of a quick victory vanished. In
accepting state direction, organised labour coop-erated with the national government, and a polit-ical ‘truce’ was proclaimed in Britain as in other
belligerent countries. Due in no small measure to
Lloyd George’s skill, the dominant style was that
of cooperation rather than coercion, of preservingconstitutional parliamentary government ratherthan resorting to authoritarian rule.In France President Poincaré called for a ‘sacredunion’ in defence of the fatherland. Patriotism for
the anti-clerical republic was sanctiﬁed. Political
and social issues which had rent the republic beforewere now subordinated in face of the common
enemy invading France for a second time.
Symbolically the veteran socialist leader, Jean
Jaurès, who had so fervently denounced militarism
and had worked for Franco-German reconcilia-
tion, was assassinated by a nationalist fanatic on thevery eve of the war. He, too, would have joined
with his fellow socialists in the defence of France.For France, invaded and losing large tracts ofthe country right at the beginning of the war, itcould not be ‘business as usual’ – the inappropri-ate words of calm coined by Winston Churchill
across the Channel – because from the start
France was in imminent danger of defeat. That is
why the French were the ﬁrst to establish a gov-
ernment of national unity representing all partiesfrom left to right.Although the war was fought on French soil,and the loss of industrial north-western France was
serious, the French improvised war production and
relied on ﬁnancial and material aid from Britainand the US. Shortages of food and of necessitiessent prices soaring. Increasingly authoritarian
control of production, allocation of labour and
distribution had to be undertaken by the state.1THE GREAT WAR I91
The ﬁrst of the belligerents to organise theirproduction and manpower, however, were theGermans. The British naval blockade reducing
essential supplies from overseas – though war
materials continued to pass through neutral
Scandinavian and Dutch ports – made carefulplanning all the more essential. Substitute(Ersatz) materials were invented with scientiﬁcskill and ingenuity. As the general staff, with an
almost characteristic lack of prudence, had made
no plans for a long-drawn-out war, the war the
Germans had to ﬁght, it was a ‘civilian’, WalterRathenau, in August 1914, who was responsiblefor setting up a centralised organisation to ensure
the supply of essential raw materials.In Germany, too, the political parties closedranks to support the nation at war. Only a smallminority of socialists continued to oppose the war.The kaiser responded emotionally, declaring that:
‘I do not know parties any more, only Germans.’
He actually received the Social Democratic leaders
in his palace and they were happy to shake handswith their kaiser. Who would have believed a yearearlier such a thing would happen? Until 1916 the
Burgfrieden(literally ‘Courtpeace’, another typi-cally Wagnerian phrase) held, but then tensions
began to appear and a larger group of socialists
began to oppose the war. The Reichstag, unfet-tered, debated war aims and the conduct of gov-ernment, culminating in the famous peace
resolution of July 1917: ‘The Reichstag strives for
a peace of understanding and lasting reconcilia-
tion of nations. Such a peace is not in keeping with forcible annexations of territory ... .’ But 
it turned out that, if German armies were to 
prove victorious, the Reichstag did not expect 
its resolution to be taken too literally.In any case, the chancellor was dependent not on the Reichstag but increasingly on the high command. The kaiser, too, became more and more of a shadow. After Hindenburg and
Ludendorff had been appointed to the high com-
mand, they demanded in 1917 the dismissal of 
the Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg. He was tooindependent. His successors were nonentities andGermany practically fell under a Hindenburg–
Ludendorff military dictatorship during the last
year and a half of the war.If Austria-Hungary had been on the verge ofdissolution through the disaffection of theHabsburgs’ Slav subjects this would certainly have
shown itself when the Monarchy’s Slav neigh-
bours – the Russians and Serbs – went to war. In
Vienna and Budapest there was much concern.The Serb, Ruthene and Czech populations werelukewarm in their war effort. Some Czechs and
Poles formed their own Legions, which fought
for the Allies. But there were no large-scale
defections, let alone national uprisings. Croats,
Slovenes, Italians, Romanians fought bravely sideby side with Germans, Austrians and Magyars,and so did many Poles and Czechs.The Austro-Hungarian army was a uniquemultinational force. But in one respect it was not
unique: the incompetence of its leadership. Theordinary soldiers suffered appalling hardships, andcasualties during the ﬁrst nine months of the war
exceeded 2 million. Even so, new conscripts
allowed fresh armies to be formed. In 1915,
facing war on three fronts with Russia, Romaniaand Italy, the Monarchy was too weak to meet allits enemies, and substantial German armies were
needed to sustain the ally. The ‘national’ division
between Austria and Hungary also impeded the
war effort. The Hungarians refused to go short of
grain and proﬁted by raising prices to the Austrianhalf of the Monarchy, which went hungry. Warproduction, concentrated in Bohemia, was inefﬁ-
cient. But the multinational army fought on
doggedly, though new recruits failed to maintain
its strength, sapped by the losses in the ﬁeld. In1916 the aged Emperor Franz Josef died. Hissuccessor, Charles, believed the Monarchy was
close to collapse, having overtaxed its strength,
and he was soon secretly trying to make peace.
The army remained loyal to the dynasty virtually
to the end.New weapons killed in new ways: attacks fromZeppelins from the air and poison gas on land.
Far more serious in its effect of spreading war to
non-combatants was the conﬂict on the oceans.In 1915 Germany attempted to break the effectsof the British-imposed blockade by ordering its
submarines to sink all belligerent and neutral
ships which entered a ‘war zone’ around the92THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
British Isles. To avoid capture the submarines tor-pedoed, without warning, boats bound forBritain. On 7 May 1915 the Germans sank the
British passenger liner Lusitania; almost 2,000crew and passengers, including women and chil-
dren, lost their lives. World opinion, especially inthe US, was outraged: 128 Americans had beenamong those who had lost their lives. Germany’s
excuse that starving women and children in
Germany were victims of Britain’s food blockade
was always ﬂimsy. The submarine campaign failed
completely in its objective. It failed to cut off vitalsupplies from reaching France and Britain and itfailed to frighten the neutral countries from con-
tinuing to expand their trade with the Allies.Germany launched a propaganda campaign ofhatred directed especially against Britain. This hadlittle effect on those actually engaged on the bat-
tlefronts. Much to the embarrassment of the gen-

erals on both sides, the German and Allied troops
on the western front spontaneously stopped ﬁght-

ing on Christmas Day 1914, exchanged gifts andeven played football between the trenches. Therewas little hatred, even a good deal of fellow feeling.
The soldiers knew that there was no way out of the
war except through death or injury or victory.The Great War differed from the SecondWorld War in one very important respect. Therewere no planned atrocities committed by the mil-itary on prisoners of war or on civilians. Wartime
propaganda was, for the most part, lies. There
were no savage Huns killing Belgian priests, nuns
and babies, nor Belgian civilians behind the linesgouging out the eyes of wounded Germans. TheRed Cross was respected in all countries, includ-
ing tsarist Russia. Brutalities no doubt occurred
but they were isolated. The blot on this record
was the forced deportation of some 60,000
Belgians in 1916 to work in German factories.Though it was wartime, the socialists in theReichstag loudly protested; the deportations
ceased, and by the summer of 1917 the great
majority of the Belgians had been sent home
again. In Belgium itself no coercion was exercisedto force Belgian industry to work for the Germanwar effort, though factories were dismantled.
Only the miners, with the permission of the
Belgian government, continued to produce coal.Both among the Belgians and in occupiedRussian Poland, the Germans and Austriansattempted to win over the population to their
cause. The Poles were promised an independent
state at least in form, though in practice such an
independent Poland would have become aGerman satellite. There was no maltreatment.The Poles of Prussia and of the Habsburg
Monarchy fought with much loyalty for Germany
and the Habsburgs, seeing tsarist Russia as the
oppressor.Unquestionably the worst atrocity againstdefenceless civilians occurred in Turkey againstthe Christian Armenian people in 1915 and 
1916. When the war went badly for the Turks 
in 1915 and the Russians were pushing into
Anatolia, the Russians attempted to inﬂame andexploit Armenian nationalism against the Turks.An Armenian Legion fought for the Russians and
an Armenian puppet government was set up. The
Turks, uncertain of the loyalty of the Armenian
population in Asia Minor committed the worstatrocity of the war by ordering the wholesaledeportation of the Armenians from the lands
adjoining the battlefront to Syria. Armenian his-
torians accuse the Turks of genocide against their
people. Turkish historians admit that large mas-
sacres took place but deny that the Turkish gov-ernment intended them to happen. Sporadicmassacres had already taken place before 1914,
shocking Western Europe. What is certain is that
the tragedy of 1915 and 1916 was on an even
greater scale. The forced deportation of men,women and children caused the deaths of tens ofthousands through starvation and disease. Some
(by no means all) of the Turks reverted to out-
right massacres on the spot. There are no reliable
ﬁgures for those who perished. They vary, accord-
ing to whether the sources are Turkish orArmenian, from 200,000 to more than 2 million.Of the 1.6 million Armenians between a half and
three-quarters of a million perished.The ﬁve great nations of Europe went to war in 1914 not for any speciﬁc territorial gains. Itwas not a ‘limited’ war in the post-Napoleonic
nineteenth-century manner. The war was a gigan-
tic contest between them to determine their1THE GREAT WAR I93
power in Europe and the wider world. It belongswith the wars of international insanity of the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century. When that contest 
was decided, it was widely believed, it would
inevitably bring about also the ruin of the imper-
ial world ambitions of the defeated and providenew imperial prospects of conquest and inﬂuencefor the victors. The illusion was fostered that this
contest would settle the power struggle for ever.
Hence the phrase ‘the war to end wars’.For two small nations there was no choice.Serbia was guilty of provoking Austria-Hungaryand then in 1914, when faced with the Austrianultimatum, fought for its independence. The
Belgians were guilty of nothing. Their misfortune
was their strategic position between France and
Germany. Both French and German military plan-ners wanted to march through Belgian territory,but Britain had prevented France from taking the
initiative. Belgium wished to preserve its neutral-
ity. The king of the Belgians, even after the inva-
sion of his country, remained suspicious of bothsides. He claimed he was defending the little bitof Belgium still free from German occupation as
a neutral and not as an ally of Britain and France.In the Balkans another small nation, Greece,was finally brought into the war in 1917 by
France and Britain against the wishes of the king of Greece. Britain and France sent a militaryexpedition to Salonika in October 1915 and then
attempted to coerce the pro-German King
Constantine into war on the Allied side. Although
not as blatant as German aggression in Belgium,it was another violation of the rights of a smallnation.A number of European countries chose andwere able to remain neutral throughout the war:
the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Switzerland and Spain. Their sympathies betweenthe contestants were divided.Some industries in neutral countries experi-
enced a great boom. The Spanish coal mines in
Asturias and textile mills in Catalonia supplied the
French. Dutch industry developed; the Swissfound a ready market for clocks, machines andtextiles. The shortage of food made farming
highly proﬁtable. But in the last two years of the
war, while the farmers and some industrialistscontinued to do well, the standard of living of themass of the workers in the neutral countries ofEurope fell due to soaring food prices.The US was by far the most important and pow-erful of the neutrals from 1914 to 1917, the onlygreat power in the world not at war. The feelingof most Americans was that the war in Europe
was but one further chapter in the history of the
folly of European nations; it reinforced in their
view the wisdom of the Founding Fathers in
establishing the American republic and separat-ing its destiny from the rivalries of Europe. InEurope, the French, the English, Italians and
Russians were ﬁghting the Germans, Austrians

and Hungarians. During the Easter rising in
Dublin in 1916 some Irish were fighting theEnglish too; in the US their descendants lived atpeace with each other. Americans were convinced
that they were building a higher civilisation and
from this stemmed a genuine desire to help its
neighbours on the American continent and in the world to attain the blessings of liberty. This,too, was the faith of President Wilson. It helps 
to explain the missionary style of American 
diplomacy.Wilson’s moralising certainly led to somedecidedly contradictory behaviour. The US inter-vened on its own continent, sending troops to the countries of weaker neighbours in Mexico,
Haiti, Santo Domingo and Nicaragua to establish
American supremacy and naval bases in the
Caribbean. But this was not seen as anything atall like European ‘imperialism’. The purpose ofthe US was ‘pure’: to teach its badly governed
neighbours the beneﬁts of American democracy.
If people were enlightened and were given a free
choice then Americans believed they would
choose the American way.In August 1914 Wilson issued a neutralityproclamation. Both Allied and German propa-

ganda sought to persuade the American people
that right and justice were on their side. The
Germans emphasised that they were ﬁghting adespotic and cruel regime in Russia, whose per-secution of the Jews had already led to a great
exodus of immigrants to the US. The British
dwelt on the rights of small nations and the94THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
dangers to a peaceful Europe if the kaiser andPrussian militarism were to get away with break-ing treaties and attacking weaker neighbours. The
behaviour of the countries at war made a deep
impression on the US and nothing more so than
Germany’s warfare against defenceless merchantvessels and even passenger liners. The presidenttook his stand legalistically on ‘neutral rights’, the
right of Americans to travel the oceans safely and
of American merchant ships to trade with Europe.
Wilson protested at Britain’s conduct of the
blockade and Germany’s ruthless submarinewarfare designed to cut off the British Isles fromthe world’s arteries of trade essential to its war
effort. Wilson’s protests were effective. Rather
than risk an American declaration of war, the
German government desisted from attackingAmerican ships in 1915 and on 1 September alsopledged not to sink any more Allied passenger
liners, which had also led to the loss of American
lives. Meanwhile, the loss of American lives and
the ruthlessness of German warfare had swung themajority of American opinion in favour of theAllied cause. But this was sentiment, not action;
the Americans also stood behind their president
in wishing to keep out of the war.The American people, at the same time, sawno reason why they should not proﬁt from thehuge increase of trade brought about by the war.While Germany was just about able to maintain
its trade with the US through neutrals, US trade
with the Allies increased fourfold. By 1916 that
trade was calculated at a staggering $3,214million, whereas trade with Germany and theneutrals amounted to a little over $280 million.
The war resulted in a great expansion of American
industry. During the war years Ford developed a
mass market for motor cars and trucks. It was the
beginning of the motor revolution, whichmatched in importance the earlier railway revolu-tion in transport. Free from the burdens of war,
the US developed new technologies and more
efﬁcient methods of industrial manufacture, out-
distancing the European nations more and more.As the Allies used up their capital to purchasefrom the US, America itself replaced Britain as the
principal source of capital to other nations.
American prosperity came to depend on Alliedpurchases and, when these could no longer bemet by payment, the prohibition against loans tothe belligerents was relaxed. However, Britain’s
command of the sea prevented the Germans
importing goods directly through their ports
from overseas, though supplies did reach themthrough neutral ports. America’s response toAllied needs meant that its economic strength was
thrown predominantly behind the Allied cause
long before it formally abandoned neutrality.There was no reason for the US to go to war.It was still safe from European attack and wasconstructing a navy designed to be as powerful asany in the world to guarantee that safety in the
future. It coveted no more territory. But already
Americans perceived weaknesses in their position.
The growth of Japanese power in Asia, no longerchecked by the Europeans, threatened Americaninterests in Asia. Even more worrying appeared to
be the prospect of the European conﬂict ending
in the complete victory of one side or the other.
That would destroy the global balance of power.Would not the US then be faced with the threatof a European superpower? American naval war
plans before April 1917 were intended to meet
that danger and not the possibility of joining on
the Allied side. It made sense that Wilson would
attempt to preserve the European balance byattempting to persuade the belligerents to con-clude a compromise peace. But all his efforts in
1915 and 1916 failed. They failed for a simple
reason. As long as the Germans occupied Belgium
and northern France they felt themselves at leastpartially victorious, but the Allies would contem-plate no peace unless Germany gave up all its con-
quests. This would have made the sacriﬁces of
Germany all in vain. In truth, neither side was
ready to conclude a peace that might prove
merely temporary. The only way they could con-ceive of ensuring a durable peace was throughtotal defeat of the enemy.When the ﬁrst two months of the war did not leadto the expected decision, France, Britain andRussia and Germany and Austria-Hungary hopedto strengthen their position by winning new 
allies and opening up new war-fronts to threaten
their enemies. The Germans were the ﬁrst to be1THE GREAT WAR I95
successful in this respect, persuading the Turks toattack Russia and enter the war in October 1914.The Turkish decision not only widened the area of
conﬂict but also profoundly changed the history
of the Middle East. The future of the Middle East
became a bargaining counter between the powersat war. Britain invaded Mesopotamia to secure theoilﬁelds, and supported an Arab revolt. Less suc-
cessful was a British and French naval attack on
the Dardanelles repelled by the Turks in February
and March 1915. However, an attack on Turkey
was still seen by Churchill and Lloyd George asthe best way of striking a decisive blow in a wardeadlocked in the west but immensely costly in
human life. In April 1915 British and French
troops landed on the Gallipoli peninsula with the
object of capturing Constantinople. But the Turksdefended resolutely, and the Anglo-French cam-paign was a failure. Turkish and Allied losses were
heavy before the Allies ﬁnally decided on evacua-
tion, which they completed in January 1916. The
Ottoman Empire did not play a decisive role in thewar: the Turkish participation on the losing sideresulted in its dismemberment and the dramatic
growth of Arab nationalism.Ottoman territory was held out as bait duringthe war in order to keep one ally, Russia,
involved. In the famous ‘secret treaties’, Britainand France in 1915 promised Constantinople andthe Straits to Russia. Other portions of the empire
were promised to Italy as colonies by the Treaty
of London (April 1915) to induce the Italians to
join the Allies and attack Austria-Hungary to thenorth.Though nominally partners of the TripleAlliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, the
Italians had declared their neutrality in August
1914. For the next nine months they were wooed
by both sides. The Italian government in the endchose war for territorial gain alone, though thepoliticians were divided whether or not to go to
war. The government blatantly sought to extract
the best bid, an attitude dignified by Prime
Minister Salandra as conforming to sacro egoismo.What was decisive for Italy was a determinationto complete its ‘liberation’ and to wrest from
Austria-Hungary the Italian-speaking lands of the
Trentino and Trieste. But its appetite was largerthan this; the Italian government hoped also toacquire the German-speaking South Tyrol as wellas influence and territory in the Balkans and
Ottoman territory in Asia Minor. The Austrians
felt they were being blackmailed. ‘Against brig-
ands such as the Italians are now, no diplomaticswindle would be excessive’, secretly wrote theAustrian prime minister. The Allies offered the
most. In May 1915 the Italians declared war on
Austria-Hungary and so quite unnecessarily
entered a war that was to prove for the Italians
immensely costly in human life and materialresources.For the Balkan states the Great War providedan opportunity to start a third Balkan war for 
the satisfaction of Balkan territorial ambitions.
Bulgaria in September 1915 joined the war on theside of Germany and Austria-Hungary with thepromise of large territorial gains, including
Serbian Macedonia. A year later, in August 1916,
Romania was promised by the Allies Romanian-
speaking Transylvania and part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire as well as other territories, andit declared war to secure them.In eastern Asia, Japan’s chosen policy was tostrengthen its position in China. It declared war
on Germany in August 1914, captured Germany’s
Chinese colonial sphere and then presented to China the Twenty-one Demands to assure itself a predominant position. The war begun by
Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, France and
Britain for one set of reasons widened to include
other nations, all of whom, with the exception ofthe US, saw in it an opportunity for extendingtheir territorial empires.In each of the belligerent countries there weresome politicians who, after the failure to win the
war in 1914, looked towards the conclusion of a
compromise peace. But, despite President Wilson’sefforts to build a bridge between the combatantsthrough mediation, the generals and the govern-

ments conceived only of a peace ended on the vic-

tor’s terms. This attitude, as much as the outbreak
of the war itself, changed the course of world his-
tory. In Berlin, Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg attimes viewed the unfolding drama in terms of
Greek tragedy; it would be disastrous for civilisa-

tion whether Germany won or lost. In victory,96THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
would he be able to keep in check crude conceptsof military conquest?In the plans for a peace following a Germanvictory which Bethmann Hollweg drew up in
September 1914, he tried to create a new Europe,
at least a new continental Europe, because hecould not conceive of defeating Britain, only ofisolating it through the defeat of Russia and
France. He said he wished to conclude a so-called
‘Bismarckian’ peace of limited annexation. On the
other hand he was convinced that France and
Russia must be so weakened that they would neverbe able to threaten Germany again. Belgium, andeven a coastal strip of northern France, would
have to fall under direct or indirect German con-
trol. Through the creation of autonomous states,
carved out of the Russian Empire, but madedependent on Germany, Russia would be pushedfar to the east. A continental economic custom
union would bring prosperity to all, and reconcile
continental Europe to German hegemony while
excluding Britain. All this he called ‘MiddleEurope’. To satisfy imperial ambitions, theGerman African colonies would be augmented
with French and Belgian colonial possessions to
form German ‘Middle Africa’. The base of
Germany’s political and economic power would,
however, have lain in its domination of continen-tal Europe. There was to be no return to the bal-ance of power. This meant in practice the
destruction of Russia and France as great powers
and a compromise peace with Britain which would
acknowledge Germany’s continental domination– hardly a limited Bismarckian peace!Russian aims were both speciﬁcally territorialand absolute. The Russian government wished to
fulﬁl what it regarded as Russia’s ‘historic mission’
of acquiring Constantinople and control of the
Straits. What this involved was the ﬁnal destruc-tion of Ottoman power and its replacement by aRussian domination of the Balkans, Asia Minor
and as much of the Middle East as France and
Britain would allow.All Allied war aims were dependent on defeat-ing Germany. With Germany eliminated as a greatpower, the reduced Habsburg Empire and the
smaller Balkan states presented no problem to
Russia. The rivalry of allies would be more seriousthan the ambitions of former enemies. We cangain a glimpse of Russian aims. According to theFrench ambassador’s memoirs, the Russian
foreign minister, Sazonov, told him on 20 August
1914 that the ‘present war is not the kind of war
that ends with a political treaty after a battle ofSolferino or Sadowa’; Germany must be com-pletely defeated.My formula is a simple one, we must destroyGerman imperialism. We can only do that by
a series of military victories so that we have along and very stubborn war before us ... But
great political changes are essential if ... the

Hohenzollern are never again to be in a posi-
tion to aspire to universal dominion. In addi-
tion to the restitution of Alsace-Lorraine toFrance, Poland must be restored, Belgiumenlarged, Hanover reconstituted, Slesvig
returned to Denmark, Bohemia freed, and all
the German colonies given to France, England
and Belgium, etc. It is a gigantic programme.But I agree with you that we ought to do ourutmost to realise it if we want our work to be
lasting.It is a commonplace to compare the peace ofBrest-Litovsk of March 1918, which the Germansimposed on the hapless Russians, with Versailles,and to conclude that the Germans only justly
received what they had meted out to others. The
reverse is also true. The Russians had every inten-
tion of treating the Germans as harshly as theGermans treated Russia in defeat. When wecompare the ‘war aims’, it becomes rather haz-
ardous to pass comparative moral judgements on
them.The French government also wanted to imposeconditions on the defeated so that they wouldremain victors for all foreseeable time. The French,alone among the great powers, were ﬁghting the

same enemy for the second time for national sur-

vival. French territorial demands were limited to
Alsace-Lorraine and colonies. But French require-
ments went far beyond that, beyond the restora-
tion of Belgium, to the imposition of terms that as
Viviani, the French prime minister, declared to the
Chamber of Deputies in December 1914 would1THE GREAT WAR I97
destroy Prussian militarism. The economic imbal-
ance between Germany and France was to berighted by territorial cessions and by forcing the
Germans to transfer wealth – gold – to France
under the heading of ‘reparations’. Germany
would be made to ‘pay for the war’, to weaken itand to strengthen its neighbours.The British approach was more pragmatic,avoiding commitments as far as possible. There
was no desire whatever to reconstitute Hanover.
Indeed, there were no war aims formulated at all
during the ﬁrst two years of the war, except forthe restoration of Belgian independence, sincethis had been the principal ostensible reason for
going to war. Little thought was given to the
terms to be imposed on defeated Germany, far
more on what favourable inducements mightentice Germany’s allies to abandon it. There wasno desire to break up the Habsburg Empire. But
the one recurring theme, the destruction of the
war spirit of the principal enemy, was frequently
proclaimed. General Sir William Robertson, chiefof the imperial general staff, in a speech to muni-tion workers in April 1917, summed up this
uncompromising outlook: ‘Our aim is, as I
understand it, to deal German despotism such 
a blow as will for generations to come prevent a
recurrence of the horrors of the last two and a half years.’ But this did not mean exactly whatthe Russians and French had in mind.Britain’s

prime minister, Lloyd George, as well as Arthur
Balfour, the foreign secretary, were convinced
that Germany’s great power on the continentcould not be permanently diminished. The besthope for peace was the emergence of a peaceful
democratic post-war Germany. Thus, Germany
should not be driven to seek revenge to recover
territory won from it. Unjust and harsh treatment
of defeated Germany would only sow the seeds offuture conﬂict. Britain’s leaders looked to a closealliance with the US to guarantee the mainten-
ance of peace. Later differences which emerged
with France over the right policy to adopt are
clearly foreshadowed in British war aims. Thesewere only ‘absolute’ on one point: the security ofthe British Empire from any future German chal-
lenge. Germany would not be permitted again to
compete with Britain’s naval supremacy. As forother war aims, they were to be formulated byBritain during the war in response to the demandsof allies, or would-be allies, or in pursuit of mili-
tary objectives. The latter led to the encourage-
ment of the Arab revolts against the Turks, for
instance, and so to the post-war transformation ofthe Middle East.The attempts of the belligerent nations to win adecision in 1915 and 1916 all failed at a cost 
in human life never before experienced. Both
sides on the western front attempted to breakthrough the other’s carefully prepared defences.For the soldiers this meant leaving the security of
their own trench and advancing across a ‘no-
man’s land’ raked by machine-gun ﬁre to the

enemy trench protected by barbed wire and bay-onets. If you were lucky, artillery had clearedsomething of a path before you and disorganised
the defence, but it was rarely totally effective. If
good fortune favoured you, you actually reached
the enemy trench; others only moved a few yardsbeyond their own trench before falling to theenemy ﬁre. French and British offensives were
launched by Joffre and Haig in the spring of
1915. No breakthrough was achieved; the little
territory gained was no compensation for the
appalling losses. In the autumn of 1915 the Alliesrenewed their offensive, ending again without any worthwhile gain; 242,000 men were lost by
the Allies in that autumn offensive alone. New
recruits were nevertheless still increasing the size
of the armies.On the eastern front German troops in 1915were now essential to sustain the Austro-
Hungarian front as well as their own. In succes-
sive Austrian and German offensives from January
to September 1915 the Russians suffered heavy
defeats, were driven from all German territory aswell as Habsburg Galicia and gave up a large areaof the Russian Empire including Russian Poland.
The Russian retreat demoralised the army. The
Germans and Austrians captured more than a
million prisoners and the Russians had lostanother million men. But the Russian war effortwas not broken. By enormous effort on the home
industrial front and by the raising of new troops
the Russian front-line strength reached 2 million98THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
once again in 1916. Some 4 million men had bythen been lost. The tsarist government, despitethe vast reserve of population, was incapable of
doing more than making good the losses. The
Russian armies that would by sheer numbers
steamroller over Germany and Austria-Hungarynever materialised in the First World War as theywould in the Second. That nightmare vision for
the Germans, which had been so powerful an
inﬂuence on them in deciding for war in 1914,
was illusory.Before 1915 was ended the ﬁrst of the nationsto have gone to war in August 1914 was crushed.Serbia was overwhelmed by a joint Bulgarian,
German and Austrian attack.The new front created by Italy’s entry into thewar in May 1915 resembled the ﬁghting in Francerather than in Russia. Although the Italiansenjoyed superiority over the Austrians, they suf-
fered heavy casualties in a series of offensives
during the course of 1915 without coming near
to winning any decisive battles or achieving abreakthrough. Here, too, the short glorious warthat was expected proved an illusion and Italy was
locked in costly battles of attrition. It was easier
to enter the war than to leave it with proﬁt.The central powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria) planned to carryon the war in 1916 so that through attrition theenemy would be exhausted. The German com-
mander in the west, General Falkenhayn, calcu-
lated that if the Germans attacked the fortress of
Verdun, then the French would sacriﬁce their
manpower to hold on to it. This would breakFrance’s morale.Verdun became associated with the dogged-ness of its French hero defender Pétain, who, like
Hindenburg, was to play a critical political role,
for which he was unsuited, in post-war Europe.Falkenhayn failed to take Verdun or to limitGerman casualties by the use of artillery as he hadplanned. By the year’s end German casualties – athird of a million men – were almost as heavy asthe French losses of 362,000 men.During the summer months until the autumnof 1916 the British and French armies not com-
mitted to Verdun launched their great offensiveon the Somme intending to bring victory. Thecasualties suffered in hurling men against well-
prepared positions were horrifying. The German
army was not beaten but, refusing to yield terri-
tory in tactical withdrawals, also suffered enor-
mous casualties. The French, British and Germanssacriﬁced more than a million men. British casu-alties alone exceeded 400,000, French 190,000
men, and the Germans around 500,000. Still
there was no decision.The Somme offensive in the west was part ofa co-ordinated inter-Allied plan to attack thecentral powers. Only the Russians in 1916 gained
a great victory. General Brusilov’s summer offen-
sive was an overwhelming success, destroying the
independent Austro-Hungarian war effort. TheAustro-Hungarian army lost more than 600,000men in casualties or as prisoners, the Germans
150,000. But Russia, too, failed to defeat Ger-
many in the east. Russian casualties were heavy
and multiplied during the ﬁghting from August
to September. As it turned out, though no oneexpected it at the time, the Brusilov offensive wasto be the last major Russian military effort before
the outbreak of the revolution in Russia. The
central powers did score one easy military success
in the east in 1916 after the halting of the Russianoffensive: the defeat of Romania. Its supplies offoodstuffs and oil now became available to the
central powers.While the war was being fought, during thewinter of 1916 and the following spring of 1917,
new forces were at work which changed its coursefundamentally: the intervention of the US and theRussian Revolution.1THE GREAT WAR I99
The upheavals in Russia during 1917 changed thehistory of the world. Russia broke with the evolu-
tionary Western path of national development.
The birth of communist power was seen by Lenin,its founder, as the means by which not only thevast lands and peoples of Russia would be trans-
formed, but also the world. For seven decades
Lenin was revered by half the world as its spiritual
guide despite the bitter dissensions among com-
munist countries as to which was the rightful heir.His vision of communism as a world force wasrealised less than twenty-ﬁve years after his death.One of the fascinations of history is that itshows how a man, in many ways very ordinary,
with ordinary human weaknesses, making mis-takes and bewildering his contemporaries with theinconsistencies of his actions, can exert enormous
inﬂuence on his own times and on the world
decades later. Napoleon and Hitler caused devas-
tation. Napoleon left some good behind him;
Hitler, nothing but destruction. Lenin’s reputa-tion today has suffered with the demise of theSoviet Union. Once elevated by propaganda, he
is now stripped of myth, but the impact of his
ideas was enormous.The success of Lenin’s revolution, and thebirth and growth of Soviet power, exercised greatappeal as well as revulsion. Lenin’s achievement
was that he gave concrete expression to the the-
ories of Karl Marx. The Russian Revolution
appeared as the beginning of the fulﬁlment ofMarx’s ‘scientiﬁc’ prophecy that capitalist societywas heading for its inevitable collapse and that the‘proletariat’, the workers hitherto exploited,
would take over and expropriate the exploiters.
The poor shall inherit this world, not the next.That was obviously an intoxicating message. Ofcourse, Marx had written his great works in the
mid-nineteenth century. Some ‘adjustments’ of
his predictions were necessary to square them
with the realities of the early twentieth century.In Germany, where Marx’s teachings had thelargest political following, and where a powerfulSocial Democratic Party emerged, the lot of the
working man was improving, not getting worse
as Marx had predicted. The collapse of capitalism
did not after all seem imminent. Some Germansocialists asked whether the party should not con-centrate on securing practical benefits for the
workers and accept the political system mean-

while. This became the policy of the majority of
the party. The British Labour movement was
clearly taking this direction too. In France thedoctrine of industrial and class strife leading torevolution had limited appeal outside the towns.
Marx’s apocalyptic vision of capitalism in its last
throes bore little relevance to conditions in the
most industrialised countries. But Lenin was not disconcerted. He sharply condemned all the‘revisionists’ and compromises with the ‘exploit-
ing’ bourgeois society. He found the answer to
the paradox much later in the book of an English
radical on the nature of imperialism. J. A. Hobsonbelieved that the drive for empire by the Euro-Chapter 9WAR AND REVOLUTION IN THE EAST, 1917
pean states was caused by the need of advancedWestern countries to ﬁnd new proﬁtable marketsfor investment. Lenin elaborated and went
further. Imperialism, he wrote, was the last stage
of capitalism. It postponed the fulfilment of
Marx’s prophecy. Because the Asiatic and Africanlabourer was cruelly exploited, employers couldafford to pay their European workers more. But
the extension of the capitalist world could only
postpone, not avert, its collapse. The proletariat
must steel itself for the ultimate takeover and not
compromise. The class struggle, as Marx taught,was the driving force of historical evolution.Anything that lessened the class struggle was
treachery against the proletariat.Lenin’s views were so extreme, ran so muchcounter to the world in which he lived, that themajority of socialists ridiculed him when they werenot accusing him of seeking to divide the social-
ist movement. Those who were not socialists did
not take him seriously. His following, even among
Russian socialists right up to the revolution ofNovember 1917, was only a minority one.This fanatical believer in the victory of the pro-letariat and castigator of bourgeois capitalist
society and its intelligentsia of professors, lawyers
and administrators had, himself, been born into
the strata of society he virulently condemned.More important privileges had given him theeducation and freedom indispensable to his early
success. The founder of communism indubitably
sprang from the Russian tsarist middle class, to
the embarrassment of some of his Soviet biogra-phers. His real name was Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.He assumed the name of Lenin later to confuse
the tsarist police. He was born in 1870. His
mother was the daughter of a retired doctor who
had become a small landowner. His father exem-
pliﬁed success and social mobility in nineteenth-century Russia: he had made his way from humbleorigins to the post of provincial director of
schools, a position in the Russian civil service enti-
tling him to be addressed ‘Excellency’. Lenin was
not ‘of the people’.Lenin was only sixteen when his father sud-denly died. A year later an unnatural tragedy
blighted family life. The eldest son of this emi-
nently respectable family, Alexander, a student inSt Petersburg, had become involved in a terroristconspiracy to assassinate the tsar. Apprehended,he was tried and hanged. Lenin now began to
study and enquire into his brother’s beliefs and
actions, which were a naive and violent response
to autocracy in the tradition of Russian terrorism.But in Russia there was not yet guilt by associa-tion. The family was treated with consideration.
Lenin was accepted to study law in the University
at Kazan. However, he was soon involved in
student protests and was expelled. For three years
he read and studied and became engrossed in theradical writings of his time.It was during this period that he ﬁrst discov-ered in Karl Marx’s writings a revolutionary phi-
losophy and a goal which, according to Marx, was
a scientiﬁc certainty. He spent his life working outthe right policies and tactics for Marxists to followin order to realise the goals of the proletarian rev-
olution. Unlike many other socialists, his faith in
Marx’s prediction was absolute, akin to that fol-
lowing a religious revelation. This faith and cer-tainty gave him strength, but Lenin saw no pointin martyrdom. His brother’s gesture had been
heroic but useless. The leader must preserve
himself and avoid danger. It was an aspect of
Lenin’s ice-cold rationality despite his attacks on
the intelligentsia – that he ignored taunts that hesent others into danger while he himself enjoyeddomesticity and safety abroad in London, Geneva
and Zurich.A remarkable feature of tsarist Russia at thistime is that despite police surveillance of politicalsuspects – and Lenin was undoubtedly a suspect– no political opponent was condemned for his
thoughts, as later in communist countries, but
only for his deeds. Even then punishment by later
standards was frequently lenient. The death
penalty was limited to those involved in assassi-nation, political murders or plotting suchmurders. If sentenced to dreaded fortress impris-
onment a man’s health could be broken. The
lesser sentence of exile to Siberia bears no rela-
tionship to the labour camps of Stalin’s Russia.The inhospitable climate was a hardship but therewas no maltreatment. Lenin, for instance, when
later on he was sentenced, was free to live in a
comfortable household and to study and read.1WAR AND REVOLUTION IN THE EAST, 1917101
But before this he was allowed a second chanceand after three years of waiting and petitioningwas readmitted to Kazan University. He was thus
able to complete his university studies before
moving as a fully ﬂedged lawyer to the capital, St
Petersburg. Here he plunged into political activ-ities and became a leading member of a smallgroup of socialists. Adopting the agitational tech-
niques of the Lithuanian Jewish socialist organi-
sation, the Bund, the St Petersburg socialists
determined to spread the message of Marxism by
involving themselves in trade union agitation onbehalf of workers. Lenin and his associates agi-tated successfully among the textile workers. The
police stepped in. Eventually, Lenin was sen-
tenced to three years’ exile in Siberia. In 1900 he
was permitted to return to European Russia. Hehad matured as a revolutionary. He believed hecould best promote the revolution by leaving
Russia, as so many socialist émigrés had done
before him, and to organise from safety in the
West. Perhaps the police authorities were happyto get rid of him. In any event, Lenin in 1900received the required permission to leave his
country. Except for a few months in Russia after
the outbreak of the revolution in 1905, Lenin
spent the years before his return to Russia in April
1917 mainly as an exile in Switzerland.Abroad, he developed the organisation of hisrevolutionary party based on his own uncompro-

mising ideology. In the process he quarrelled with
the majority of Russian and international socialists
and ﬁnally split the Russian Democratic SocialistParty. His faction, which at the Second PartyCongress in Brussels and London in 1903 man-

aged to gain a majority, became known as the
‘majority’ or Bolsheviks, and the minority took the
name of Mensheviks, although soon the fortunes
were reversed and until 1917 the Mensheviks con-
stituted the majority of the party. It is easier todeﬁne the Bolsheviks’ ideas than the Mensheviks’.
The Bolsheviks thought that leadership was estab-

lished by the power of Lenin’s personality and the
hardness and sharpness of his mind. Lenin imbuedthe Bolsheviks with his own uncompromising rev-
olutionary outlook. There was to be no coopera-

tion with the ‘bourgeois’ parties, unless for tactical
reasons it were expedient to support them brieﬂy
and then only as ‘the noose supports a hangedman’. Lenin believed a broadly based mass partyrun by the workers would go the way of the
Labour Party in Britain and weakly compromise.
Only a small elite could understand and master-

mind the seizure of power by the proletariat. Theparty must be centralised and uniﬁed. Lenin there-
fore sought to build up this party of dedicated rev-

olutionaries who would agitate among the masses
and take advantage of all opportunities, having but
one goal, the socialist revolution.The Mensheviks were never as united as theBolsheviks nor were they led by one man ofcommanding personality. In turn, they accused
Lenin of dictatorial behaviour. The Mensheviks
developed their own Marxist interpretations.
Accepting Marx’s stages of development, theybelieved that Russia must pass through a bour-geois capitalist stage before the time would be
ripe for the socialist revolution. And so when
Russia embarked on the constitutional experi-

ment after 1905, they were prepared to supportthe constitutional Kadet party in the Duma.Despite their Marxist authoritarian revolutionary
ideology, the leadership in practice softened the
line of policy. Lenin was never very consistent
about his tactics, but his driving passion for the
socialist revolution, his ruthless pursuit of this one goal when others in the party wavered andwere distracted, gave him ultimate victory over
the Mensheviks, who endlessly debated and advo-
cated freedom of speech. What true revolutionary
cared for ‘majorities’ and ‘minorities’? Lenin contemptuously regarded rule by the majority asa liberal bourgeois concept.Within Russia itself the adherents of the sup-porters of the Social Democratic Party had little
appreciation of why the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks
were quarrelling in face of the common enemy ofautocracy. It was not among the rank and ﬁle, small
in Russia in any case, that their differences mat-

tered. The Bolsheviks had no more than 20,000
members as late as February 1917. In any case it
was neither Mensheviks nor Bolsheviks who wonthe greatest popular support but the SocialistRevolutionaries. Formed in 1901, they looked to
the peasants rather than to the urban workers.
Some carried on the tradition of terror; a special102THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
group organised assassinations and thereby satis-fied the demand for immediate revolutionaryaction. In the long run the revolution of the peas-

antry would occur. Other Socialist Revolutionaries,
acting as a reforming party, would press for liberal
constitutional reforms and laws to protect the peas-ants. These liberal reforms would pave the way tosocialism later. The Socialist Revolutionary terror-

ist and party wings were never really coordinated.The revolution of 1905 took the Bolsheviksand Mensheviks by surprise. At the outset they
had only a small following among the workers,the Bolsheviks probably only a few hundred.Lenin did not affect its course. Nine years later,
the outbreak of the First World War appeared to
mark the end of international socialism as one
after the other the national socialist parties placedtheir countries before the brotherhood of theproletariat. Some socialists formed a paciﬁst wing;
with them Lenin had nothing in common. Only
a small band of revolutionaries gathered around
Lenin. He was brieﬂy imprisoned as a Russian spyin Austrian Poland at the outbreak of the war butwas released to rejoin the other socialist exiles in
Switzerland. The Social Democrat Party in Russia
had dwindled from its peak of some 150,000
members in 1907 to probably less than 50,000 in
1914 and only a small minority of them wereBolsheviks. But Lenin’s supreme self-assuranceand conﬁdence in Marx’s analysis enabled him to
survive disappointments and setbacks. For him
the conﬂict among the imperialists was the oppor-
tunity the socialists had been waiting for. Hehoped for the defeat of Russia and the exhaustionof the imperialists. Then he would turn the war
between nations into a civil war that would end
with the mass of peoples united in their aim of
overthrowing their rulers and establishing the
‘dictatorship of the proletariat’.Lenin’s view of the war and of the role of the socialists did not persuade even the left wing
of the socialists who met in conferences in
Switzerland at Zimmerwald in 1915 and Kienthal
in the following year. The majority wished tobring the war to a compromise end, with inter-national friendship and no annexations, and so
espoused a paciﬁst stand. Lenin attracted only a
handful to his side, among them the brilliant andfiery young Trotsky, who had inspired theworkers’ councils – the soviets – which hadsprung up during the 1905 revolution. Trotsky
believed in a ‘permanent revolution’. He forecast
that the bourgeois ﬁrst stage would ﬂow into 
the socialist second stage. Lenin closely sharedTrotsky’s views, believing he would witness thesocialist revolution in his lifetime. When the rev-
olution did occur, however, in February 1917,
the events took him once more by surprise.The overthrow of tsarism took place with startlingspeed. For the army of 6.5 million men in theﬁeld, 1916 had closed with hope for the future.
The Russian army, after suffering some 7 million
casualties, had nevertheless proved more than a
match for the Austrian army. Indeed, only thegreat power of the German army had stood in theway of total Habsburg disaster. The Germans
proved formidable foes, but they were now out-
numbered and the plans for a coordinated offen-
sive east, west and south on the Italian front heldout the promise that the central powers could beoverwhelmed in 1917. The severe problems of
weapons and munitions for the Russian army had
been largely overcome by a prodigious Russian
industrial effort during 1916. After the heavy
losses sustained in the third year of war, the rankand ﬁle in the army viewed war with stoicism andresignation rather than with the élan of the early
months. But it was not an army demoralised and
ready to abandon the front. The ‘home front’ was
the ﬁrst to collapse.The hardship suffered by the workers and their families in the cities swollen in numbers 
by the industrial demands of the war effort was,
in the winter of 1916–17, becoming insupport-
able. The ineffectual government was being
blamed. The tsar had assumed personal responsi-bility for leading the armies and spent most of histime after the summer of 1915 at army head-
quarters. He had left behind Empress Alexandra,
a narrow-minded, autocratic woman. The ‘minis-
ters’ entrusted with government were little morethan phantoms. The infamous Rasputin, on theother hand, was full of energy until murdered in
December 1916 – an event greeted with much
public rejoicing.1WAR AND REVOLUTION IN THE EAST, 1917103
The rioting that spontaneously broke out inPetrograd – formerly St Petersburg – early inMarch (23 February by Russian dating) 1917 was
not due to the leadership of the socialist exiles.
Their organisation within the country had suf-
fered severely when early in the war the tsaristgovernment smashed the strike movement. Yet,unrest in Petrograd and Moscow had been
growing. Only a proportion of the workers in war
industries had received wage rises to compensate
them for the rapid rises in the price of food and
other necessities. Other workers and the depend-ent families of the soldiers at the front wereplaced in an increasingly desperate position. The
peasants were withholding food from the towns
and were unwilling to accept paper money, which
bought less and less. The railway system wasbecoming more inefﬁcient as the war continued,unable to move grain to the towns in anything
like sufﬁcient quantities. Dissatisfaction turned onthe supposedly ‘German’ empress and the admin-istration and government which permitted suchgross mismanagement. The revolution in March
1917 succeeded because the garrison troops of
the swollen army were not loyal and would not
blindly follow the command of the tsar as theyhad done in peacetime.Quite fortuitously the Duma had begun oneof its sessions at the very time when this new
unrest began. Among the professional classes, the
gentry and the army generals, the Duma leaders
had gained respect, even conﬁdence, as faith inthe tsar’s autocracy and management of the warrapidly diminished. The feeling of country and
towns was still patriotic. Everyone was suffering –
gentry, workers, peasants and the professional
classes. The war against the invader should bewon. But at the same time an alleviation of thehardships that the population was suffering, espe-
cially food shortages, must be dealt withnow,
104THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
Lenin addressing a small street gathering; a wooden cart, no setting such as later leaders could organise, 1917.© Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbiswithout delay. There seemed no contradiction.The Duma was the one institution that providedcontinuity and embodied constitutional author-
ity. Under the pressure of striking workers and
increasing anarchy in Petrograd, the Duma at-
tempted to gain control over the situation. Itsleaders advised the tsar to abdicate. The tsar, lacking all support, hesitated only a short while
before giving up his throne. His brother declined
the poisoned chalice when offered the crown.
Once the decisive break of the tsar’s abdication
had been achieved there could be no saving of thedynasty. The Duma also gave up meeting, hand-ing over authority to a small group of men who
became the provisional government, composed of
mainly moderate liberals and presided over by a
benign ﬁgure of the old school, Prince Lvov. Thenew government contained one Socialist Revolu-tionary, Alexander Kerensky, whose cooperation,
however, was sincere and who set himself the goal
of revitalising the war effort by winning over the
Russian people with a programme of broad reformand freedom.From the start, the provisional government didnot enjoy undisputed authority. In Petrograd, as
in 1905, the Council of Soviets, of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies sprang up, claiming to speak on
behalf of the workers and soldiers throughoutRussia. They were not ready to rule but theyasserted the right to watch over the provisional
government and to act as they pleased in the inter-
ests of ‘political freedom and popular govern-

ment’. The provisional government sought thecooperation of the Petrograd Soviet and had toagree to permit the garrison troops, who had
taken the side of the revolution, to remain in
Petrograd. Henceforth, this disaffected force was
under the control of the Petrograd Soviet, and
could not be moved. The provisional governmentalso agreed to the establishment of soldiers’ coun-cils throughout the army, and the Soviet pub-
lished their famous ‘Order number one’ decreeing
that they should be set up in every army unit 
by election. But the Soviet, dominated byMensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, wasquite incapable of providing for the coherent gov-
ernment of Russia and had no intention either of
replacing the provisional government or of seek-ing an early end to the war other than through aRussian victory. Two leading Bolsheviks at thistime, Lev Kamenev and Joseph Stalin, were ready
to cooperate with the ‘bourgeois’ revolution.The Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputiesand the Soviets of Peasant Deputies were domin-ated by the Socialist Revolutionaries and had nothought of ruling the country. However, the pro-
visional government also found it increasingly dif-
ﬁcult to prevent the country sinking into anarchy.
Only the army at the war-fronts stood ﬁrm. At
home the provisional government spoke of agrar-ian reform, order, freedom and victory. A new,freely elected parliament would be called to
decide on Russia’s future and provide a govern-
ment based on the democratic wishes of the
people. But meanwhile the provisional govern-ment lacked the power and the means to improvethe conditions of the people. In the worsening
situation in May 1917, the provisional govern-
ment insisted that rivalry with the Soviets must
cease and that socialist representatives of theSoviets enter the ‘bourgeois’ government. TheSoviets agreed to share power in a coalition and
the fusion seemed to be consummated when
Alexander Kerensky, as war minister, became its
leading member.These developments were anathema to Lenin.With the assistance of the German high com-mand, who naturally wished to further the disin-
tegration of Russia, Lenin reached Petrograd in
April, having travelled from Switzerland by way
of Germany. Lenin had no scruples about accept-ing the aid of the German class enemy. Soon, hebelieved, revolution would engulf Germany too.
What mattered now was to win back the Russian
socialists to the correct revolutionary path, even
though he led the minority Bolsheviks. The
socialist revolution, Lenin believed, could bethwarted by the collaboration of socialists and thebourgeois government. With relentless energy,
overcoming what proved to be temporary failures,
he changed the revolutionary tide.For Lenin the mass upheaval taking place inRussia was more than a ‘bourgeois’ revolution.He believed the revolutionary upsurge would pass
beyond the bourgeois to the socialist stage
without pause. In his ‘April theses’ Lenin argued1WAR AND REVOLUTION IN THE EAST, 1917105
that the provisional government was the greatantagonist already of the ‘republic’ of sovietworkers and poor peasants taking shape among
the grass roots of society. This view was rejected
by the Socialist Revolutionaries, by the Men-

sheviks and at ﬁrst by many of the Bolsheviks aswell. But Lenin won the Bolsheviks over andthereby became the principal architect of the
course that the revolution took in November.
Lenin’s ﬁrst aim was to destroy the provisional
government. With agitation of ‘all land to the
peasants’ and ‘all power to the soviets’, he helpedthe revolutionary process along. But Lenin wasnot the actual cause of the increasing lawlessness;
he could only fan the already existing ﬂames. The
economic situation was daily getting more out 
of hand. Inﬂation was increasing by leaps andbounds. The provisional government was entirelyineffectual in halting the slide into chaos at home.
The one hope left for it was the army.Kerensky appointed a new commander-in-chief, General Kornilov, and ordered a freshoffensive in Galicia. The army responded, madesome progress at ﬁrst, but was then routed when,
in turn, facing an attack. Meanwhile, in July,
while the offensive was still in progress, fresh dis-
orders in Petrograd, supported by thousands of
sailors from Kronstadt, looked like the beginningof the new revolution. Lenin, however, regardedan uprising at this time as premature. The
Bolshevik leadership was divided in its response
and hesitated to give a lead to the masses. The
rising proved a total failure. The provisional gov-ernment branded Lenin a German spy andordered his arrest. He was forced into hiding and
later ﬂed to Finland. The prospect of an early
Bolshevik revolution now seemed remote. Yet,
despite the ruin of his hopes, Lenin’s diagnosis
that Russia was in the grip of a continuing revo-lutionary ferment proved, in the end, to becorrect.The turn of events in September aided theBolsheviks. General Kornilov was marching on
Petrograd with troops with the avowed intentionof destroying the Bolsheviks and dissension anddefeatism in the armies’ rear. Kerensky ordered
Kornilov to lay down his command. Kornilov
refused and proclaimed himself the saviour of thenation. Kerensky now appealed for armed helpfrom all the people, including the Bolsheviks.Kornilov’s march on Petrograd ended in ﬁasco,
but the Bolshevik militia, the Red Guards,
retained their arms. Lenin now set about the
overthrow of the provisional government. In thePetrograd Soviet the Bolsheviks in September1917 at last enjoyed a majority. Lenin returned
to Petrograd in October in disguise. He won over
the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party to
his view that the time was now ripe for an armed
insurrection. The task of organising the rising wasassigned by the Petrograd Soviet to a military rev-olutionary committee. Trotsky was its leading
spirit. To this threat, Kerensky and the provisional
government reacted complacently and too late.On the Bolshevik side there was not much con-ﬁdence either. Trotsky’s armed men were largelyuntrained. Nevertheless, Trotsky organised them
to seize power on 25 October (Russian date), 
7 November (Western date). Bolshevik strength,
feeble as it was, proved enough. Kerensky couldnot ﬁnd sufﬁcient troops to defend his government.With the seizure of the Winter Palace, wherethe provisional government was in session, the
virtually bloodless revolution was over. The insur-
rection had been deliberately timed so that it
coincided with the assembly of the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers’ andSoldiers’ Deputies. The Bolsheviks, who were in
the majority, dominated the proceedings. Until
the time when a constituent assembly was elected
and met, the Congress entrusted the executive toa provisional workers’ and peasants’ government,thus regularising the power won by Lenin and 
his associates. But the hold of power by the
Bolsheviks was precarious. It might last a day, a
week or longer. They could be overwhelmed by
a few hundred troops or outside powers. Lenin’sachievement was to solidify Bolshevik power untilit embraced the greater part of the former Russian
Empire.Had this birth of communist power fulﬁlledthe ‘scientiﬁc’ forecasts of Karl Marx, as Leninbelieved? Was it a realisation of the inevitable his-torical process of class conflict according to
Marxian theory? Lenin had to adapt Marx to ﬁt
the fact that the revolution had ﬁrst succeeded in106THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY

But hebelieved, thus squaring these facts with Marx’sanalysis, that the revolution in backward Russia
would not survive without the international
socialist revolution, without the proletarian revo-
lution, especially in neighbouring Germany.Russia had but provided the spark. The advancedindustrialised West, with its large proletariat
would, so he thought, take over the leadership of
the world revolution. In fact, the Russian crisis
had its immediate cause in the war – not in a
general world crisis of capitalism, but in thespeciﬁc failing of Russian autocracy and of theprovisional government to provide for the suc-
cessful economic and military management of 
the war. Tsarism ﬁrst and Kerensky next were
destroyed by inﬂation, by lack of food in the
towns and by the general hardships inﬂicted on apeople without an end to war in sight or sustained
victories to show for their immense sacriﬁces.The second All-Russian Congress of Sovietshad called for a just and democratic peace withoutannexations and indemnities, and had also abol-ished the landlords’ ownership of land. Bolshevik
propaganda in the army and the lawless state 
of the countryside, where the peasants seized 
the land, added to Russia’s state of anarchy. The
invading German armies, with their appeal to thesubject nationalities, Ukrainians, Georgians, Polesand the Baltic peoples, threatened Russia with ter-
ritorial disintegration. Lenin’s insistence on peace
with the Germans at any price appeared suicidal
even to his closest collaborators. Fighting ceasedand armistice negotiations were formally com-pleted early in December 1917. Meanwhile,
Lenin in November had permitted elections for
the Constituent Assembly to be held. When it
met in January 1918 the Bolsheviks found they
had not obtained a majority. Out of a possible520 deputies the Bolsheviks had only gained 161, and the Socialist Revolutionaries, with 267deputies, held an absolute majority. Lenin now turned his back on this ‘sovereign’ assemblyand the whole democratic process. The assembly
was adjourned and prevented from gathering
again.Trotsky was sent to negotiate peace terms withthe Germans. At Brest-Litovsk he prevaricatedand made ﬁne speeches. Lenin and the Bolshevik
leaders pinned their hopes on the coming
German revolution, spurred on by revolutionary
propaganda among the German troops. The
Germans lost patience with Trotsky’s intoxicationwith his own intellectual brilliance and occupiedlarge regions of western Russia virtually without
resistance. Trotsky thereby almost destroyed the
revolution in its infancy. On 3 March 1918, the
Russians, on Lenin’s insistence, and overrulingTrotsky’s tactics, accepted the peace terms ofBrest-Litovsk which dispossessed Russia of a large
part of its former empire. Lenin had cajoled and
bullied his colleagues on the Central Committee
into accepting the harsh terms. Then he had tofight again to achieve its ratification by theCongress of the Bolshevik Party.Peace with Germany gave Lenin and the Bol-sheviks a breathing space, and saved the Bolshevik
revolution. Lenin still conﬁdently expected the
war among the Western nations to turn into thegreat civil war and victory for the proletariat. Butmeanwhile the revolutionary spark had to be kept
alive. It was now threatened by anarchy and by
civil war from the opponents of the Bolsheviks,
aided by Russia’s former allies, who hoped some-how to bring it back into the war. In the succeed-ing years of war and famine, the Russian people
were to suffer even more than they had suffered
during the course of the First World War itself.
But at the end of this period, the ﬁrst communist
nation was firmly established in a world very different from the one imagined by Lenin at thetime of revolution.108THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
If the war had come to an end in 1917, if the con-ﬂict had been decisively won by either the Allies or
the central powers eighteen months earlier, then
for certain the history of the world would havebeen very different. Instead the war went on.Neither a compromise peace nor a decision on the
western front could be attained. European society
had withstood the strains of war for more than
two and a half years much better than anyone
thought likely in the beginning. In the third year,the toll of destruction ﬁnally began to crack thepolitical and social cohesion of Russia, the largest
of the European powers; nor could even the mili-
tarily stronger Western countries escape the con-
sequences of the conﬂict. The year 1917 marked agreat change in the direction of world history.From the start the war had not been entirelyEuropean. With the entry of Turkey into the war
in 1914 the destiny of the Middle East was bound
up in the war’s outcome. In what, from the point
of view of the war itself, was a sideshow, theBritish launched offensives in 1916, 1917 and1918 against the Turks and at the end of the war
became the predominant military power in this
region of the world. They were now bound to
agreements and promises to the French (theSykes–Picot agreement) to divide inﬂuence withthem after the war; to the Arabs they had held
out prospects of independence; and to the
Zionists, who under Chaim Weizmann’s leader-
ship were working for a Jewish state, ‘a NationalHome of the Jewish People’ in Palestine. Fromthese origins in the First World War developedthe Middle East conﬂicts that have continued

down to the present day.From the start, too, eastern Asia was involvedin the war. On the pretext of pursuing the waragainst Germany, Japan began by occupying the
German colonial sphere in China in 1914, and
went on to attempt to gain predominance over a
much greater part of China while the European
powers were locked in devastating conﬂict thou-sands of miles away. On the continent of Africathe war seemed only to result in a rearrangement
of colonies: a further chapter in the history of
imperialism. Yet the new ‘mandates’ of the League
of Nations over former German colonies held outeventual promise of independence for the Africanpeople. Peace treaties did not end these worldwide
repercussions of the war. National aspirations
which were intensiﬁed during the war continued
to ferment when the war was over.Nineteen-seventeen was a momentous year inworld history. Two events almost coincided: the
Russian Revolution and the entry of the US into
the war. By becoming a belligerent and assuming
world commitments, the US was in decisivebreach of the advice of the Founding Fathers ofthe republic. After the war, the American people
tried to treat this as an aberration and return to
normalcy and ‘isolation’. But Americans could
not escape involvement in global affairs in thetwentieth century as they perceived their security1Chapter 10THE GREAT WAR II
THE END OF WAR IN THE WEST, 1917–18
and prosperity threatened by events elsewhere inthe world.Because of the realities of American politics,the decision for war rested on the shoulders of
one man, President Wilson. Wilson’s secretary of
state, Robert Lansing, was a convinced interven-tionist on the Allied side long before Wilsonreached the same conclusion. He saw the war in
Europe as a fight for democracy against the
warlike Prussian Junker spirit; Lansing’s views did
not much affect the president one way or the
other. He listened more to his friend and personalemissary, Colonel Edward M. House. But Wilsonwas very much his own man, supremely conﬁdent
of his good judgement at a time when in ques-
tions of foreign policy, of peace and of war, the
presidency was virtually supreme. There can be nodoubt that his personal sympathies lay with thedemocracies. The overthrow of the tsar in March
1917 therefore removed one obstacle to the 
US siding with the Allies. Nor can there be any
doubt that from the start of the war in Europethe actual interpretation of American neutralityenormously favoured the Allied cause in provid-
ing ﬁnancial credit and war supplies, even though
Germany managed to secure some American
imports through the neutral Scandinavian ports
and Holland. Still, US policy was not even-handed and did not exemplify Wilson’s own callto the American people to ‘act and speak in 
the true spirit of neutrality’. In November 1916,
Wilson narrowly won a second term as president,
using such slogans as ‘He kept us out of war’.Was Wilson cynically playing politics when duringthe campaign he declared, ‘I am not expecting
this country to get into war’, although five
months later he led the US into just that?Wilson’s change of stance in April 1917, hispublic enthusiasm for the rightness and justice ofthe noble cause of war, was not what he felt; hehated war, and his efforts to keep the US out of
the war before February 1917 were genuine. To
claim that the US did not behave as a proper
neutral from 1914 to 1917, that Wilson hoped to frustrate a German victory by assisting theAllies, that he legalistically stretched the concept
of America’s neutral rights, condoning British
infractions and harshly condemning German vio-lations of these rights, does not prove that Wilsondesired or expected the US to enter the war andwas willing to sacrifice American lives for the
Allied cause. Wilson knew there was a risk of war.
From the outset the Germans had been left in no
doubt, and were indeed themselves in no doubt,that to resume unrestricted submarine warfareagainst American ships supplying the Allies would
lead to war with the US. Expecting to win the
war before America could carry military weight in
Europe, the kaiser, urged by the German mili-
tary, nevertheless on 9 January 1917 ﬁnally choseto use this weapon.Wilson had wished to save America’s strengthso as to ensure a just and permanent peace after
war was over. The war, he believed, would leave
the world exhausted, ready to listen to his wordsof reason. To gain his end, he had attempted asa ﬁrst step to lead the warring nations to a com-
promise peace through his personal mediation.
But war was, nevertheless, eventually forced on
him by the German military leaders.On 22 January 1917, after the failure of hislast effort to mediate, Wilson still proclaimed a
vision of a ‘peace without victory’ and a new
world order or League of Nations to ensure that
peace would prevail. Nine days later the Germans
publicly announced their intention to attack allneutral shipping. Wilson could not ignore thechallenge, but his reaction stopped short of war.
The next blow to his attempt to keep out of war
was the revelation of the so-called Zimmermann
telegram, a message from the German foreignminister to the Mexicans encouraging them to goto war with the US and to recover their lost ter-
ritories in alliance with Germany. The telegram
had been intercepted by British intelligence and
published on 1 March. Anger and indignation
swept America. A few days later American cargoships were sunk without warning by German sub-marines. Still Wilson hesitated. In the conﬁden-
tial documents and private papers of this time
there is no hint of enthusiasm for war on Wilson’s
part, though his Cabinet were now unanimouslyin favour. But on 2 April 1917 Wilson submittedto Congress a request to recognise that Germany
had made war on the US, which both Houses of
Congress approved on 6 April 1917.110THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
Even so, President Wilson still maintained aseparate status on behalf of the US. He did notsimply join the alliance; the US became an ‘associ-
ated power’, Wilson thereby retaining a free diplo-
matic hand. He would pursue his goal of arriving
at a just peace by other means. The Americanpeople were not making war on the Germanpeople but on their militarily crazed rulers.
Wilson’s faith in American democracy made him
believe rather naively that he could appeal to the
peoples to follow his ideals if the governments of
the Allies or former enemies should place obsta-cles in the way of the just peace he envisioned.The US was not ready for war in April 1917.Its military preparations, especially its great naval
expansion, as well as its war plans, had been
designed to secure American safety against theeventual victors of the First World War, whetherled by Britain or Germany. Some military men
believed the Germans could land more than a
million men in the US should they decide to
invade it; the navy estimate was a more sober200,000. The US navy thus built a great battle-ship ﬂeet ‘second to none’ – that is, equal in size
to the British – to protect the US from invasion
after the First World War had ended. America’s
military preparations were particularly ill-suited
for the war it now joined. The Allies did not needany more battleships, but they were desperatelyshort of troops on the western front. Wilson had
forbidden war plans of intervention in the First
World War before April 1917; now everything
had to be improvised.The impact of American military interventionin Europe was not felt for a year. Not until May
1918 were American forces, under General John
Pershing’s command, strong enough to affect the
ﬁghting on the western front. It was just such a
breathing space the German high command hadcounted on to force Britain and France to theirknees.Along the battleﬁelds of France the year 1917again brought no result but continued to grindup hundreds of thousands of men and theirweapons. General Robert Georges Nivelle, who
had replaced Joffre in all but name as French
commander-in-chief, planned a great springoffensive to be coordinated with Russian andItalian offensives. The British army had nowgrown to 1,200,000 men and the French to
2,000,000; together with the Belgians the Allies
now enjoyed a superiority of 3,900,000 over
2,500,000 Germans. The Germans stood on thedefensive in the west but frustrated the Frenchand British efforts in the spring and summer of
1917 to break through their lines and rout their
armies. Nivelle’s failure resulted in widespread
demoralisation among the French troops. The
French nation, which had withstood so much intwo and a half years of war, appeared, during thespring of 1917, to lose its cohesion and unity of
purpose. Soldiers mutinied, bitter at the spectacle
of Paris, with its cafés and boulevards and smart
ladies untroubled by war. Bitterness and despair,fear of mutilation and death, reopened oldwounds of social schism.The collapse of French morale was localisedand General Henri Philippe Pétain’s skilful han-
dling of the situation, and the belief he instilledthat the war would in future be fought with moreconsideration for the value of human life, brought
the mutinies under control. Of the 30,000 to
40,000 mutineers forty-nine were shot to serve as
an example. In the summer of 1917 the ‘sacred
union’, the French political truce, ended. Follow-ing the lead of Russian Bolsheviks, French social-ists now spoke of compromise peace. At this
critical juncture President Raymond Poincaré
chose as head of government, hated though he
was by the socialists, the 76-year-old veteranpolitician Georges Clemenceau, who embodiedthe spirit of fighting the war to victory. The
country responded once more.For the British and Canadians who bore thebrunt of the ﬁghting during the summer and

autumn of 1917 it was a bitter year, and theircommander Field Marshal Lord Haig was criti-cised for the unprecedented losses sustained in
the offensives in Flanders. In November he
reached the deserted village of Passchendaele less
than ten miles from his starting point. Pass-chendaele came to symbolise the apparentlypointless slaughter. Romance in war had long 
ago vanished in the sodden, rat-infested trenches,
death was a daily expectation.1THE GREAT WAR II111
By the autumn of 1917 three of the now sixgreat powers at war were on the point of militaryand economic collapse. The Austrian half of the
Dual Monarchy was desperately short of food; the
Habsburg army could not without German help
sustain the war on all fronts. The new emperor,Charles I, was secretly seeking a way out of thewar. On the other side, the Italians were also soon
in desperate plight. Suffering 340,000 casualties,
the Italian army was defeated at the battle of
Caporetto in October 1917, but with some
British and French help recovered to man a newline of defence.One of the great powers, Russia, did collapse.The revolution that overthrew the tsar in March
1917 had not taken it out of the war immediately.
The new provisional government intended toﬁght it more energetically and successfully thanbefore. But Alexander Kerensky, war minister of
the government and later its leader, could not
with ﬁne speeches make up for Russia’s exhaus-
tion and the mismanagement of the ‘home front’. The Russian summer offensive which heordered turned into a rout. In November 1917
the Bolsheviks seized power and called for peace
immediately ‘without annexations and without
indemnities’. Russia was out of the war, a stunning
blow for the Allies.Nineteen-seventeen was a disastrous year forthe Allies. Only on the oceans did they win what
for Britain and France was a battle for survival.
The Germans only once seriously challenged the
battleship might of the British navy. The result-ing battle of Jutland in May 1916 was claimed byboth sides as a victory, but the German ﬂeet did
not again challenge the British navy whereas
Britain continued to rule above the waves and
maintain its blockade of Germany. The real
danger to the Allies was the ‘blockade’ imposedbelow the water’s surface by German submarines.At ﬁrst it looked as though the Germans would
sink enough ships to knock Britain and France
out of the war by cutting the Atlantic supply line,
for they sank 212 ships in February 1917 and arecord 335 ships, totalling 847,000 tons, in April.By convoying, ships losses were reduced to 107
ships by December. This was the damage that
some 100 German submarines inflicted. Whatwould have happened if the Germans had con-centrated on this effective offensive weaponbefore the war instead of wasting resources on the
prestigious German battleship ﬂeet? They were to
repeat the error in the Second World War.During the grim winter of 1917 and 1918,widespread disaffection and doubts whether 
the war could ever be won, led to new calls 
for peace from all sides. Lenin had nothing to loseby calling the labouring masses in Europe to revolution and to bring to an end the capitalist
imperialist war of their masters. Lloyd George,
determined to ﬁght until the German rulers were
defeated, responded, to still the doubts in Britain,
by delivering a speech in January 1918 to the
British Trades Union Congress. Its keynote was
moderation and an insistence that the central
powers give up all their conquests so that the
sanctity of treaties be upheld. Lloyd George’s
speech was overshadowed a few days later, on 8
January 1918, by President Wilson’s famous
Fourteen Points setting out in a similar way the
basis of peace. The worldwide appeal of theFourteen Points lay in their lofty design for a newera of international relations. The world led by
the US and Wilson’s ‘new diplomacy’ would ‘be
made ﬁt and safe to live in’; every nation would
‘determine its own institutions, be assured of
justice and fair dealing by the other peoples of 
the world as against force and selﬁsh aggression’.
But the speciﬁc Russian, British and American
peace proclamations, with their insistence on 
the restoration of conquered territory, all pre-

supposed the defeat of Germany. No German 
could regard as a ‘compromise’ giving up all the 
territory still ﬁrmly occupied.In 1918 it appeared likely that the Allies wouldbe defeated rather than Germany. The generalsHindenburg and Ludendorff had established a
virtual dictatorship in Germany and marshalled all
resources in a country exhausted by war. In
March 1918 Ludendorff mounted a powerful
offensive in the west; during April, May and June
German troops broke through and once more
came close to Paris. The cost in casualties was
again huge: 800,000 Germans and more than a
million Allied troops.This turned out to beimper-
112THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
ial Germany’s last bid for victory, though theAllies, commanded now by Marshal FerdinandFoch, did not know it.The Allied counter-offensives found a weak-ened enemy losing the will to ﬁght. The greatest
defeatism was not, however, to be found on the
battlefront but among the so recently reveredGerman generals, Hindenburg and Ludendorff.Germany’s allies were collapsing in September
1918. The Turkish army was defeated in Palestine.
The Bulgarians could not resist an Allied advance
from Greece and requested an armistice. Though
Austrian troops were still stoutly defending theItalian front, the Dual Monarchy was disintegrat-ing and its various nationalities were proclaiming
their independence. In France, the arrival of newmasses of fresh American troops had not onlyblunted Germany’s earlier thrust against Paris, butﬁlled the German high command with a sense of
hopelessness. Successful Allied offensives broke
their last will to resist.Ludendorff, towards the close of September1918, demanded that the government in Berlinshould secure an immediate armistice to save the
army. In Berlin the politicians tried to win a little
time. Later, Ludendorff propagated the lie, so
useful to the Nazis, that the army had been
‘stabbed in the back’. The truth is that Ludendorffwished to end a war that was militarily lost whilethe army still preserved its discipline and cohesion.
He got his way. On 11 November 1918 the last
shot was ﬁred in France.1THE GREAT WAR II113
The history of the period from the armistice inNovember 1918 until the conclusion of the
majority of the peace treaties a year later has a
dual aspect. On the one hand the victors, assem-bled in Paris, argued about peace terms to beimposed on Germany and its allies; they knew
that after four years of war and all the changes it
had brought about, the people of the West
longed for an immediate and a stable peace. At
Paris too, decisions would be taken to reconstructthe map not only of Europe, but also of theMiddle East, Africa and China. A new framework
of conducting international relations would be
created by establishing the League of Nations. 
All this represents just one side of the historicaldevelopment of this critical period.The other side of the picture was that eastern,central and southern Europe was daily becoming
more disorganised; in Turkey a nationalist revo-
lution would reject the peace terms altogether;
China continued to disintegrate, rent by internaldissension and the pressure of the Japanese andthe West. The future of Russia and the ultimate
size of the territories that would fall under Soviet
control was one of the biggest uncertainties of all.
With the end of the war and the collapse of thedefeated rulers there was a threat of anarchy.National and social conﬂicts erupted in revolu-
tion. In Russia the war had not ended in time to
save the country from internal violence. For how
much of the rest of Europe was it now too lateas well? No previous war had ended in such chaos.The peacemakers thus did not preside over anempty map of the world waiting for settlement in
the light of their decision reached around the
conference table.The great powers no longer disposed of hugevictorious armies. These were being rapidly
demobilised and war-weary peoples were not
ready to allow their leaders to gather fresh mass
armies. The leaders who mattered, the ‘big three’
– Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau – as therepresentatives of democracies, were dependenton assemblies and electorates and became increas-
ingly conscious of the limits of their ability simply
to follow the dictates of their own reasoning.
Another ‘Europe’ and ‘Asia’ were taking shapebeyond the control of the victors at Paris. Theywere shaped by their own local antagonisms.When the peace conference opened on 18 January1919, just two months after the signing of the
armistices with Turkey, Austria, Hungary andGermany, obviously the problem that mostweighed on Wilson, Clemenceau and Lloyd
George was the future of Germany. The armistice
terms had been harsh, but fell short of demanding
unconditional surrender. The German govern-
ment had applied to Wilson for an armistice on thebasis of the Fourteen Points, after Ludendorff and
Hindenburg had suddenly declared that the army
was in no condition to hold out a moment longer.
In accordance with Wilson’s clearly expressed replythat the terms to be imposed on Germany wouldChapter 11PEACEMAKING IN AN UNSTABLE WORLD,
1918–23be harsher still if the kaiser remained in power, thegenerals themselves had cooperated in persuadingthe kaiser to abdicate and depart for exile in the
Netherlands. And they were also ready to cooper-

ate with the new government of Social Democrats
in Berlin headed by Friedrich Ebert. Hindenburgand his generals brought the German armies homefrom France and Belgium in good order. They
were received more as victors than as defeated
troops by the German population. But, once on
German soil, these once great armies simply dis-

solved; they did not wait to be demobilised accord-
ing to plans which did not exist. They just wenthome. Only in the east, in Poland and the Baltic,
were there still army units left sufﬁciently powerful,

in the chaotic conditions of this region of Europe
caught up in civil wars and national conﬂicts, to
constitute a decisive military factor. To combatBolshevism, the Allied armistice conditions actu-

ally required the Germans to remain in occupation
of the eastern and Baltic territories until Allied
troops could be spared to take over their responsi-
bilities as guardians against the ‘reds’.Despite the changes in Germany and theproclamation of a republic, the Allied attitude in
Paris did not noticeably alter. Whether ‘Junkers’
or ‘Social Democrats’, the Allies continued to
regard them as arrogant and dangerous Germans,and treated them accordingly. But they also dealtwith the Germans at a distance, rejecting the
responsibility of occupying the country and con-
ﬁning themselves to the strategic occupation of
part of the Rhineland alone. Considering the con-dition of threatening anarchy, the Allies contin-ued to be haunted by the fear that the Germans
only wanted to use the armistice as a breathing
space to reorganise and resume the war. But there
were no German armies any longer in existence
in 1919 that could hope to put up a defence evenagainst the reduced strength of the Allied armies.Yet the Allies kept up the ﬁercest pressure during
the weeks of the armistice. The blockade was
maintained from November 1918 through that
winter until March 1919; later this proved a goodpropaganda point for the Nazis, who exaggeratedAllied callousness.During that ﬁrst winter and spring of 1918–19,
Germany was left to survive as best as it could. Thenew democratic republic, soon known as theWeimar Republic after the town in which its constitution-making parliament met, could not
have had a worse start. Within Germany itself, a
vacuum of power, similar to that in Russia in 1917,
which rival groups sought to ﬁll, threatened stabil-
ity. Everyone was aware of the parallel, not leastthe new chancellor, Ebert. But Ebert, once a hum-

ble saddle-maker, was a politician of considerable
experience and strength. He was determined not
to be cast in the role of the Russian Kerensky. For
Ebert, the most important tasks ahead were toestablish law and order, revive industry and agriculture so that the German people could live,
preserve German unity and ensure that the ‘revo-

lution’ that had begun with the kaiser’s departure
should itself lead to the orderly transfer of powerto a democratically elected parliamentary assembly.Ebert was tough, and determined that Germany
should become a parliamentary democracy and not
a communist state. This was a programme that
won the support of the army generals, who recog-
nised that the Social Democratic republic would beboth the best immediate defence against anarchy
and Bolshevism and a screen acceptable to the
Allies behind which Germany’s traditional forces
could regroup.Why did the Social Democrats leave the revo-lution half-finished, retain the army and the imperial administration, and leave society and
wealth undisturbed? Did they not thereby seal
their own doom and pave the way for the Nazis
a decade later? With hindsight one may legiti-mately ask would Germany’s future have beenbetter with a ‘completed’ communist revolution?
The question is deceptively simple. It is unlikely
that the Allies would have allowed the commu-
nists to retain power in Germany; an extensive
Allied occupation might then have resulted afterall. The breakdown of order within Germany leftthe sincerely democratic socialists isolated and so
forced them to seek cooperation with the forces
that had upheld the kaiser’s Germany hitherto.
They had no other practical alternative.A communist seizure of power would have rep-resented the will of only a small minority of
Germans; the great majority, including the work-
ers, did not desire to emulate Bolshevik Russia. All1PEACEMAKING IN AN UNSTABLE WORLD, 1918–23115
over Germany in November 1918 ‘workers’ andsoldiers’ councils’ formed themselves sponta-neously. The movement began in Kiel where
sailors of the imperial navy mutinied, unwilling at
the end of the war to risk their lives senselessly to
satisfy their ofﬁcers’ sense of honour. The ofﬁcershad planned to take the High Seas Fleet out to seato engage the British in one last glorious suicidal
battle. From Kiel the setting up of German soviets
spread to Hamburg and other parts, then to Berlin
and the rest of Germany. But not all these self-
proclaimed soldiers’ and workers’ councils, whichclaimed to speak for the people, were in favour ofa Bolshevik state. In many more, moderate social-
ists predominated and those who before the
armistice had been opposed to war (Independent
Socialists) now joined with the majority who had supported war. In others the IndependentSocialists allied with the Spartacists, the name the
communist faction led by Karl Liebknecht and
Rosa Luxemburg had assumed.In Berlin, the capital, the crucial strugglebetween the socialist factions was decided. Eberthad assumed the chancellorship, constitution-
ally accepting this ofﬁce from Prince Max von

Baden, the last imperial chancellor. His fellow
socialist Phillip Scheidemann, in the confusion 
that followed, proclaimed a republic to anticipateLiebknecht. Liebknecht simultaneously pro-
claimed the ‘socialist republic’ to his followers.
Ebert would have preferred a constitutional mon-
archy, but now the die was cast. Ebert and
Scheidemann won over the Independent Socialistswith concessions that would allow the BerlinSoldiers’ and Workers’ Council ‘all power’ until
the constituent parliament met. The constituent
parliament was elected early in January 1919 and
assembled in Weimar in February to begin its
labours of drawing up a constitution for the wholeof Germany.All this gives a false impression of orderliness.During the winter and spring following the
armistice it was uncertain whether Ebert would
survive. Germany was torn by political strife ofunprecedented ferocity, and separatist movementsin several regions even suggested that Ger-
many might disintegrate. In the second-largest
state, Bavaria, political strife was unfolding. TheIndependent Socialist leader Kurt Eisner had leda revolution of workers and soldiers in Munich,proclaimed the republic of Bavaria, and deposed
the royal house of Wittelsbach. All over Germany
the princes disappeared. They had counted for so
little, their disappearance made little impact now.Eisner’s republic was not communist. Though hehad been opposed to the war, he was at one with
Ebert in desiring a democratic Bavaria, in a
Germany of loosely ‘federated’ states. Elections
duly held in January and February 1919 in
Bavaria resulted in the defeat of Eisner’s Indep-endent Socialist Party. On his way to the Bavarianparliament to lay down ofﬁce, Eisner was brutally
murdered in the street. This was the signal for
civil war in Bavaria, which slid into anarchy and
extremism.December 1918 and January 1919 were thedecisive months in Berlin, too. There the Sparta-
cists decided to carry the revolution further 
than the Social Democrats were prepared to go.
The Spartacists attempted an insurrection inDecember, seizing Berlin’s public buildings, andthe Social Democrats, still having no efﬁcient mil-
itary force of their own, appealed to the army.
Irregular volunteer army units were formed, the
so-called Free Corps; all sorts of freebooters, ex-
ofﬁcers and men who enjoyed violence joined;there were few genuine Social Democrats amongthese paramilitary units. The scene was set for
ﬁghting among the factions, for bloodshed and
brutality. The Spartacist rising was put down and
Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were murderedas they emerged from their hiding place. Therising, followed by strikes and fresh disorders,
seriously threatened Ebert’s government in the
new year of 1919.In Bavaria there were three rival governments –two Bolshevik and one majority Socialist. Theshowdown came in April 1919. The moderateSocialists called on the Free Corps units for mili-
tary assistance. The Bolsheviks were bloodily sup-
pressed and in Munich many innocent people lost
their lives. It was a tragedy for Germany and theworld that the Weimar Republic was founded inbloodshed, that the Social Democrats had to call
on the worst anti-democratic elements in the state
for support. This left a legacy of suspicion and116THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
bitterness among the working people, split theSocialists and so, in the end, helped the right-wingextremists to power. The communists blamed the
Social Democrats, the Social Democrats the com-
munists. Representative constitutional govern-

ment survived but at what proved to be a heavyprice.In Paris there was a keen awareness that to delaythe making of peace would endanger stability
even further. Germany should be presented with
the terms and given a short period for a writtensubmission embodying their reply. There shouldbe no meaningful negotiations with the Germans.
Better a ‘dictated’ peace quickly than a long-
drawn-out wrangle that allowed the Germans to
exploit Allied differences. It was a remarkableachievement that despite these serious differences– the French, in particular, looked for more
extensive territorial guarantees and reparations –
in the short space of four months an agreed treatywas presented to the Germans on 7 May 1919.This represented the compromises reached byWilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau. The
Italians took little part, deeply offended and dis-
satisﬁed with their territorial gains in general and
the rejection of their claim for Fiume in particu-lar. There was no set agenda for the negotiationsin Paris. The crucial decisions were taken by
Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau and 
then the details were left to the experts who
accompanied the statesmen in large numbers.Clemenceau was aware of France’s basic weak-ness, inferior in population and industrial pro-duction to a Germany that was bound to recover.
How to provide then for French security? The
break-up and partition of Germany were not seri-
ously considered, though a separate Rhinelandwould have served French interests. Germany,albeit deprived of Alsace-Lorraine and of territory
in the east, remained intact as potentially the most
powerful European continental state.1PEACEMAKING IN AN UNSTABLE WORLD, 1918–23117
The Versailles conference. The Peacemakers. Wilson on the left, Clemenceau, Orlando and Lloyd George. © CorbisOne of the few undertakings of the Allies, andincorporated in the Fourteen Points, was toreconstitute an independent Polish nation and so
to undo the eighteenth-century partition of
Poland by Russia, Austria and Prussia. The carry-
ing out of this pledge created great difﬁculties inredrawing Germany’s eastern frontier. The Ger-man city of Danzig was separated from Germany
and turned into an autonomous free city for
which the League of Nations accepted certain
responsibilities and over which Poland enjoyed
speciﬁc rights. The wedge of Polish territory tothe sea created the ‘Polish corridor’ which hence-forth separated Germany from East Prussia. In
parts of Silesia a plebiscite in March 1921 and the
League decision in 1922 decided where the
precise frontier with Poland ran. But the peacetreaty placed several million German-speakingpeoples under foreign rule. In the west, apart
from Alsace-Lorraine and two small territories
which became Belgian, Germany lost no territory;
the Saarland, with its valuable coal, was placedunder the League, and the French were grantedthe rights to the mines with the provision that
after ﬁfteen years a plebiscite would allow the
population to choose their own future.An important guarantee of French security was the requirement that the Germans were notpermitted to fortify or station troops in theRhineland; all the German territory west of the
Rhine and bridgeheads across the Rhine, more-
over, were occupied by the Allies for ﬁfteen years
and evacuation would only occur in three stagesevery ﬁve years if Germany fulﬁlled the treaty con-ditions of Versailles. But Clemenceau never lost
sight of the fact that France remained, even after
these German losses, inferior to its neighbour in
population and industrial potential, and therefore
militarily as well in the longer term. Clemenceaurealised that France would need the alliance ofBritain and the US even more after 1918. France
had been gravely weakened by the war. With
Bolshevik Russia no longer contributing to the
balance of Europe as tsarist Russia had donebefore 1914, German preponderance on the con-tinent of Europe had potentially increased.Clemenceau struggled in vain with Wilson andLloyd George in Paris to secure more permanentguarantees than were provided by the occupationof the Rhineland, which remained sovereignGerman territory. He accepted in the end that
Germany could not be diminished further in the
west; that France could not attain the Rhine frontier. He feared that, if he refused, Britain andthe US would cease all post-war support of
France. In place of ‘territorial’ guarantees, France
was offered a substitute: the promise of a post-war alliance with Britain and the US. This treaty,concluded in June 1919, was conditional upon
the consent of the Senate of the US. As it turned
out, Clemenceau had received payment with acheque that bounced, though Wilson at the timewas conﬁdent that the Senate would approve.It became, from the French point of view, allthe more vital to write into the treaty provisionsfor restricting the German army and armamentsand to have the means of supervising these pro-
visions to see that they were carried out. But for
how long could this be maintained? The Germanarmy was reduced to a professional force of100,000 men. Such a force was not even ade-
quate to ensure internal security. Add to this the
loss of the High Seas Fleet interned in Britishwaters, a prohibition to build an air force, anAllied control commission to supervise the pro-
duction of light armaments that the Germans
were permitted to manufacture, and the totalpicture is one of military impotence. Finally,Germany lost all its colonies.In Germany there was a tremendous outcry.But already in 1919, among the military and the
more thoughtful politicians, it was realised thatthe sources of Germany’s strength would recover118THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY

GERMANYR.RhineR.SeineR.RhônePORTUGALMEDITERRANEANSEAR.ElbePeace settlements, 1919–23and its industries revive. Opportunities wouldarise to modify or circumvent the restrictions
imposed by the ‘dictated’ Versailles Treaty. The
German public focused their anger on the ‘war
guilt’ article of the treaty. It was misunderstoodand considered out of context. It stated thatGermany had imposed war on the Allies by its
aggression and that of its allies. Today, looking at
the July crisis of 1914, there can be no real doubt
that Germany and Austria-Hungary were the
‘aggressors’. What the Germans could not beexpected to know was that this article (231) andthe one that followed represented a compromise
between the Allies on the question of reparations.The French and British wished the Germans to pay the ‘whole cost’ of the war. France’s north-eastern industrial region had been devas-tated while Germany was untouched. Britain and
France had incurred heavy war debts which the
US insisted had to be repaid. France and Britain
had to be satisfied with Article 231 wherebyGermany and its allies accepted responsibility forcausing all the loss and damage. But in Article
232 the Germans were not required actually to
pay for ‘the whole cost of the war’. The Germans
would have to pay only for losses caused to civil-
ians and their property. This represented a victoryfor Wilson; Allied public opinion would beappeased by the ‘war guilt’ clause.Little thought was extended to German publicopinion. No agreement on a total sum was reach-
ed. This was left for a Reparations Commission to determine by May 1921. The Germans werepresented with the treaty draft on 7 May 1919.
Their voluminous protests and counter-proposals
delivered on 29 May were considered, a small
number of concessions made. They were then 
presented with the unalterable ﬁnal draft in theform of a virtual ultimatum on 16 June. Unable toresume the war, the Germans formally accepted
and signed the treaty on 28 June 1919. A week
earlier, the German ﬂeet, interned in Scapa Flow,
was scuttled by the crews.Had the Allies acted wisely in their treatment ofGermany? The ﬁnancial thinking of the Allies, led
by the US, lacked realism. Reparations and war
debts, the growth of trade and employment were
international and not purely German problems.
John Maynard Keynes, the distinguished econo-mist, who had been sent to Paris to serve as one ofBritain’s ﬁnancial experts, later in his famous book
on the peace treaty, The Economic Consequences ofthe Peace, condemned the financial provisions.The total amount of reparations payable byGermany ﬁxed in May 1921 – 132,000 milliongold marks – was actually not so excessive. But
only a prosperous, stable Germany in a relatively
free international market could contribute to gen-
eral European prosperity. Lloyd George under-stood that to ‘punish’ Germany ﬁnancially wouldcreate a powerful competitor in export markets as
Germany sought the means to pay. If there was 
to be security from Germany in the longer term,
then one way was to reduce German power by
dividing the country; but this offended prevailingviews of nationality. The other way was to ensurethat Germany’s political development would lead
to a fundamental change of attitudes: genuine
democracy coupled with a renunciation of nation-
alist aspirations. Instead, the peace weakened thedemocratic movement and heightened nationalistfeelings.Besides Germany and Austria-Hungary, the othergreat power defeated in war was Russia. The West
was perplexed by the Russian problem. Lenin’s120THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY

Russia was openly hostile both to the victors andthe vanquished of 1918. They were all, in Lenin’seyes, imperialist bourgeois powers ripe for revo-
lution. There were voices in the West which called
for an all-out effort to kill the poisonous inﬂuence
of ‘Red’ Russia from the outset. But there wasalso sympathy for its plight. Confused attemptswere made by France, Britain and the US to
provide support for the anti-Bolshevik forces in
Russia and so the West became embroiled,
though only feebly, in the chaos of the Russian
Civil War.The communist seizure of power in November1917 had initially gained control only of Petrograd
and Moscow. That seizure was not given the stamp
of approval by the rest of Russia. Lenin had
allowed elections for a constitutional parliament,arranged by Kerensky’s provisional government.This ‘constituent assembly’ which met in January
1918 was the most representative ever elected, and
the mass of the peasantry turned to the Socialist
Revolutionaries who constituted the majority ofthe elected representatives. Only a quarter of themwere Bolsheviks. Lenin had no intention of allow-

ing the assembly to undo the Bolshevik revolution.
The assembly was forcibly dispersed on his orders.
It was the end of any genuine democratic process.
During 1918 Lenin was determined that theBolsheviks should seize power throughout Russia,and dealt ruthlessly with opposition and insurrec-

tion against Bolshevik rule. Lenin was not held
back by any moral scruple. Every other considera-

tion had to be subordinated then to the secureachievement of Bolshevik power, which would actas a torch to set alight revolution in the more
advanced West. Lenin’s eyes were ﬁxed on the

world. Without a world revolution, he believed,
the purely Russian Revolution would not survive.Lenin met the force of opponents with forceand terror. The terrorist police, which Lenin setup in December 1917, was called the Cheka. This
organisation was given the right to kill opponents
and even those suspected of opposition, without
benefit of trial, by summary execution. Theauthority of the state now stood behind the exer-cise of brute lawless power. No questions would
be asked and the killing of some innocents was
accepted as inevitable in the interests of the con-solidation of communist power in Russia – ‘thegreat goal’. Lenin’s successors were to accept suchexercise of terror, which reached its climax under
Stalin in the 1930s, not as a temporary necessity
in conflict but as a permanent part of Soviet
control over the population.Soviet terror included the killing of the tsarand his family in July 1918. Soviet ferocity was
partly responsible for resolute centres of oppo-
sition to the Bolsheviks. Already before the 
peace of Brest-Litovsk some of the non-Russian
peoples around the whole periphery of the oldRussian Empire had wanted independence. WithGerman help in 1918, states were being formed
in the Baltic (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia); Finland
became completely independent and the local
Bolshevik forces were defeated; the Ukrainebecame an independent state; in central Asia inde-pendence was claimed by the peoples living in
these regions; only Poland had been promised its
independence and sought to make good its claims
and, much more, to create a large Polish nationby carving out territories from Russia proper. Inopposition to ‘Red’ Petrograd, to Moscow and
the central region controlled by the Bolsheviks,
other Russian forces, led by tsarist generals,
formed in many parts of Russia, sometimes in
cooperation but also sometimes in conﬂict withlocal nationalist forces. These disparate militarygroups and armies became known collectively as
White Russians, which suggested they possessed
more coherence than was actually the case. In
many regions there was a complete breakdown oflaw and order and independent brigand armieslooted and lived off the countryside.Among these independent and lawless armiesone of the strangest was the Czech Legion (of
some 50,000 ofﬁcers and men) which had been
formed in Russia from prisoners of war to ﬁght for
the Allied cause. After the Russian peace withGermany the Czech Legion attempted to leave
Russia by way of the Trans-Siberian railway and the
port of Vladivostok in Siberia. Fearing Bolshevik
intentions, they came into open conﬂict with the
Bolsheviks sent to disarm them. In Siberia theythen formed a nucleus around which White
Russian forces gathered. The self-proclaimed

disciplined and frequently insubordinate troopswas Admiral Kolchak. The Allies had ﬁrst inter-
vened in Russia in the hope of reopening a war
front in the east in order to relieve pressure on the
western front. After the conclusion of the war with
Germany, Britain and France were unsure whetherthe Bolsheviks or the White Russians would ulti-
mately gain power. Lloyd George’s instincts at
Paris were sound in that he did not wish to make
an enemy of the Bolsheviks. He proposed Allied
‘mediation’ between the Russians ﬁghting each

other quite irreconcilably. British intervention was small and limited. The French made a moredetermined but useless attempt, cooperating with
White Russian forces in the Ukraine from a base 
in Odessa. The Japanese landed a large force 
in Siberia, pursuing imperialist ambitions of theirown; and the Americans a smaller force at Vladi-vostok, ostensibly to rescue the Czech Legion but
really to watch the Japanese. Allied intervention
was too small to make a signiﬁcant impact on the

outcome of the civil war in Russia.Lenin left it to Trotsky as commissar for warto create a Red Army to complete the conquest
of the former Russian Empire and defeat all the
opposing forces. Their disunity made it easier for
Trotsky to defeat ﬁrst one opponent and then the
next. Nevertheless, his achievement in recreatingan army for the revolution was remarkable. Armydiscipline was reintroduced, as was the death
penalty. Trotsky was no less ruthless than Lenin
in the draconian measures he was ready to take
to achieve discipline. Former tsarist ofﬁcers wererecruited to provide the necessary expertise and‘political commissars’ were attached to the units
to ensure that the armies would continue to ﬁght
for the right cause.Lenin ended the period of civil war in 1920partly by compromise and partly by conquest. Herecognised the independence of the Baltic statesof Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Poland
was, for communist Russia, the most critical
region. Poland was the gateway to Germany, and
so, Lenin believed, the gateway to world revolu-tions. But the Poles proved too strong for theRed Army, though not strong enough to defeat
it decisively. The war between Poland and Russia
lasted from the spring of 1920 until the follow-ing October. Given only limited Allied help, thePoles were really left to win or lose by themselves.At ﬁrst they succeeded spectacularly and reached
Kiev in the Ukraine. The Red Army then drove
them back and for a time Lenin hoped to overrun
Poland altogether and to instal a puppet com-munist government. But at the gates of Warsawthe Red Army was defeated in turn and Lenin 
in 1921 accepted Polish independence. The re-
mainder of the Russian Empire was successfully
brought under communist control and the short-
lived independent states of the Ukraine, Georgiaand Transcaucasia were forcibly incorporated inthe Soviet Union.Communist Russia had failed to spread the rev-olution. The sparks that led to short-lived com-
munist takeovers in Hungary and Bavaria werequickly extinguished. Russia had also failed tothrust through Poland to the West. Equally the
West had failed either to overthrow the Bolsheviks
or to befriend them. For two decades from 1921
to 1941 the Soviet Union remained essentially cutoff, a large self-contained empire following itsown road to modernisation and living in a spirit of
hostile coexistence with the West.Up to the last year of the war the Allies did notdesire to destroy the Habsburg Empire, whichwas seen as a stabilising inﬂuence in south-easternEurope. Wilson’s Fourteen Points had promised
‘autonomous’ development to the peoples of the
empire, not independence. Reform, not destruc-
tion, was the aim of the West. Within the Mon-archy itself the spirit of national independenceamong the Slavs had grown immensely, stimu-
lated by the Bolshevik revolution and the Russian
call for the national independence of all peoples.
Now the Czechs and Slovaks wished to form a
national unit within a Habsburg federal statewhere each nation would enjoy equal rights. TheSlovenes, Croats and Serbs of the Monarchy
wished to form an independent Yugoslav nation
and the Ruthenes demanded freedom from Polish
dependence. The Habsburg dynasty and rulingclasses could not respond adequately to theseaspirations even in the Austrian half of the
Monarchy; it was unthinkable that the Magyars
would accept a sufﬁciently liberal policy to win122THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
over the Slavs, or even that they could have doneso as late as 1917. The Monarchy was tied todualism. Outside the Monarchy, émigrés were
winning the support of the Allies for the setting
up of independent nations. As the Monarchy
weakened under the impact of war, so theseémigré activities grew more important.In 1918 Wilson became gradually converted tothe view that the Czechoslovaks and Yugoslavs
were oppressed nationalities whose efforts for free-

dom deserved sympathy and support. Before the
conclusion of the armistice, the Czechoslovaks hadwon Allied recognition as an ‘Allied nation’,Poland had been promised independence, and the
Yugoslav cause, though not accorded the same
recognition, had at any rate become well publi-

cised. When Austria-Hungary appealed to Wilsonfor an armistice on the basis of the Fourteen Pointsin October 1918, Wilson replied that the situation
had changed and that autonomy for the other
nationalities was no longer sufﬁcient. This was
strictly true. With defeat, the Hungarians and theSlavs all hastened to dissociate themselves from the Germans. Poland and Yugoslavia declared 
their independence as did the Hungarians. The
German Austrians only had one option left, to dis-

sociate Austria from the dynasty, and declare
German Austria a republic. The revolution inVienna was bloodless as Charles I withdrew.The Habsburg Empire broke apart before thearmistice on 3 November 1918 and there was no
way the Allies could have brought it together
again. But in no other part of the world was itmore difficult to reconcile Wilson’s ideals ofnational self-determination and national frontiers
as the different peoples of the Balkans did not live
in tidily delineated lands. There would always be
people who formed majorities and minorities.
The defeat of the dominant Austrians and Hun-garians now determined that they and not theSlavs, Romanians and Italians would constitute
new minorities within the ‘successor states’ of the
Habsburg Empire.The Allies at Paris modified the centralEuropean frontiers created by strong national lead-
ers, attempted to ensure good treatment of
minorities and enforced punitive conditions on the
defeated Hungarians and German Austrians; in itsessentials, however, power had been transferred tothe new nations already. Austria was reduced to asmall state of 6.5 million inhabitants. The peace
treaties forbade their union with Germany. The
principle of national self-determination was vio-

lated as far as the defeated were concerned. TheItalians had been promised the natural frontier of the Brenner Pass, even though this meant incor-

porating nearly a quarter of a million German-
speaking Tyrolese into Italy. The new Czecho-
slovak state was granted its ‘historic frontiers’,
which included Bohemia, and another 3.5 millionGerman-speaking Austrians and also Rutheneswere divided between the Czechs and Poles and
separated from the Ukraine. Hungary was reduced
to the frontiers where only Magyars predomi-
nated. Hungary was now a small state of some 8 million, nearly three-quarters of a millionMagyars being included in the Czechoslovak 
state. The Hungarians remained ﬁercely resentful

of the enforced peace, and their aspirations to
revise the peace treaties aroused the fears of neigh-
bouring Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.A peace settlement in the Near East eluded the‘peacemakers’ altogether. With the defeat of the
Ottoman Empire and the Turkish acceptance of an
armistice on 30 October 1918, the Arab peoplehad high hopes of achieving their independence.The Americans, British and French were commit-

ted by public declarations to the goal of setting 
up governments that would express the will of the
peoples of the former Turkish Empire. But, duringthe war Britain and France had also secretly agreed on a division of inﬂuence in the Middle

East. To complicate the situation still further, the
British government had promised the Zionists 
‘the establishment in Palestine of a National 
Home for the Jewish people’ in what becameknown as the Balfour Declaration (2 November1917). How were all these conﬂicting aspirations

now to be reconciled? Wars and insurrections dis-

turbed Turkey and the Middle East for the next
ﬁve years.The Arabs were denied truly independentstates except in what became Saudi Arabia. The
other Arab lands were placed under French and
British tutelage as ‘mandates’ despite the wishes1PEACEMAKING IN AN UNSTABLE WORLD, 1918–23123
of the inhabitants. Iraq and Palestine becameBritish mandates and Syria and Lebanon, French.Within a few years, the Arab states of Syria,
Lebanon, Transjordan and Iraq emerged but
remained ﬁrmly under British and French control.Peace with Turkey proved even more difﬁ-
cult to achieve. The Sultan’s government hadaccepted the peace terms of the Treaty of Sèvres
in August 1920, but a Turkish general, Mustafa
Kemal, the founder of modern Turkey, led a
revolt against the peace terms. The Greeks, mean-
while, were seeking to fulﬁl their own ambitionsand landed troops in Turkish Asia Minor. Thedisunity of the Allies added to the confusion and
made the enforcement of the Treaty of Sèvres
quite impossible. By skilled diplomacy – by divid-
ing the Anglo-French alliance, and by securingsupplies from the French and Russians – Kemalgathered and inspired a Turkish national move-
ment to free Turkey from the foreign invasions.
He defeated the Greeks in September 1922 and
then turned on the British troops stationed in theStraits of Constantinople. In October 1922 LloydGeorge, unsupported by his former allies, was
forced to accept Kemal’s demands for a revision
of the peace treaty. This was accomplished by the
Lausanne Conference and a new treaty in July
1923 which freed Turkey from foreign occupa-tion and interference. Shortly afterwards Turkeywas proclaimed a republic and Kemal became the
ﬁrst president. Of all the defeated powers, Turkey
alone challenged successfully the terms of peace
the Allies sought to impose.It was clear to President Wilson that the effort ofreaching peace had involved unsatisfactory com-
promises and that Allies and former enemies were
both deeply dissatisﬁed with some of the terms.
One ally, Italy, had left the conference over thedecision not to yield the port of Fiume to it, andthe Italians returned only for the formal con-

cluding ceremonies. The Japanese were offended
by their failure to have a ‘racial equality’ clause
incorporated in the Covenant of the League ofNations. The Hungarians and Germans did notregard the treaties as just and were determined to
revise them. Wilson nevertheless pinned his hope
for the future on the League of Nations.The real purpose of the League of Nations wasto ﬁnd a better way of solving disputes that couldlead to war than by the kind of devastating con-
ﬂict through which the world had just passed. In
the League great states and small states were to
ﬁnd security with justice. Within ten years of itsfounding, these high hopes seemed unlikely to befulﬁlled. Britain, France and the US would not
risk war in the 1930s to uphold the League’s
ideals when the aggressors were other great
powers – Japan, Italy and Germany and the Soviet
Union. The strength of the League depended onits members and not on the rules and procedureslaid down; to be sure, if these had been applied
and observed they would most likely have pre-
served peace. At the heart of the Covenant of the
League lay Article 10 whereby all the membersundertook to preserve the existing independenceof all other members. Furthermore, if there were
aggression against a member, or a threat of such
aggression, then the Council of League would
‘advise’ on the best way in which members couldfulfil their obligations. Possible sanctions ofincreasing severity were set out in other articles
which, if adopted, would hurt the aggressor. 
The weakness of the League was that each
member could in effect decide whether or not to
comply with a Council request to apply sanctions.Furthermore, the Council, consisting of perma-nent great-power members together with some
smaller states, could act only unanimously, so that
any one of its members could block all action.
The League was not a world government, lackedarmed force of its own and remained dependenton the free cooperation of its members to behave
according to its principles and to join with others
in punishing those states that did not.It was a heavy blow to the League when the USrepudiated Wilson’s efforts. Before a treaty towhich the US is a party can be valid, a two-thirdsmajority of the Senate has to vote in its favour.
There were genuine misgivings about the wide-
ranging but unique commitment of Article 10,
whereby the US would literally be obliged ‘to pre-serve’ the independence of every nation in theworld. The president might have won the neces-
sary majority if he had dealt tactfully with the
opposition. But he would not admit the obvious124THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
gap between the utopian aims of the League andrealistic national policies. Wilson rejected thecompromise of accepting Senate reservations to
the treaty and toured the country in September
1919 to appeal over the heads of the Senate to the
people. On his return to Washington, he suffereda severe stroke. The chance of compromise withthe Senate was lost. The treaty without amend-ments was lost twice when the Senate voted in
November 1919 and March 1920. But this did
not mean that the US was as yet ‘isolationist’. The
US would have joined the League with no more1PEACEMAKING IN AN UNSTABLE WORLD, 1918–23125

The treaty ofalliance with France signed together with Britain
at Paris in 1919 is often lost sight of in Wilson’s
debacle over the League. It was Wilson who lost
all interest in it. For him it was a question of theLeague or nothing. The alliance treaty betweenthe US, France and Britain, if it had been ratiﬁed
by the Senate, could have altered subsequent his-
tory. Opponents of universal and vague commit-
ments to the League, such as the powerful Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge, were in favour of this treatyof alliance or, as it was called, guarantee. But thetreaty was never submitted to a Senate vote.The presidential elections of 1920 reﬂected thenew mood of the people. With the slogan ‘Return
to Normalcy’ the Republican candidate WarrenHarding won by a large margin. The Americanpeople turned their backs on Wilson’s leadershipand Wilson’s vision of America’s mission in theworld.The conditions for a stable peace had not beenlaid by 1920. The French, deprived of the treaty
of guarantee, were well aware how far Europe was from achieving any balance of power. Muchnow depended on the attitude the British would
take to the issues of the continent; much, too,
would depend on the course of German history.
Nor had any reconciliation of conﬂicting interests
been achieved in Asia. The Japanese had securedGermany’s former rights in China in the provinceof Shantung and so incensed the Chinese delega-
tion in Paris that it refused to sign the peace treaty
of Versailles. The sure foundations of peace had
not been achieved in 1919. Perhaps it was unre-alistic to expect they would be.126THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
Even before the outbreak of the war, the more dis-cerning conservatives such as Bethmann Hollweg
recognised that imperial Germany must move 
in the direction of a more broadly based consti-tutional monarchy. The kaiser, the big landed and industrial interests and the powerful military
frustrated progressive constitutional policies.
Then it happened with the imminence of defeat
facing Germany in November 1918: the Social
Democrats joined the Cabinet of Prince Max vonBaden; government, it was intended, should infuture be dependent on a Reichstag majority. 
The great change from a semi-authoritarian to 
a parliamentary democracy had taken place 
without a revolution. The revolution had beenanticipated and made unnecessary. The kaiser had left for exile in Holland with his little-loved
family and the consequent vacuum of power had
to be ﬁlled.The peaceful transfer of power was almost suc-
cessful and there can be no doubt that this is whatthe vast majority of the German people desired.They did not want to suffer a civil war and blood-

shed on top of the defeat. They feared revolution,
especially of the kind that had occurred in neigh-

bouring Russia. Indeed, deeply disillusioned by thesuddenness of defeat, they cared little aboutpolitics altogether, wanted law and order and to
keep their possessions. This ‘silent majority’
showed an extraordinary capacity to get on with
their own lives regardless of the wild men, the bat-
talions of mutinied sailors and armed bands of var-
ious political persuasions rushing around in lorries.Life in Berlin during the early days of the republic
went on with everyday orderliness. If shooting
occurred, people sheltered in doorways, while inneighbouring streets others shopped, ate andamused themselves as usual. Prussia had been
renowned for its public orderliness. No one in
their lifetime had experienced violence on the
streets. Now the ordinary Germans coped with the
breakdown of their orderly world by simply ignor-
ing the disorder and turning the other way.Political democracy requires that the majorityfeel a concern for their rights and the rights of
others and are ready to defend them. In Germany
in the early years of the Weimar Republic it waspossible for the committed few who did notshrink from using force to threaten to take over
control of the state, jeopardising peaceful change.
When on 9 November 1918, Prince Max von
Baden announced the abdication of the kaiser 
and handed over his ofﬁce to Ebert who therebybecame chancellor ‘on the basis of the constitu-tion’, the German people were pleased to learn
not that there had been a ‘revolution’, but that
the revolution had been pronounced as having
occurred unbeknown to all but a few. The SocialDemocrats had long ago given up any real inten-tion of seeking revolution. Like the British
Labour Party they were intent on gradual parlia-
mentary and democratic change. They had
become the true heirs of the liberals of ‘the 1848revolution’ including taking pride in German1Chapter 12DEMOCRACY ON TRIALWEIMAR GERMANYnationalism. They had supported the war. No lessa personage than Field Marshal von Hindenburg,testified that Ebert was sound and ‘loved his
fatherland’.But this kind of ‘tame’ revolution did not satisfythe more politically active. In imitation of theRussian example, ‘soldiers’ and workers’ councils’sprang up all over Germany. Ebert humoured
them, knowing that the parliamentary constituent
assembly he planned would soon give the gov-
ernment of the Reich a solidly based and legal
foundation. Then, too, the Social Democratic gov-ernment was so weak that it had no military forcesof its own to resist any group seeking to wrest con-

trol from it. The Spartacists’ insurrections in
December 1918 and January 1919, followed by
political strikes and disorders, although fomentedby a revolutionary party with only little supportamong the workers, nevertheless posed a serious
threat to the Ebert government. With the support
of the army command and irregular Free Corps
bands of soldiers, the violence of the extreme leftwas met with counter-violence and lawless terror.The two Spartacist (communist) leaders, Rosa
Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, were murdered.
Violence continued in other parts of Germany
especially in Berlin and Munich. The Free Corps
units, fanatical opponents both of democracy and of Bolshevism and the forerunners of those who were to support the Nazis, everywhere, with
excessive brutality, suppressed the militant left.The Social Democratic government and therepublic survived. What had maintained it in powerwas the tacit alliance between Field Marshal vonHindenburg and General Wilhelm Groener, the
army chief of staff, with Ebert and his government.
Their motives for cooperating with the socialist
government were to maintain German unity and to
prevent the ‘patriotic’ German Social Democratsfrom being driven from power by the Bolshevik‘internationalists’. They also believed that the tra-

ditions of the Prussian army represented the ‘best’
of Germany and that the new emerging Germany
could be imbued with these qualities provided theReichswehr retained a position of power in thestate.It was a misfortune that the Social Democratswere inevitably stained by the misdeeds of militaryexcess. The communists had not been suppressed,only prevented from seizing power. The commu-nists were never to gain as many votes as the
Social Democrats, but as the Social Democrats
weakened from their high-water mark of support
of 38 per cent of the electorate in 1919, theCommunist Party beneﬁting from the depression,recovered to secure 13 per cent of the vote in
1930, which in the free elections in November
1932 rose to 17 per cent. By then the Social
Democratic support had sunk to 20 per cent.
Figures do not fully reveal how this split of thesocialists handicapped the strengthening of thedemocratic parliamentary republic in the 1920s.
The growth of the Communist Party to the left
of the Social Democrats competing for the
working man’s vote sapped the will of the SocialDemocratic politicians to lead the governments ofthe republic boldly, even though they formed the
single largest party in the Reichstag throughout
the 1920s. After 1919 they enjoyed absolute
majority, so had they wished to govern theywould have had to form coalitions with the ‘bour-geois’ parties of the centre and moderate right.
This, of course, they feared would lay them open
to the cry of having ‘betrayed’ the working class.
The early experiences of the republic also rein-
forced their conclusion that the danger to itsdemocratic existence arose from an extreme left,that is, a communist takeover.We know better now; but the sudden andhuge expansion of the Nazi vote between 1928
and 1932 was entirely unforeseen. The SocialDemocrats were afraid of losing votes to the polit-ical left by collaborating with the ‘bourgeois’
parties in coalition governments; only one of 
the sixteen chancellors after 1920 was a Social
Democrat. Between November 1922 until June
1928 (except for a brief period of three monthsin 1923) – that is, for the greater part of the lifeof the parliamentary republic they had done so
much to create – the Social Democrats refused to
participate in government at all. The parties of the
centre and moderate right formed the basis of allthe coalition governments, sometimes seeking tostrengthen their position in the absence of the
Social Democrats by seeking the more extreme-
right support of the Nationalists. Even so, every128THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
one of the coalitions without the Social Demo-crats was a minority government. They generallylasted only a few months. The major political
parties from the Conservatives to the Centre Party
were either hostile or lukewarm about the new
republic even before the National Socialistsbecame signiﬁcant. The only genuine parliamen-tary party fully supporting democracy among the
non-socialist ‘bourgeois’ parties was the German
Democratic Party, whose support significantly
dwindled during the 1920s. Though the Social
Democratic leaders recognised that they had mostto lose from the destruction of the democraticrepublic, their own short-sighted political attitude
contributed to the spectacle of government insta-
bility, which lowered the esteem of parliamentary
government in the eyes of the German peoplewhen that esteem was already being constantlyassailed by the anti-democratic movements.The difﬁculties under which the Weimar govern-ments laboured during its early years were veryevident. It is therefore all the more remark-able how much was, nevertheless, constructively
achieved. The constituent assembly met in
February 1919 in Germany’s capital of culture,
the little town of Weimar, where Germany’s two
greatest dramatists, Goethe and Schiller, hadlived. Berlin was politically too unsettled and dan-gerous for lengthy parliamentary deliberations.
The majority of the National Assembly belonged
to the Social Democratic Party, the Centre Party
and the successors of the old Liberal Party.The constitution-making was completed byAugust 1919. In the spirit of ‘1848’, the inalien-
able rights of the individual to basic freedoms –
free speech, equality before the law, freedom of
religion – were set out; so were political rights of
free speech and assembly, but the latter could beset aside, for the president was given emergencypowers to restore public order if it were seriously
disturbed or threatened. The legislators were still
living under the shadow of the danger of com-
munist coups and the ability of the president toact quickly and decisively seemed essential. Onlylater did it turn out that the considerable powers
granted to the president would pave the way for
the destruction of the democratic republic. Thepresident himself was to be elected every sevenyears by a direct popular vote, like the presidentof the US. There was no separation of powers as
in the American constitution, yet the president’s
powers, which included that of appointing the
chancellor, meant that the Weimar constitutionalso differed from the British form of parliamen-tary government. The chancellor had to win the
majority support of the Reichstag; if he failed, the
president could dissolve the Reichstag and call
new elections. The introduction of proportional
representation was one of the most signiﬁcant fea-tures of the constitution. It led to a multiplicityof parties and inevitable coalition governments.
The old pre-1918 states – Prussia, Bavaria and the
smaller states – retained their own governments
but with lesser powers. The constitution empha-sised the sovereignty of the people and the rightof all adult men and women to vote. There could
be no doubt that the intention of the constitu-
tion was to replace the old authoritarian state with
a ‘scientiﬁcally’ constructed democracy.The flaws of the constitution have beentouched on here and are frequently stressed. But
they were not the real reason for the failure of
political democracy in Germany. The reasons for
this failure are not to be found in the shortcom-
ings of legal documents but in the shortcomingsof the politicians of the Weimar period and in thereactions of the German people to the problems
that faced them. It is perfectly true that the army
remained profoundly anti-democratic in attitude
despite its oath of loyalty to the republic. So wasthe higher civil service on the whole. No doubtmany judges were politically biased when dealing
leniently with the many political crimes of the
right and harshly with more of the few of the left.
But they did not play an active role in seeking the
overthrow of the republic. During its brief years,Weimar also appointed and promoted to highadministrative and judicial positions sincere demo-
crats who would never have secured such appoint-
ments in imperial Germany. All discrimination on
grounds of politics or religion was ended. Giventime, these newcomers would have increased andenjoyed a growing inﬂuence in the state. The years
of Weimar were by no means all negative. Women
gained just rights and opportunities, progressive1DEMOCRACY ON TRIAL129
social and educational policies were pioneered, thearts and culture ﬂourished. These were impressiveachievements in just a few short years, but time
was too short.The army was a special case. The Social Demo-crats treated the army high command and the ofﬁcers as indispensable pillars of the republic.They shared as patriotic Germans a false venera-
tion for the gods of yesterday such as Hinden-
burg. There was little excuse for this after the
behaviour of the chief of the army, General Hans
von Seeckt, in the spring of 1920. A right-wingplot to overthrow the republic, supported by FreeCorps units near Berlin, came to fruition in March
1920. Led by a General Lüttwitz, the troops
entered Berlin and installed a Prussian bureaucrat,
Wolfgang Kapp, as chancellor. To Ebert’s aston-ishment, Seeckt refused to defend the govern-ment, declaring that the ‘Reichswehr does not
shoot on the Reichswehr’. Ebert and the govern-
ment ignominiously ﬂed from Berlin to the safety
of southern Germany. The trade unions ordered ageneral strike. In Berlin some civil servants con-tinued to function, others obeyed the govern-
ment’s call and refused to work. While there was
no military opposition to Kapp’s seizure of power,
the country was industrially paralysed, and few
people would positively cooperate, though thearmy continued to remain ‘neutral’. Nevertheless,Kapp quickly recognised that he could not govern
in such circumstances. A few days after his arrival
in Berlin, he ‘resigned’ and withdrew with his
troops. Ebert returned. The weakness of the SocialDemocrats was now shown clearly, for they nei-ther dismissed the disloyal head of the army, nor
attempted to remove from the service of the
republic those who had disobeyed the govern-
ment’s call to strike. The affair was dismissed. But
the extremists on the right did not abandon theirwar against the republic of ‘traitors’.Why did the army not back the right-winginsurrectionists like Kapp? It clearly was not for
love of the republic, or of the Social Democrats.
The republic was necessary to deal with the Allies, who were in occupation of the Rhineland.The French still enjoyed overwhelming military
strength and could occupy parts of Germany at
will, as they did in 1920, 1921 and 1923. Seecktand the army high command knew that theFrench would certainly not stand idly by if thelegal democratic German government were over-
thrown by the generals. That would be the signal
for intervention. It was therefore as unrealistic to
support a man like Kapp as it would have been tobring the kaiser back.Besides attempted coups and violence from leftand right, every German was affected by the
unprecedented experience of hyperinﬂation. The
murder in June 1922 by a young nationalist of
the ‘Jew’ Foreign Minister Walter Rathenauundermined internal and foreign conﬁdence inthe political stability of Weimar Germany with
inevitably disastrous consequences for Germany’s
financial standing as well. The final blow to
German ﬁnancial stability was delivered by theGermans themselves.It was due not to reparations payments madeby Germany but to the decision of the govern-
ment to organise passive resistance when the
French, in response partly to the threatened polit-ical disintegration of Weimar Germany and eva-sion of reparations, occupied the Ruhr in January
1923. The consequent industrial standstill in the
Ruhr and the relief paid by the government to the
Germans who had no income now could be met
only by printing more money since the govern-ment was reluctant to increase taxation sufﬁcientlyto meet the bill. By the autumn of 1923 paper
money was practically worthless. A tram ticket
cost millions of marks. All goods, including food,
became scarce. No one wanted paper money thatmight lose half its value in a day. Somehow peoplesurvived with ingenuity. The pensioner and the
weakest members of society suffered the most.
Unemployment soared. Only those who had
property and understood how to manipulate
credit became rich. Industrialists like HugoStinnes amassed factories and mines paid for inworthless currency. The inﬂation left an indelible
impression.The middle classes saw their modest accumu-lation of wealth, saved from the war years, beinglost. The long-term consequences of the war werenow really felt. And more and more people were
saying that it was all the fault of the republic, both
the lost war and the lost money. The general130THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
misery provided fertile soil for extremists. In theautumn of 1923 the attitude and questionableloyalty of the chief of the army, Seeckt, was
perhaps the most disturbing feature of the situa-
tion. The communists believed Germany to be
ripe for revolution and attempted to start it inSaxony and Thuringia. Separatism was still apotent force in Bavaria and a new name, Adolf
Hitler, came to national attention when he
attempted and failed to seize power in Munich.
But in this hour of crisis for democracy and the
republic, Gustav Stresemann, a political leader of the more moderate right, an ex-monarchist, an ex-supporter of the war of 1914 and of
Germany’s plans to achieve continental European
hegemony, was entrusted with guiding Weimar’s
foreign relations.Stresemann led the small People’s Party. TheSocial Democrats agreed to his appointment 
as chancellor in August 1923 and joined the
parties of the centre and moderate right in brief-ly forming a grand government coalition. InNovember, he became foreign minister in a new
government and remained in this post through
every successive government until his death.
Historical controversy surrounds the evaluation of
Stresemann’s role in the Weimar Republic. Washe a blatant nationalist, even still an expansionist?There can be no doubt that he did wish to free
Germany from the remaining restrictions of the
Versailles Treaty: reparations, foreign occupation
and military limitations. He followed paciﬁc poli-cies openly, yet was ready secretly and deceitfully,by any practical means, to reach his goals in
making Germany respected and powerful. His
aims included the restoration of German territory
lost to Poland in the east, and the former colonies
too. But it is mistaken to see in Stresemann a pre-
cursor of Hitler. He was at heart a conservativeand an old-fashioned nationalist. He learnt from
the war experience that Germany could not
‘conquer’ Europe. To attempt this would create
another coalition against it. He was realistic andaccepted limits to German power. His powerfuland respected Germany would be one of Europe’s
great powers, not the onlygreat power. He recov-ered his country’s position and prestige duringthe course of the next six years until his untimelydeath in October 1929.Stresemann had the courage to do the polit-ically unpopular. Despite the nationalist patriotic
clamour against the French and the DiktatofVersailles, he recognised that Germany was onlyruining its economic recovery at home and itsreputation abroad. His policy was that of sweet
reasonableness, a policy of ‘fulfilment’, as it
became known. Germany would now freely
accept the Versailles Treaty, seek peace and
friendship with France and renounce any futureclaim to recover Alsace-Lorraine. The Frenchshould feel secure and so, to prove their own
acceptance of the entirely new spirit of reconcili-
ation, would show their conﬁdence by giving up
the remaining guarantees of its security – theoccupation of the Rhineland and the Allied com-mission supervising German disarmament. He
called off passive resistance and allowed the
French president, Poincaré, the illusion of victory
and German submission. The French were not sonaive as to accept all these protestations of loveat their face value but the British were delighted
at this promising turn of events. They wanted the
war to be over and peace and goodwill instantly
to reign. British foreign secretaries were more sus-
picious of the French than of the Germans,though one of them at least, Austen Chamberlain,recognised clearly enough that French militancy
was the result of their feeling of insecurity. Yet,
he too grasped at the opportunity of avoiding
closer commitments to France. Instead he under-wrote a general Western European security treatysuggested by Stresemann to head off any possi-
bility of an Anglo-French alliance and drafted
with the help of the British ambassador in Berlin.
The outcome was the Locarno Treaties of 16
October 1925. France and Germany undertookto respect each other’s territories and frontiersand to accept them as ﬁnal. This treaty of mutual
guarantee, which included Belgium, was also
signed by Britain and Italy. Britain and Italy guar-
anteed that they would come to the immediateaid of any country attacked by the other signato-ries of Locarno. But Stresemann had refused to
extend Locarno to cover Germany’s eastern fron-
tiers with Czechoslovakia and Poland, nor would1DEMOCRACY ON TRIAL131
Britain guarantee the post-Versailles frontiers inthe east as it had done in the west. AlthoughGermany also signed arbitration treaties at the
same time with Poland and Czechoslovakia, they
did not form part of the Locarno security system.
Stresemann’s hardly realistic long-term aim was torevise the eastern frontier peacefully making useof Germany’s economic preponderance.In return for renouncing territorial changesStresemann won concessions from the Allies.
Reparations were scaled down in 1924 and 1929.
Stresemann aimed to get rid of them altogether.Germany was admitted to the League of Nationsin 1926 and given a permanent seat on the
Council. Stresemann joined on condition that
Germany, too, need never ﬁght to back up the
League if it chose not to do so. The Allied com-mission supervising German disarmament waswithdrawn. Stresemann never lived to see the ful-
ﬁlment of one of his most cherished objectives –
the complete Allied evacuation of all German ter-
ritory – but before his death he had securedagreement that the Rhineland would be evacu-ated in 1930. With his French opposite number,
Aristide Briand, Stresemann gave publicity to the
new Franco-German friendship, the essence ofthe so-called ‘spirit of Locarno’, even though inprivate Stresemann was continually demandingmore concessions than France would grant. As for
Briand, he believed the French had no alternative
but to make the best of German protestations and
promises.At home, too, the years from 1924 to 1927were a brief golden period for the republic. The
currency was stabilised. The promise of peace at
home and abroad enabled the hardworking
Germans to attract large American loans which
covered the cost of reparations. American efﬁ-ciency and methods of manufacture were success-fully adopted by German industry. Business
concerns combined and formed themselves into
huge cartels in steel, chemicals and the electrical
goods industries. Export ﬂourished. Trade unions,too, enjoyed freedom and for the ﬁrst time thepositive protection of the state. These were the
brief years of prosperity and had they continued
the German people might well have come to value
more their new republican democracy. Instead, asthe economic crisis, which began among the farm-ers and spread to industry, hit Germany, a major-
ity of the electorate in the early 1930s turned to
parties that sought totalitarian solutions.132THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
The democracies of the West were tested in theperiod after the war. If they failed to retain the
active support of the people, then others were
ready to take over power. To the right, fascistmovements and later the Nazi movement devel-oped, promising new solutions. To the left, the
communists pointed to the Soviet Union and the
new society being created there as the right goal
for all progressive peoples.Before the Great War the triumph of liberaldemocracy had seemed certain in the West. EvenRussia had begun to establish embryonic parlia-
mentary institutions, and Italy had extended the
vote to all adult males. The war, which ended
with the victory of the democracies, might havebeen expected to conﬁrm the superiority of theparliamentary form of government. The tide ﬁrst
turned against democracy in Russia after the rev-
olution of 1917, in Italy in the 1920s with
Mussolini and the emergence of the fascists.
Forms of fascism spread to a number of the newBalkan successor states of the Habsburg Empire.Czechoslovakia was the shining exception, a
bastion of Western liberal ideas and institutions in
Eastern and central Europe. The most critical
question was whether Germany would become aliberal democracy.The immediate danger from the Bolsheviksfaded. The Polish defeat of the Red Army in 1920
halted any dream of spreading revolution with the
Red Army in the vanguard. Lenin and Stalin didnot lose their sense of isolation and insecurity. Onthe contrary, they expected the capitalist West toturn on communist Russia and crush it. In foreign
relations the initiative nevertheless passed out of
the hands of the Kremlin. Soviet policy in the1920s was directed to increasing the difﬁculties of‘imperialist’ Britain by encouraging the colonial
peoples, especially in Asia, to struggle for inde-
pendence. Another objective was to divide the
Western democratic nations from each other;
separate agreements of technical and militarycooperation were concluded with the governmentof Weimar Germany (Treaty of Rapallo, 1922;
Berlin, 1926). Even while cooperating, however,
the third prong of Soviet policy, surreptitiously
masterminded by the Comintern, was to promoteinternal disruption within the Western democ-
racies with the objective of weakening them and
so making it a safer world for the ﬁrst and only
communist state – Russia. In Weimar politics the
German Communist Party exerted a harmful
inﬂuence on the attempts to construct a parlia-mentary democracy. Thus, although the SovietUnion lacked the strength to endanger peace in
Europe directly, communist tactics in the demo-cratic states and fear of communism were among
the formative inﬂuences of the 1920s.The communists were weakest in the countrywhich they had mistakenly believed would lead
the ‘capitalist assault’ on the Soviet Union one
day. There was never any danger between the twoworld wars that Britain would deviate from its1Chapter 13BRITAIN, FRANCE AND THE US FROM
WAR TO PEACE
evolutionary democratic path. The tradition ofparliament, the impartial administration of thelaw and civic freedoms of the individual were too
deeply embedded in the British way of life to be
overthrown by any authoritarian movement. But,
within the constitutional framework the strugglefor ‘social justice’ increased. Working peopledemanded the satisfaction of basic economic
rights; they called for state intervention to assure
them of these rights should this prove necessary;
they wanted work, a decent wage and adequate
support for themselves and their families whenout of work or unable to work due to sickness;they expected the ending of bad housing and, as
they became increasingly aware of their disadvan-
taged position in society, a better future for their
children. Industry, the manufacturers and themine owners all looked back to before the warand wanted to be rid of all wartime government
control and direction, though not subsidies when
forthcoming.The majority of the Conservatives believed inmarket forces to remedy the economic difﬁcul-ties, in sound money and in a balanced budget.
Government’s business in the direct control of
industry, they believed, was to divest itself as
rapidly as possible of such controls as had been
brought in during the war. The Labour Party hadscarcely begun in the 1920s to translate socialistaspirations into practical policies. That work was
not done until the 1940s. Meanwhile the Labour
Party knew clearly what it did not want: commu-
nism on the Russian model. The small BritishCommunist Party was refused afﬁliation to theLabour Party and in the mid-1920s communists
could no longer be individual members of the
Labour Party. The Labour Party, supported by the
Trades Union Congress, sought power within the
constitution knowing that to be tainted with com-munism would drive away moderate political sup-port. It became the main opposition party, and
held ofﬁce on its own twice during this period,
brieﬂy in 1924 as a minority government and from
1929 until the ﬁnancial debacle of 1931.Labour prospered on the decay of the oncegreat Liberal Party. The Liberal Party had lost its
identity, its reforming policies absorbed by the
Conservatives to the right, with Labour to the leftoffering a dynamic alternative to Conservativerule. The working man’s vote in the industrialtowns swung to Labour; many Liberal supporters
deserted liberalism for the Conservatives, giving
the latter an almost unbroken hold of power in the
inter-war years. The Liberals in the post-war yearshad neither great national causes nor politicalleaders who could command a mass personal fol-
lowing as Gladstone had once done. Lloyd
George appeared the obvious candidate, the man
through whose energy and leadership Britain’s
war effort had been galvanised to victory; LloydGeorge had then become a leader on the worldstage at the Paris Peace Conference. His standing
in 1919 was, indeed, high. As prime minister of a
coalition government of those Liberals who fol-
lowed him and the Conservatives, the elections ofDecember 1918 gave the Conservative–LloydGeorgian Liberal coalition parties a landslide vic-
tory. The Liberals under Asquith, who opposed
them, won no more than twenty-eight seats.
Labour, with 2.3 million votes and sixty-threeseats, for the ﬁrst time became the main opposi-tion party. This election marked a profound
change in British politics. The results, moreover,
reﬂected a greatly enlarged electorate. For the ﬁrst
time the vote was exercised by women over thirty;
having proven during the war that they could doa man’s job on the land and in factories, womencould no longer be denied the vote.For a time Lloyd George’s personal ascen-
dancy obscured the collapse of Liberal support in
the country. He had agreed with his coalitionpartner, Andrew Bonar Law, the leader of theConservatives, that the Conservatives would
support 159 Liberal candidates, and the majority,
133, were elected as a result. Nevertheless, the
Conservatives predominated over Lloyd Georgian
Liberals in the coalition by almost three to one.This meant Lloyd George was at the mercy ofConservative support. They would drop him for
a Conservative leader when he ceased to be an
electoral asset. And that is what they did in 1922.An immediate problem facing post-war Britainwas Ireland. ‘Home rule’ was no longer enoughfor the Irish nationalists, whose cause had been
spectacularly enhanced by the Easter rising in
Dublin in 1916. Sinn Féin fought the general134THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
election of December 1918, won all but four seatsoutside Ulster, and met in Dublin – thosemembers not in prison – in a self-constituted Irish
parliament which promptly declared the whole of
Ireland an independent republic. Bloodshed,
guerrilla war and the breakdown of law and orderfollowed. The ‘Troubles’ began in 1919. Alliedwith Sinn Féin was the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) which attacked the armed police (Royal
Irish Constabulary) and the British volunteer
troops known as the Black and Tans. The IRA
attempted to force the British government inLondon to recognise Irish independence. It wasthe worst sort of violent conflict – civil war,
without battle lines, carried on by ambush, assas-
sination and murder on both sides.Two problems stood in the way of a solution:Lloyd George’s refusal to grant total independ-
ence without any link with Britain, and the atti-
tude of the six counties of Ulster, where a
majority of Protestants ﬁercely defended union,refusing to be merged with the predominantlyCatholic south. An attempted British solution 
of December 1920 did not satisfy the south.
Atrocities on both sides multiplied. But an appeal
by the king in June 1921 led to a truce and a
negotiated settlement that December. The IrishFree State became a Dominion and so remainedwithin the British Empire, and the six counties of
Ulster were granted the right to vote themselves
out of independent Ireland and so remain a part
of the United Kingdom. But the Irish leaders inLondon, in accepting partition, brought about anew civil war in Ireland in 1922 with those who
rejected the treaty. Not until the spring of 1923
was Ireland at peace, with partition a fact. Yet the
seeds of conﬂict tragically remained.Dominion status in practice meant independ-ence. The other British Dominions were inde-pendent, though the personal links between
Dominion leaders and the British political leaders
remained close and every Dominion except the
Irish Free State independently joined Britain indeclaring war on Germany in September 1939. Assigniﬁcant as this insistence of the right of the
‘white Dominions’ to exercise independence was
Britain’s declared intention to extend Dominionstatus to the ‘brown empire’. During the war, in1917, the British government had declared thatits aim was ‘responsible government’ for India.
Fourteen years later, in 1931, a viceroy of India
had advanced this to ‘Dominion status’ for India
eventually. No one in Britain believed this wouldcome about for a generation or two. But themajor Indian independence party, the Congress
Party, agitated for independence to be conceded
quickly.During the 1930s Mahatma (‘great-souled’)Gandhi had launched his remarkable movementof non-violent passive resistance to the British–Indian authorities. He served notice to the Raj
that India could not be ruled in the long run
without the consent of the Indian masses. And
these masses of the poor of India were respond-ing to a Western-educated lawyer, now turnedinto a holy man and skilled politician all in one,
walking the length and breadth of India wearing
a loincloth and carrying a stick. The emaciated
ﬁgure of Gandhi was as powerful a symbol forchange as the strutting militaristic dictators ofEurope. His teaching of how the poor and pow-
erless could force the hand of the powerful 
and armed proved to be one of the most potent
inﬂuences in the world of the twentieth century.Violence in Ireland and mass protest move-ments in India did not complete Britain’s difﬁ-culties. Nearer home British governments from
1920 down to the present day became preoccu-
pied with Britain’s relative industrial decline, the
threat of falling living standards and, most of all,the miseries of unemployment. Britain was not ahappy land between the wars. The problem was
deep-seated and arose from a combination of
changes. Britain had increasingly derived earnings
from trading as well as manufacture to offset the
cost of importing food and raw materials. After ashort post-war boom world trade contracted, par-ticularly in the 1930s, and the earnings from
carrying the world’s trade fell correspondingly.
There was no demand for more ships, and the
shipyards of Scotland and north-east Englandbecame symbols of the deepest depression andunemployment.World patterns of trade were also changing.Britain’s traditional trade in textiles and other1BRITAIN, FRANCE AND THE US FROM WAR TO PEACE135
goods to the empire suffered as the poor of theworld became even poorer. As raw material pricesfell with slackening industrial activity so the
poorest parts of the world earned less and less;
this in turn gave them less to spend on British
goods. Then textile factories, the ﬁrst stage ofindustrialisation, were springing up in India andJapan and with their low labour costs drove
Britain out of many traditional markets. Actually
Britain was remarkably successful in developing
the industries of the second industrial revolution,
the chemical, electrical and motor industries. Butthese successes could not take up the slack ofBritain’s pre-war traditional exports.The coal industry was one of the worst affect-ed. The mines were not efﬁcient, and demand for
coal slackened with declining industrial activity inEurope and the competition of oil. The powerfulminers’ union saw nationalisation as the solution
that would enable the numerous privately owned
mines to be developed on a national basis. The
mine owners, faced with declining proﬁts, arguedfor increasing hours and cutting wages. But theowners’ case was weakened by the fact that they
had not used their large proﬁts of the war years
to modernise the mines. The mines had then been
under state control and the miners were embit-
tered when Lloyd George returned them to theirowners’ control in 1921. A miners’ strike failedto win better terms. In 1925 a strike was narrowly
averted when the government paid a temporary
subsidy to the mines to prevent wage cuts, and
set up an inquiry. The report of this inquiry (theSamuel Commission) the following year foundmuch in favour of the miners’ view but rejected
nationalisation and suggested that less drastic cuts
in wages were probably inevitable. The miners
were anxious to avoid a strike which would bring
hardship to themselves, but in negotiating withthe owners refused to countenance any furthercut in wages or increase in hours. At the end of
April 1926 the government subsidy came to an
end and the mine owners now locked out the
miners.The importance of the dispute with the minerslay in the fact that it led to the General Strike of
1926, the most widespread and dramatic break-
down of Britain’s industrial relations for acentury. It lasted only nine days from 3 to 12 May1926. But these days manifested Britain’s divisioninto the labouring class and the middle and upper
classes, who for the main part wished to break the
strike. There was more involved than a strike 
of miners. The Trades Union Congress (TUC)involved itself and in doing so involved organisedlabour on the one hand, and the prime minister
Stanley Baldwin and the British government on
the other. Its sincere intention was to facilitate a
compromise settlement between the mine owners
and the miners. When these efforts foundered theTUC used its industrial muscle to call out onstrike key industries, including transport. The
government countered by putting into practice
carefully worked-out emergency measures to keep
the essential services going. The TUC’s attemptto force the government to coerce the mineowners failed, though the rank and file over-

whelmingly supported the call to strike. What was
the strike really about then? It certainly was not
an attempt to bring about a revolution. It was notpurely industrial either. At the end of the GeneralStrike, which the TUC called off, the miners were
left to ﬁght their own battle, which lasted several
bitter months.In the 1920s and 1930s Conservative-dominated governments of the Lloyd George,Baldwin and Chamberlain era were socially con-scious and anxious to pass measures that would
protect the sick and unemployed and help the
poor. Their ﬁnance was orthodox, believing the
country was best served by sound money and bal-anced budgets but not by direct control of indus-try. The minority Labour government of 1924
was just as orthodox in ﬁnancial questions as the
Conservatives. Neither Conservatives nor Labour
followed policies of confrontation and even the
General Strike was not a confrontation that eitherside had been keen to invite. What would be heldagainst the governments of the inter-war years
was the persistence of 1 million unemployed, and
much higher numbers during the most severe
years of depression, concentrated above all in thenorth of the country. No government knew howto ‘cure’ this unemployment in the prevailing
international conditions. It was the biggest argu-
ment against ‘democracy’, yet the great majority136THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
of the British electorate turned neither to fascismnor to communism.France emerged the victor from the Great War,but no country, excepting Russia, had suffered
more physical damage, human and material. Inthe struggle for power on the European conti-nent, France was the loser. Population losses had
been such that there were now three German for
every two French. French industry had been dev-
astated in northern France. The war had deeply
scarred the towns and countryside of this region,whereas no battles, apart from the early encoun-ters in East Prussia, had been fought on German
soil. One in every five Frenchmen had been
mobilised during the war (one in eight in Britain),
1.4 million killed and another three-quarters of amillion permanently invalided. Put another way,it has been calculated that for every ten men
between the ages of twenty and forty-ﬁve, two
were killed, one was totally invalided and three
were incapacitated for long periods of time,leaving only four available for work. The Frenchgovernments faced the common problems of
demobilisation and changeover from wartime and
industrial controls to a peacetime economy. In
addition the French had to cope with the task of
reconstruction in the war-torn regions of France.The acquisition of Alsace-Lorraine and theutilisation of the Saar mines were important com-
pensations for the losses suffered, but did not
cancel them out. Financially France was in a dif-
ﬁcult plight. The government had ﬁnanced thewar not by taxes but largely by making loans athome and receiving loans from Britain and the
US. After the war, yet more money had to be
found for reconstruction and invalid or widows’
pensions. France was dependent on the goodwill
of the US and Britain. It was also dependent onreceiving reparations from Germany to cover thegap between what it could earn and what it spent.
French needs and policies in the 1920s have 
not received the understanding and sympathy
they deserve. In British judgement, the Frenchwere acting vindictively and arrogantly towardsdefeated Germany, and thus were responsible in
part for Germany’s fervent nationalism and for
delaying a ‘normalisation’ and pacification ofWestern Europe. Britain came to see its role notas an ally of France so much as a mediatorbetween France and ‘helpless’ Germany in the
interests of creating a new balance of power. This
British attitude of ‘conditional’ support could
only strengthen France’s anxieties about its long-term security once Germany had revived itsstrength.For France the ‘German problem’ was insolu-ble, because France alone could not enforce any
solution in the long run. Britain and the US could
express their disapproval effectively by applyingﬁnancial pressure on a weakened French economy.But the exaction of reparations from Germany
was, for France, not only a necessary ﬁnancial
operation; far more was involved. Nothing less
than the question of whether Germany would berequired, and if necessary forced, by the Allies toabide by all the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.
On that issue depended the security of France. 
If Germany could set aside reparations with
impunity, then why not also the military restric-tions and ﬁnally the territorial clauses of Versailles?Marshal Foch had expressed these deep fears when
he called the Treaty of Versailles no more than a
twenty-year truce. France had already lost one pil-
lar of its security when the Senate of the US failed
to ratify the Treaty of Guarantee, and Britain, too,according to its original terms, had backed out.The second pillar of its security was the Allied
(including its own) right to occupy the Rhineland
zones and to continue to do so beyond the ﬁve-,
ten- and ﬁfteen-year periods speciﬁed if Germanydid not fulfil its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles. After the failure of the Treaty of
Guarantee, the French were naturally all the 
more determined to maintain their rights. In the
third pillar, the League of Nations, the French
realistically did not place much faith.In March 1921, with the Germans appearingto be evading the military and ﬁnancial obliga-
tions placed on them, the French, with Britain’s
blessing and cooperation, occupied three indus-
trial German towns. Almost immediately after-wards the Germans were presented with the totalreparations bill of 132 billion gold marks (£6,600
million) and a method of payment. The Germans
gave way. Reparations were regularly resumed1BRITAIN, FRANCE AND THE US FROM WAR TO PEACE137
until the end of 1922. Then the Germansdefaulted once again and disputed with Poincaré,by then prime minister, the amounts due and
already delivered. Despite British disapproval,
French and Belgian troops occupied the industrial
Ruhr in January 1923, ostensibly with the objectof collecting what was due. The more importantobjective was to weaken Germany’s reviving
power by occupying its most important industrial
region. French uncertainties about Germany’s
ultimate intentions had been increased by the
murder of Rathenau, by the political instability ofthe country and by what appeared to be deliber-ate attempts to evade its obligations.The French move was no sudden reaction butthe result of a carefully thought-out policy. It
separated France from Britain, as the Germanscould not fail to note, and they exploited the splitsuccessfully in the 1920s. The German govern-
ment called an industrial boycott in the Ruhr,
thereby providing the French with a reason for
staying there; only the German coal ownersrefused to behave so patriotically and continueddelivering coal to the French. The ruin of German
finances, which was the consequence of Ger-

many’s decision to order industrial passive resis-
tance in the Ruhr, was a victory of sorts for
Poincaré. In outward appearance his resistance toBritish mediating pressure seemed justiﬁed too.He demanded that the Germans call off their
industrial boycott before fresh negotiations over
reparations could be started to resolve the under-
lying problem that had led to the occupation. InSeptember 1923 the new Stresemann govern-
ment abandoned resistance and agreed to resume
reparations payments.All along, however, reparations had been onlypart of the reason for the conﬂict. The French felt
too weak to control the Germans single-handed.The years 1923–4 marked France’s last effort toattain what it had failed to secure at Versailles, a
means of checking the future threat of German
preponderance in Europe. France failed in 1924
and had to bow to the pressure of the US andBritain. This was marked by its agreement thatexperts should work out a new reparations settle-
ment which, when accepted by Germany, would
leave France no excuse to stay in the Ruhr. TheAmerican expert Charles G. Dawes gave his nameto the reparations plan of 1924; it did not ﬁx afinal total but, as expected, scaled down the
immediate annual payments and coupled payment
to a loan to the Germans. The Germans accepted
the plan and with the restoration of the value oftheir currency became internationally credit-
worthy. Poincaré fell from power. Briand, who
returned to power, had no option but to end 
the occupation. Meanwhile, all the efforts that the
French had made to encourage separation in the
Rhineland failed.The French had to make the best of the situ-ation. The outcome was the European reconcili-
ation of Locarno. Briand and Stresemann to all
outward appearances had buried wartime en-
mities. In the Locarno Treaties, signed on 16October 1925, the Germans renounced anydesire to change their western frontier with
France and so accepted the loss of Alsace-
Lorraine. Britain and Italy guaranteed the 
western frontiers and the continued demilitarisa-tion of Rhineland against a ‘ﬂagrant breach’, andengaged themselves to aid the victim of aggres-
sion whether France or Germany. The British
congratulated themselves that their original
Versailles obligations were now lessened, since
‘ﬂagrant’ was an adjective open to different inter-pretation. The French sadly noted that they hadsecured British support not in an equal Anglo-
French alliance but with Britain in its new role 
as mediator and arbitrator. Much would there-
fore depend on the view Britain took of any particular situation.France was left with no secure allies. Its posi-tion was worse than in 1914 when Russia, mili-
tarily, had been a powerful and reliable ally. It had
a new alliance with Poland and Czechoslovakia,
but these two countries could not be relied on toﬁght for French security, nor France for theirs, for there was a ‘catch’ in the European security
arrangements. The Germans had refused to
include their eastern frontier with Czechoslovakia
and Poland in the Locarno Treaties package.Britain and Italy did not act as guarantors of these frontiers, either. The Germans had signed
arbitration treaties with Czechoslovakia and
Poland separately, but they were worth little. The138THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
Germans could still resort to force if arbitrationdid not give them what they wanted. Only theseparate alliances of Poland and Czechoslovakia
with France might deter Germany. But now, by
the terms of the Locarno Treaties, France would
be arraigned as the aggressor if the French armysought to come to the aid of their eastern alliesby the only means available to them – an attack
on Germany. Britain was to exercise this ‘lever-
age’ to the full when, thirteen years later, France
declared itself ready to aid its Czech ally against
Germany in 1938. Britain then insisted that,should such an eventuality lead to war withGermany, it was not bound to help France.In the new spirit of conciliation, France alsorelinquished prematurely its territorial guarantees
permitted by Versailles, the occupation of theRhineland zones. In order to prove their good-will, Britain and France had pulled out their last
troops by 1930. The ‘goodwill’ and ‘faith’ were
not justiﬁed, as the later experience of the 1930s
was to show. Briand played this last card of defus-ing the German problem by seeking to makeGermany and France the nucleus of a ‘new
Europe’, but in vain.Where, then, was the most serious single flaw in the way in which Britain and France, 
with American ﬁnancial connivance, dealt withGermany? Was the right policy coercion or con-ciliation? Both were tried, with some good results
and some bad. But the basic fault of Allied policy
lay in not maintaining Anglo-French unity after
the war. Allied policy of either coercion or con-ciliation should have been based on strength, onthe capacity and determination to preserve peace
if ever again threatened by Germany. The French
realised this and tried to act as if they were strong.
It was Britain that basically undermined this
stance. Horriﬁed by the Great War and the mil-lions of dead and maimed, it attempted to with-draw and limit its European commitments. At
Locarno it had refused to guarantee the frontiers
of Poland and Czechoslovakia, an open invitation
to German revisionism. Britain acknowledgedthat its strategic ‘frontier’ now ran along theRhine, but the British Cabinet was not willing to
match this concept militarily by maintaining a
British army capable of defending this supposedly‘joint’ frontier. France alone stood as guardian ofthe European frontiers of Versailles, and Franceby itself was too weak for that role. Briand’s
policy of reconciliation was sincere enough; it
seemed also the only way left to achieve French
security.Despite the grave uncertainties of France’sEuropean position, and weakness of its inter-
national ﬁnancial position, it achieved a spectacu-
lar domestic recovery in the 1920s. The majority
of Frenchmen resisted the siren call of those on
the right, the fascist Action Française, or theCommunist Party on the extreme left, whosought to overthrow the institutions of the Third
Republic.The elections of November 1919 were won by groups of the conservative right allied in a Bloc National. Led by an ex-socialist, AlexandreMillerand, its commanding ﬁgure was Clemen-

ceau, the ‘father of victory’. Behind the Bloc stood
big business interests and the mass of voters, espe-

cially the peasantry frightened by the Bolshevikbogey. They approved of a policy of dealing sternlywith Germany; exacting reparations rather than
paying taxes. Once elected, the Bloc National
reverted to the tradition of the Third Republic in
denying the presidency to Clemenceau in 1920.
They preferred a weak president, only this timeoverdid it in electing a man who a few months laterhad to retire into a mental home. Clemenceau’s
career, too, was ended.The work of reconstruction was begun innorth-eastern France and with government cred-its there was enough to do to ensure full employ-ment in the 1920s. Some concessions were also
made to the workers in legislating for an eight-
hour day and conceding collective bargaining.
But control of industry was handed back to the
owners. The government was ﬁrmly opposed tonationalisation and socialism. Among industrialworkers after the war there was much discon-
tent. Their wages had not kept pace with rising
prices. The main French trade union – the Con-
fédération Générale du Travail – was determinedto challenge the government in a series of large,well-organised strikes. The socialist-inspired
strikes were as much political as economic.
Conﬁdent of the army and of majority electoral1BRITAIN, FRANCE AND THE US FROM WAR TO PEACE139
support, the government would not yield; theunions had no chance and lost. In the 1920sFrench socialism split, as it did elsewhere in
Europe. The communists formed their own party
and separate trade union. The ‘democratic’ social-
ists, led by Léon Blum, and democratic tradeunions organised themselves also. The split of the‘left’ was mirrored by a split on the right,
Poincaré’s policies having failed to produce the
expected results in 1923.The elections of 1924 gave power to a group-ing of centre radicals and socialists, the so-calledCartel des Gauches. The Bloc National formedthe main opposition to the right, and the small
Communist Party to the left, but the presence of
the communists to their left, bitterly critical, had
the effect of inhibiting the socialists from collab-orating with the radicals of the centre. The splitof French socialism thus deprived the large social-
ist electorate from exercising an inﬂuence in the
government of the Republic commensurate with
their strength. It was a formula for sterility.Meanwhile the undoing of the Cartel governmentwas its inability to master the ﬁnancial situation.
The franc fell precipitously in value. While
American loans were reaching Germany, the
French inability and refusal to negotiate a debt
settlement with the US closed the Americanmoney market to the French. In 1926, theChamber turned once more to the strongman of
French politics, Poincaré. Poincaré was granted
special powers to restore France to financial
health, which he promptly succeeded in doing byraising taxes and cutting expenditure. France nowexperienced a few golden years of progress and
prosperity until the effects of the worldwide
slump made themselves seriously felt in France in
1933.In industrial strength and inﬂuence the US hademerged as a world power by the close of the First
World War. But victory left the American people
disillusioned with the role of world leadership
that Wilson had sought to thrust upon them. Yetduring the 1920s and 1930s there was no way inwhich the Americans could opt out of world
affairs and return to what appeared only in retro-
spect as a golden past of American self-sufﬁciency.The immediate post-war mood favoured arapid return to freeing the individual Americanfrom all constraints of wartime control and freeing
business too to get on with the job of expanding
American prosperity. An amiable conservative
Republican politician, Warren G. Harding, hadbeen elected to the White House in November1920 on a campaign slogan that reﬂected the 
public mood precisely: ‘less government in busi-
ness and more business in government’. Business-
men were no longer depicted as the ‘robber
barons’ ruthlessly amassing wealth but as the new patriotic leaders who would benefit the average American. On 4 March 1921 Harding 
was inaugurated. Big business was brought into
government with the appointment of Andrew
Mellon, one of the richest men of the US, whose wealth was exceeded only by Rockefellerand Ford, as secretary of the treasury. Mellon’s
fortune was founded on banking, channelling
money into steel, railroads and a wide range 
of industry. There were other appointments ofmen of proven ability: Herbert Hoover, HenryWallace and, as secretary of state to take charge 
of foreign affairs, a brilliant lawyer, Charles Evans
Hughes. Unfortunately, Harding made grave
errors too in rewarding political cronies of his 
own state, Ohio. The ‘Ohio gang’ were to sur-round Harding in 1923 during the last months of his administration with spectacular scandals of
corruption.The early boom which had absorbed the ex-servicemen in 1919 collapsed in 1920 and thedepression lasted until 1922. But then followedseven years of remarkable economic expansion
and rising industrial prosperity led by the growth
of the automobile industry, electrical machinery
and appliances and building. Yet, the decade was
to close with the most severe and long-lastingeconomic collapse in American history. The1920s did not turn out to be the new era of
never-ending prosperity.With hindsight the weaknesses of the 1920scan be discerned. Industry, enjoying the protec-tion of a high tariff, had over-expanded as its pro-ductivity had increased. Wages had failed to keep
pace with the increases in production. Big busi-
ness had successfully defeated the great waves of140THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
strikes that spread across the country in 1919 bycharacterising the strikers and their leaders asBolsheviks. Acts of terrorism in the cities were
blamed on the ‘radicals’ and communists. Anti-
labour hysteria swept the country. Aliens were
arrested as suspected communists though fewwere actually deported. The most celebrated caseof prosecution of suspected radicals arousing
worldwide interest was the arrest and conviction
in 1920 of two anarchists, Nicola Sacco and
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, for robbery and murder.
Liberals insisted that their trial was a travesty ofjustice and called for their release. They were exe-cuted all the same in 1927.Intolerance and hysteria extended to otherminorities: black people were vulnerable as well as
Jews and Catholics. The racial prejudice by whitesand competition for work in the cities explodedin racial riots in some twenty cities in 1919.
Before the Great War the great majority of the
black population had lived in the south. During
the war half a million African Americans soughtan escape from poverty by migrating to the indus-trial cities of the north. Wilson’s efforts to estab-
lish democracy and self-determination in Europe
stood in glaring contrast to intolerance and dis-
crimination at home. In the south the Ku Klux
Klan greatly expanded its violent activities.One of the most extraordinary aspects ofAmerican government in the era of ﬁnancial and
industrial ‘freedoms’ of the 1920s was the inva-
sion of people’s privacy and right to lead the life
they chose through the enactment of Prohibition.Congress had passed the law in 1919 overWilson’s veto. The law could never be properly
enforced as ordinary citizens constantly broke it
by surreptitiously consuming liquor. On the now
illegal manufacture and transportation of alco-
holic drinks gangster empires flourished. Themost notorious, Al Capone’s, in Chicago, with itsaura of violence and series of street murders
undertaken by rival gangs, became as much a
symbol of America in the 1920s as jazz and the
stolid respectability of President John CalvinCoolidge, who had succeeded to the presidencyin August 1923 following the death of Harding.
Related to the attitude of intolerance was the
change in immigration laws. They, too, exhibiteda racial aspect of discrimination. Immigrationfrom eastern Asia was cut off. Quotas for immi-grants were now established, which favoured the
British, Germans, Irish and Scandinavians as
against the ‘new immigrants’ from central and
southern Europe. The era of virtually free entryto the US from Europe was over. Somethingspecial which the US stood for – a haven from
persecution – was ended.American soldiers returned from Europebelieving they had won the war for the Allies, and
their president sailed home believing he had putthe world on the road to peace and prosperity.Dreams turned sour. The American people now
wanted to get on with their own lives, to own a
home, a Model-T Ford and a refrigerator. The
Hollywood dream industry started on its phenom-enal growth. In the inter-war years more and moreAmericans questioned why the US had involved
itself at all in the war. The overwhelming feeling
was that the American continent was far enough
away from the storm centres of Europe and Asia toenjoy geographical security. There was thus noreason why Americans should again sacriﬁce their
lives for other nations. They needed no large
army. Their security could be guaranteed by a
navy powerful enough to meet any challenge.International naval disarmament was wel-comed as it would allow less to be spent on theUS navy. President Harding bowed to the public
revolt on armaments expenditure. Secretary of
State Hughes was successful in hosting a naval
disarmament conference in Washington. TheBritish, too, were anxious to turn their backs on the war and reduce armaments expenditure.
The outcome of the conference was a treaty in
which Britain and the US agreed to limit their
battleship strength to 500,000 tons each and
Japan to 300,000 tons. It was said that theWashington Conference between November1921 and February 1922 sank more ships than all
the naval battles of the war put together. As there
were no American or British naval bases anywhere
close to Japan, and American and British navaldefences spanned the Atlantic and Mediterraneantoo, the apparent Japanese inferiority was not so
real. At that same conference, in further treaties,
the Americans hoped to ensure that China would1BRITAIN, FRANCE AND THE US FROM WAR TO PEACE141
remain free and independent. More important,the Japanese government itself decided to with-
draw from Siberia and China. The treaties pro-vided the illusion of peace in eastern Asia withoutsolving the underlying conﬂicts, just as the later
Locarno Treaties created the illusion of peace in
Europe. The climax came in 1928 with the
Briand–Kellogg treaty ‘outlawing’ war. They
lulled the West into a false sense of security. Nodoubt many people wished to be lulled.Americans did not speak of ‘isolationism’ in the 1920s, but of ‘America ﬁrst’. Even the Mid-

westerner knew that the US could not be separated
from the rest of the world. What Americansdemanded was that in dealings with the rest of theworld it was the duty of Congress and the admin-

istration to take care of American interests and not
to meddle in the world concerns of the League 
of Nations. Above all, America should not be
dragged into conﬂicts by concluding a military
alliance with any other country but should preservea ‘free hand’, conﬁdent in its ability to defend its

interests. It was an attitude based on conﬁdence.
In fact, the American administrations involvedthe US more in problems of international diplo-macy than the American people would haveapproved of.One aspect of ‘America ﬁrst’ was the insistenceon collecting all the moneys lent mainly to Franceand Britain but also to the other Allies, duringthe Great War. Since Europe remained in des-
perate need of American loans, the administrationcould pressurise the wartime Allies by closing theAmerican money market to those nations which
defaulted. One of the curious results of this
outlook was the treatment of Germany. When the
US, at length, concluded a separate peace with its
former enemy, only token reparations weredemanded. Consequently, Germany had freeaccess to the American money market. American
ﬁnancial orthodoxy in the 1920s had the effect of
dragging out the reparations problem which did
so much to unsettle Europe.Americans did play a major role in 1924 and1930 and gave a lead in sorting out the repara-
tion question, but rejected the British suggestion
that German reparations should be linked to
Allied indebtedness. It would have created a very
much healthier international ﬁnancial climate ifboth large reparations and large debts had beencancelled altogether. Lessons were learnt only
after the Second World War. A narrow, national-
istic approach to international ﬁnance and trade,
in the end, harmed the US as much as it did othercountries, for it contributed to the great collapseof 1929 and to the depression of the 1930s 
and so, indirectly, to the rise of Hitler and the
outbreak of the Second World War.142THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY

The world of the twentieth century differedsharply from that of the nineteenth. The twentieth
century was the age of the masses. Those who
governed had the opportunity for the ﬁrst time tocommunicate directly with those they governed.The mass-circulation newspapers, the radio, the
cinema and, after the Second World War, televi-
sion, created entirely new conditions of govern-
ment. Contemporaries were not slow to recognise
this. Those who ruled could create images ofthemselves, of their policies and objectives, of society and the world around them and so seek
to lead and manipulate the masses. Mass persua-
sion became an essential ingredient of govern-
ment; and the techniques of the art were seriouslystudied and consciously applied by elected gov-ernments and totalitarian regimes alike; the British
prime minister Stanley Baldwin used the radio
effectively during the General Strike of 1926 by
broadcasting to the nation; President Roosevelt
started his famous ‘ﬁreside chats’; and the totali-tarian leaders, Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler, put ongigantic displays that could be ‘witnessed’ by mil-
lions through the cinema. Mussolini’s and Hitler’s
raucous speeches became familiar to every Italian
and German; they were ampliﬁed by loudspeakerserected in public places in case anyone turned offtheir radio at home. Manipulation, today’s ‘spin’,
became the art of politics.The privileged felt alarmed and threatened bythis new age that was dawning. In countries withstrong traditions of representative government anddemocratically inspired institutions this new forceof the ‘masses’ was successfully integrated. This is
essentially what happened in Britain and the US in
the 1920s and 1930s and, less convincingly, inFrance too. In the Soviet Union the mass of peoplewere brought into harmony with the rulers by pro-

paganda, appeals to communist idealism and,
where this did not sufﬁce, by force and terror. The

revolution created a new class of privileged and
bound these to the regime. But those who hadpossessed social, political and economic privilege inpre-war Russia lost it. The spectre of revolution
haunted the majority of Western societies where
communist parties only gained the allegiance of a
determined minority. The danger from theextreme left was generally exaggerated. The weak-
nesses of existing representative forms of govern-

ment to deal with national problems, became
glaringly clear to everyone. The soldiers returning
from the hardships of a long war to the unsettled
conditions of post-war Europe, with its endemicunder-employment as economies readjusted fromwar to peace, were disillusioned.The victors did not experience the rewards ofvictory. Neither territorial increases nor repara-
tions could compensate for the immense humanloss and material damage of the war. The defeatedin any case lacked the means to compensate the
victors adequately. Among the defeated powers
the sense of loss now suffered made the sacriﬁces
of war seem all the more unbearable. Unrequitednationalism was a powerful destabilising force in1Chapter 14ITALY AND THE RISE OF FASCISM
post-war Europe. It differed from the pre-1914variety in that it was not just expansionist; it alsowas fed by the fury felt at the injustices real and
imagined.Among the victorious nations the Italians par-ticularly suffered from this malaise. They referredto the ‘mutilated’ peace that had not given themwhat they believed they deserved. The Ottoman
Empire had been defeated by the Allies, but the
Greeks, British and French were the intended
principal beneﬁciaries. The sorest point of all was
that Italy, despite its sacriﬁces in the war, had notreplaced the Habsburgs as the paramount Balkanpower. At the peace conference the ﬂashpoint of
Italian resentment came when Italian claims to
the Italian-speaking port of Fiume, formerly in
the Habsburg Empire, were rejected by its allies.Gabriele D’Annunzio, poet and professionalpatriot, thereupon took the law into his own
hands and with government connivance and indi-
cations of royal support in 1919 seized Fiume at
the head of an army of volunteers. The outburstof super-patriotism, bravado and violence, thedictatorial rabble-rousing techniques of balcony-
oratory that D’Annunzio adopted made him the
duce on whom Mussolini modelled his own polit-
ical style.Whenever representative institutions had noestablished hold there was a tendency towardsauthoritarian forms of government that promised
to meet the multiplicity of problems. The partic-
ular movement which became known to the
world as fascism ﬁrst reached power in post-warItaly. It developed in response to problems andopportunities facing the West in the twentieth
century and arose out of the Great War. But its
success, at the same time, has to be studied in
purely Italian terms. The form that fascism later
took varied so much from one country to anotheras the movement spread in the 1930s to Austria,Hungary, Romania, France, Portugal and Spain
that historians dispute the usefulness of applying
a common label.What can it be said to have had in commonbefore the Second World War? Fascism was amovement designed to secure the support of the
masses for a leader without the intermediary of a
democratically elected parliament. It was a substi-tute for democracy, giving the masses the illusionof power without the reality. Thus, though vio-lently anti-communist, fascism appeared to sup-
port the existing social and economic hierarchy of
society and so appealed to the right. Fascism made
a virtue of destroying the powers of parties anddivisions in the state. It stood for ‘strengththrough unity’ at the expense of civil liberties. The
cult of the leader was fostered, above all, by the
leader and his principal lieutenants. Fascism was a
chauvinist male-oriented movement assigning
women to the role of child-bearing and raising afamily. It was stridently nationalist. The leader,with virtually unlimited powers, stood at the apex
of a party, a private army and a bureaucracy.
Violence against opponents cowed possible oppo-
sition. The fascist army and bureaucracy, ofcourse, ensured that tens of thousands would havea vested interest in preserving the fascist state.
Here loyalty to the movement, not social stand-
ing, provided an avenue of advancement to the
unscrupulous and the ambitious.In Italy, as elsewhere, fascism derived itsstrength as much from what it was against as from
what it was for. In detail this varied according to
the tactical need of the movement to attain and
then retain power. It was a totalitarian response
to new social forces and to change and to dis-contents real and imagined, both personal andnational. Parliamentary government had func-

tioned very imperfectly already before the war.
The conduct of the war did not enhance parlia-
ment’s prestige. The disaster of the battle ofCaporetto was blamed on civilian mismanage-
ment. The mass of impoverished Italians in the
south, and the agricultural and the urban workers
in the north, half a century after uniﬁcation still
did not identify themselves with the parliamentary
state set up by Piedmont, depending as it did onlocal favours and corruption.Government was by personalities rather thanby leaders of parties. Manhood suffrage, intro-
duced in 1912, and proportional representation
in 1919, undermined the way in which parliamentand government had previously been managed.The two biggest parties, which emerged from the
elections of 1919 with more than half the seats
between them, the Catholic Popular Party (100144THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
seats) and the Socialists (156), were both inca-pable of providing the basis of a stable coalitionwith the Liberal and Nationalist parties to the left
of centre or the right of centre. The Socialists
were divided between the communists and the
more moderate socialists in 1921. Since 1919neither wing wished to collaborate with govern-ment and both spoke the language of revolution.
The Catholic Popular Party had been formed with
the tacit support of the Pope to ﬁght socialism.
But it was not a class party. The majority were
genuinely reformist, advocating the distributionof the landed estates to the peasantry. It was amass party relying on the support of the agricul-
tural labourer in the south, just as the Socialist
strength lay in the industrial towns of the north.
But the Popular Party also included conservativeand extreme-right supporters. Their support ofgovernment policies was accordingly unpre-
dictable. The ﬁve governments between 1918 and
1922 were consequently faced with parliamentary
paralysis and no sound base on which to build amajority. Giovanni Giolitti dominated the lastyears of Italian parliamentary life.Against the Catholics and Socialists, Giolittienlisted the help of Mussolini’s Fascists who, in
the elections of May 1921, with his electoral
support, gained thirty-ﬁve deputies out of morethan 500. It was a modest parliamentary begin-ning for the Fascists. But, without Giolitti,
Mussolini and his party would have remained a
negligible constitutional force. In the streets,
however, the Fascists had already made their vio-lence felt. They ﬂourished on the seed-bed ofindustrial and agricultural discontent. There was
large-scale post-war unemployment. On the land
the peasantry took possession of uncultivated
parts of the large landed estates. In the towns mil-
itant unionism demanded higher wages and insome instances in 1920 occupied factories. It wasnot the beginning of revolution.Higher wages were conceded, the standard ofliving of the urban worker rose appreciably
despite higher prices. Real wages were between aquarter and a third higher in 1922 than in 1919,and by the autumn of 1922 unrest subsided. It
was at this point that Mussolini came to power,
claiming to have saved the country from theimaginary threat of Bolshevism and offeringfascism as an alternative.Mussolini succeeded in attracting attention tohimself in his pose as statesman and duce. He
made Italy seem more important in internationalaffairs than its weak industrial resources and mil-itary strength warranted. It was an image built up
with skill to mislead a gullible world. The success
of fascism lay largely in creating such myths
which, after 1925, became identiﬁed with the
public personality Mussolini created of himself.Benito Mussolini was born to ‘proletarian’parents on 29 July 1883 in the small town of
Predappio in the poor east-central region of Italy,
the Romagna. His father was a blacksmith and
named his son Benito after the Mexican revolu-tionary leader Juarez. From youth onwards,Mussolini admired rebellious violence against the
‘establishment’ of schoolmasters; and as he
became older he rebelled against the better off
and privileged. He experienced poverty, and hishatred of privilege turned him into an ardentsocialist. He left Italy and spent some time in
Switzerland under socialist tutelage. He then
accepted both the internationalist and pacifist
outlook of the socialists. Yet in 1904 he returned
to Italy to serve his obligatory time in the armyand clearly enjoyed army life and discipline. It wasthe ﬁrst and not the only inconsistency in his
development. For a time he took a post as a
teacher. But above all Mussolini saw himself as a
socialist political agitator. He rose to prominencein the pre-war Italian Socialist Party, belonging to the most extreme revolutionary wing. He
denounced nationalism as a capitalist manifesta-
tion and was brieﬂy imprisoned for his activities
in seeking to hinder the war effort during Italy’s
Libyan war with Turkey, 1911–12. His impris-onment brought him into favour with the revo-lutionary socialists who controlled the Socialist
Party in 1912. They appointed Mussolini to the
editorship of Avanti, the socialist newspaper.Consistency and loyalty to friends and princi-ples was not a strong trait in Mussolini. War, thatis international violence, later attracted him.
Mussolini was no paciﬁst by nature. All went well
with his efforts as a socialist editor until shortly1ITALY AND THE RISE OF FASCISM145
after the outbreak of the Great War. Then, to theanger of the Socialists who condemned the capitalist war and demanded non-intervention,
Mussolini switched and started banging the drum
of nationalism and patriotism in Avanti. TheSocialists thereupon ousted him from the editor-ship. Mussolini then founded his own paper inNovember 1914, the Popolod’Italia
, and cam-paigned for intervention. Without political con-
nections his inﬂuence, however, was negligible.
He served in the army from 1915 to 1917, was
wounded and, on release from the army, returnedto patriotic journalism.Mussolini observed the impotence and weak-ness of parliamentary government after the war
and saw it as an opportunity for him to form and
lead an authoritarian movement; with its help hemight then play an important role in the state,something he had so far failed to do.A meeting in Milan, addressed by Mussolini,of some 200 of his followers in March 1919
marks the formal beginning of the Fascist move-ment. The movement in the beginning expressedits hostility to property and to capitalist industry
and followed the line of French syndicalism in
advocating worker control of industry – ‘eco-

nomic democracy’ – and so tried to win the urban
workers’ support. Yet in its early years the moneyﬂowing in to support it, and to fund Mussolini’sown newspaper, came from Milan industrialists.
The landowners too intended to use his bands of
ruffians – the squadristi– against peasants.Mussolini’s personal inclinations were probablysocialist still in 1919, but in his bid for power hewas ready to trim his sails and operate in the
interests of property to secure the support of
industrialists and landowners. He had become a
pure opportunist and adventurer.Fascism was the main beneﬁciary of the inef-fectual trade union activities, the occupation ofthe factories in the summer of 1920 and the
Socialists’ appeals to workers to engage in a
general strike. During the winter of 1920 and the
following spring, bands of Fascists in their blackshirts, both in the towns and in the countryside,attacked all forms of labour organisations, social-
ist councils, socialist newspapers, even cultural
societies. Opponents were beaten and tortured.The ‘red shirts’ offered resistance and streetbattles ensued. Liberal Italy and the Church,while condemning all violence, connived at the
destruction of socialist organisations by the
Fascists. Since the government appeared power-
less to restore law and order, the Fascists came tobe regarded as the protectors of property by themiddle classes and not as the principal disturbers
of the peace, which they were.The rapid growth of violent bands of Fascists,swelled by the followers of D’Annunzio, whose
escapade in Fiume had collapsed, could no longerbe effectively controlled by Mussolini and at thisstage, in 1921, was unwelcome to him. Mussolini
had entered parliament as the leader of a small
party and sought power in alliance with either one
of the two large parties, the Catholic PopularParty or the Socialists. He chose the Socialiststemporarily to capture the mass votes of the urban
workers. But the leaders of the Fascist bands were
outraged at this ‘betrayal’. Mussolini even lost the
leadership of the party for a short time. TheFascists continued their violence in the cities andthe countryside. Mussolini also nourished the
belief of the parliamentary Liberals that he would
cooperate with them against the socialist left.Mussolini played the anti-Bolshevik card for allhe was worth. The call by the Socialists in July1922 for a general strike in a bid to stop theincreasing lawlessness and drift to the right pro-
vided a semblance of justiﬁcation for Mussolini’s
claims. The strike call was a failure but increased
the desire for tough measures against the workers.The support the Fascists were given was particu-larly strong from those groups – artisans, white-
collar workers and shopkeepers, the lower-middle
class – who saw their status threatened and
usurped by the demands of the workers. The
army despised the parliamentary regime, whichwas obliged to reduce their swollen wartimestrength. Mussolini’s strident nationalism natu-
rally appealed to them. Prefects and civil servants
in the provinces, too, connived at Fascist violence
and were hedging their bets in case the Fascistsshould one day come to power. Giolitti’s policyof non-interference in disputes which he believed
would blow themselves out was a clever tactic as
far as weakening the strength of the trade unions146THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
and socialists was concerned. Strikes diminished.Any danger the left had posed was rapidly van-ishing. But the low government profile also
created a power vacuum which the Fascists ﬁlled
until they themselves openly deﬁed law and order
and even threatened the state itself. Without gov-ernment weakness, without the parliamentaryparalysis which prevented the liberal centre from
forming a stable coalition, the Fascists could
never have gained power. While the politi-
cians connived and jockeyed for power, divided 
as much by ambition as policy, administrationthroughout the country was becoming anarchic.The Fascists chose the month of October 1922to seize power from the unstable Liberal admin-
istrations. Their plan was ﬁrst to stage uprisings
in the provinces which would capture prefecturesand post ofﬁces and cut off Rome from the sur-rounding countryside thus paralysing govern-
ment, and then to march on Rome with armies
of ‘blackshirts’ and throw out the government by
force if intimidation did not sufﬁce. Convenientlyfor Mussolini, his one rival duce, D’Annunzio,who might have claimed the leadership, fell on his
head from a balcony after quarrelling with his
mistress. It was rumoured that the poet’s fall had
been assisted. A touch of opera was never entirely
absent from the dramatic moments of Italianhistory.Yet a Fascist victory was far from certain. It wasa great gamble, as Mussolini knew while he
waited in Milan, a Fascist stronghold not too far
from the Swiss frontier, in case of failure. Theking, Victor Emmanuel III, held the key to thesituation. Loyalty to the dynasty was strong and
it seems most probable that the army, though
inﬁltrated by Fascists from the highest-ranking
ofﬁcers to the most junior, would have responded
to his lead and command. But there was nothingheroic about Victor Emmanuel. He did not putarmy loyalty to the test. Although a constitutional
monarch, he must increasingly have lost conﬁ-
dence in the jockeying politicians and in the 
corruption of the electoral system. When his min-isters finally found the courage to resist thethreats of the Fascists, the king refused them 
his backing and, in doing so, handed Italy over
to Mussolini.The government in Rome, after receiving newsof the Fascist uprising, of the seizure of govern-ment buildings in the provinces, was at ﬁrst unde-
cided how to act. It had already resigned in the
process of another reshufﬂe but in the interim
remained in charge. After a night of alarm, LuigiFacta, the temporary prime minister, havingsecured assurances of the loyalty of the army gar-
rison in Rome, decided with the support of his
ministers on a ﬁrm stand. The army was ordered
to stop the Fascist attempt to seize Rome. Early
on the morning of 28 October 1922 an emer-gency decree was published that amounted to aproclamation of martial law. The king refused his
assent to this decree and so it was revoked. The
way was now open to Mussolini to state his terms.
He demanded that he be asked to head the newgovernment. The king’s action had left the statewithout power at this critical moment. The gov-
ernment was discredited and so was the Crown
when Mussolini, arriving comfortably in Rome in
a railway sleeping-car on the morning of 30October, accepted from the king the commissionto form a new government. Thus, the march on
Rome occurred after and not before Mussolini’s
assumption of the premiership. There was never,
in fact, a ‘seizure’ of power – though Fascist his-
toriography embroidered and gloriﬁed the event– only a threat to seize power. The Fascists alsodid not march on Rome but were conveyed in
special trains to the capital and there reviewed by
the king and the duce before being quickly
packed off home on 31 October. Yet without thethreat of seizing power Mussolini would not haveachieved his ends. The threat was real, though
whether he would have succeeded if he had
attempted to seize control of Rome is another,
much more debatable, question.Now that Mussolini was in power he had no pro-
gramme to place before parliament. He had con-

cerned himself solely with the problem of how to
attain power. Should he complete the ‘revolution’
now, as the Fascist militants expected, or should hemanipulate the parliamentary system and seek togovern at least pseudo-constitutionally? Should the
Fascist Party replace the state or should it be sub-

ordinated to the state? These important questions,1ITALY AND THE RISE OF FASCISM147
often asked, are in fact somewhat unreal. Whatmattered to Mussolini now that he had attainedpower was to retain as much of it personally in his
hands for as long as possible. He had no principles
or methods and despite talk of a new corporative
state, all relationships with existing institutions andorganisations possessing some power in the statewere subordinated to his will. His own Fascist
backers in this sense posed as much of an obstacle
to him as political opponents, the monarchy, the
papacy, the army and the bureaucracy. ‘Policy’ was
what Mussolini felt best served his interests in dealing with every group.Did Mussolini establish a ‘totalitarian’ regime?The monarchy was preserved, and the Church and
the armed forces enjoyed some independence,
while the independence of parliament was virtuallydestroyed. But Mussolini avoided a sudden revo-lutionary break; he allowed some degree of inde-
pendence, believing this to serve his interests. He
lacked in any case the iron will, utter ruthlessness
and total inhumanity of Hitler. Rather than makethe Fascist Party supreme, Mussolini preferred toleave some delegated power in the hands of rival
interest groups so that his task of domination
would be made easier. Mussolini understood in
his early years, before self-delusion blinded him,
that some voluntary limits on his exercise of power would make him more acceptable and sostrengthen his hold over government. The duce
was a complex character whose undoubted arro-
gance and insensitivity was complemented by
intelligence and unusual political skill.In October 1922 Mussolini made himself thehead of a government which looked not so dif-
ferent to previous government coalitions based on
personal bargaining. Included were the Catholics
and Conservatives. Mussolini, in addition to
holding the premiership, was also minister of theinterior and his own foreign minister. He won anoverwhelming vote of conﬁdence in parliament
for this government. His objective of breaking the
political power of other parties by inveigling the
majority to cooperate with him in national taskswas attained slowly but surely. When he felt suf-ﬁciently strong and secure, he backed a Fascist bill
for parliamentary ‘reform’, the Acerbo Bill. In
place of proportional representation this billestablished that the party gaining most votes (aslong as these amounted to at least 25 per cent ofthe total) should automatically secure two-thirds
of all the seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Since
the Fascists were inﬁltrating and taking over the
provincial administrations, they would be able toensure in any case that more than a quarter of thevotes were cast for the list of government candi-
dates. The bill passed in November 1923 made
certain that Mussolini would have at his disposal
a permanent majority of deputies ready to do his
will. The morale of any intending oppositionparties was consequently undermined. Intimida-tion played its part in persuading the deputies
lamely to consent to Mussolini’s retention of
power by legal and constitutional means. He
always hinted he could act differently, especiallyas he now had a private army, the former Fascistbands, which had been transformed into a volun-
tary militia of national security paid for by the
state and swearing allegiance to the duce, not 
the king.The elections of April 1924 were a triumph forMussolini. Intimidation and corruption to a
degree not practised before secured for his 
candidates two-thirds of all the votes cast. The
year 1924 was the last, nevertheless, in which
Mussolini could have been driven from power.There was a feeling of revulsion in the countrywhen a socialist deputy, Giacomo Matteotti, was
murdered by a Fascist gang after he had attacked
the corrupt elections in parliament. Mussolini was
taken aback by the sense of outrage; he wasaccused in parliament in June 1924 of being anaccomplice to murder, and a group of opposition
deputies withdrew in protest. But the king did
nothing. Mussolini rode out this, his ﬁrst and last
serious storm before his fall in 1943. In 1926 his
regime became more openly totalitarian with thesuppression of the free press.Just as Mussolini did not wish to be depend-ent on a genuine representative assembly, so he
did not intend to be at the mercy of Fascist fol-
lowers more revolutionary than he. In December1922 he created a Grand Council of Fascism overwhich he presided and which he dominated. In
October 1926 it was the turn of the independ-
ence of the Fascist Party to be undermined; all148THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
elections within the party were henceforth ended;the party was organised from above with Musso-
lini as its supreme head. Within two years the
party was bureaucratised and its violent activities
outside the law curbed.The Pope and the Catholic Church wereanother powerful and independent focus of powerin the state. With remarkable skill, Mussolini, an
avowed atheist, succeeded in reducing the polit-
ical inﬂuence of the Church. It had not been as
hostile to fascism as might have been expected,since it saw in fascism a bulwark against atheisticcommunism and socialism. The threat of social-
ism had already brought the Church back into the
politics of the Italian state before the war.
Mussolini built on this reconciliation of state and
Church. The outcome of long negotiations from1926 to 1929 was the Lateran Accords; by recog-nising papal sovereignty over the Vatican City, the
state returned to the papacy a token temporal
dominion in Italy; furthermore, Catholicism was
recognised as the sole religion of the state, and
much of the anti-clerical legislation was repealed.The treaty won for the Church a position in Italyit had not enjoyed since uniﬁcation. Judged as
Realpolitik,Vatican diplomacy was successful. But
what of the moral standing of the Church? This
was to be compromised even more when theVatican attempted to preserve Catholic interestsin Germany by concluding a concordat with
Hitler in 1933. Temporary advantages led to
long-term damage. The Church was inhibited
from taking a clear moral stand and from con-
demning outright the crimes against humanity1ITALY AND THE RISE OF FASCISM149

though individual priests, including the Pope,
sought to protect persecuted individuals.The positive contribution of fascism was sup-posed to be the introduction of the ‘corporatestate’. This was based on the idea that, instead of
being fought out, conﬂicts of interest were to be
negotiated under the guidance of the state in
bodies known as corporations. Thus, in 1925 the
employers’ federation and the fascist trade unionsrecognised each other as equal partners, and cor-porations to settle differences in many different
branches of industry, agriculture and education
were envisaged. A huge bureaucratic structure
was built up under a Ministry of Corporations.The industrialists, nevertheless, largely preservedtheir autonomy from the state. Not so the repre-
sentatives of labour – labour was now represented
in the corporations by fascist bureaucrats. The
workers were exploited and even their basic right to move from one job to another withoutofﬁcial permission was taken away. Real wages 
fell sharply, and fascism, despite some spectacular
schemes such as the expansion of wheat-growing
in the 1930s, and drainage of marsh land, could
not propel the underdeveloped economy for-ward. Economically, Italy remained backward and labour ceased to make social advances. The
increasing fascist bureaucracy, moreover, was 
a heavy burden to bear. Massive propagandashowing happy Italians and the duce stripped tothe waist in the ﬁelds might fool foreigners butcould not better the lot of the poor.The cult of the duce was substituted forgenuine progress. He posed as world leader, as
the greatest military genius and economic sage, asthe man who had transformed the civilised Italianpeople into conquering Romans. His conquests
in the 1920s were meagre, however. In Libya and
Somalia his troops fought savagely to reduce
poorly armed tribesmen. After ten years of ﬁght-
ing they were subjected. In no way was this a glo-
rious military episode. In the Balkans and theMiddle East there was little he could do without
British and French acquiescence. He tried in
1923, defying the League of Nations by seizing
the island of Corfu from the Greeks, using as apretext the murder of an Italian in Greece. ButBritain and France intervened and, after ﬁnding a
face-saving formula, Mussolini had to withdraw.
He did, however, secure Fiume for Italy in the
following year. All in all it was not very heroic.For the rest, Mussolini unsuccessfully tried toexploit Balkan differences and sought the lime-
light by signing many treaties. So, abroad, he 
was mistakenly judged as a sensible statesman.
Conservatives even admired the superﬁcial order
he had imposed on Italy’s rich and varied life. The1930s were to reveal to the world what his oppo-nents in Italy and the colonies had already learnt
to their cost – the less benevolent aspects of
Mussolini’s rule.150THE GREAT WAR, REVOLUTION AND THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY
1Part IV
THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS,1929–39The despair of poverty is hard to imagine forthose who have never suffered it. A decade after
the conclusion of the Great War the era of the
Great Depression began, reducing millions ofpeople in the advanced Western world to thelevels of grinding poverty suffered throughout the
twentieth century by humanity in Asia, South
America and Africa. The peoples living in the
empires of the West now fell even below the
barest subsistence levels as the price they couldobtain for their raw materials dropped precipi-tously. Their economies were dependent on the
demand of the West. Whatever befell the indus-
trialised West, the effects on the poor of what we
now call the Third World were even more cata-strophic. At the time only one country appearedimmune – the Soviet Union, where industrial pro-
duction increased. It was a persuasive argument
to some that communism provided the only solu-
tion to the periodic booms and depressions that
bedevilled the trade cycle. But in the SovietUnion, Stalin’s state planning actually imposedhardships as great as, and greater than, anything
happening in the West.The effect of the depression was aggravated byits occurring before the trauma of the Great Warhad been overcome. It is the shortness of timethat elapsed between one shock and the next that
gives the years from 1919 to 1939 their particu-
lar characteristic. These years came to be viewed
as a ‘continuing world crisis’. The industrialdepression that began in 1929 had been precededby an agricultural depression dating from 1921,not really overcome in the mid-1920s, and then
rapidly deepening after 1926. The ‘boom years’
of industrial expansion of the 1920s, thus, werenot as uniformly prosperous as often supposed.For all its startling psychological repercussions,
the Wall Street Crash on ‘black Tuesday’, 29
October 1929, did not cause the depression. The
Western world, despite its attempts to return to
the ‘normality’ of the pre-1914 years, was unableto do so after the Great War. But each nationsought to return to pre-war practices, some like
Britain to the gold standard, sound money and
balanced budgets, with disastrous results.The new problem of Allied war debts andGerman reparations did necessitate a freshapproach and international discussion and coop-
eration. During the 1920s, before 1931 when all
these payments came practically to a halt, the
international settlements followed a circular route
of German reparations payments constantly scaleddown, making possible the payment of Allieddebts to the US also scaled down, while American
loans to Germany, exceeding German reparations
payments, completed the circle. This was not very
sensible ﬁnancially, but the actual sums involved,though not the principal cause of the breakdownof world trade, contributed to the disruption of
international ﬁnance by the end of the decade.Study of the economic development of eachWestern nation reveals how far the depression ofthe 1930s had causes going back even before the1Chapter 15THE DEPRESSION, 1929–39First World War. Britain, for example, continuedto rely on textile, coal and shipbuilding industries
of the ﬁrst industrial revolution, and was shifting
only slowly, too slowly, to industries of the moreadvanced technology of the twentieth century.This lack of progress caused continuous and
heavy unemployment even during the 1920s,
when only in one year did unemployment drop
below 10 per cent.The US provided a contrast, with the massivegrowth of new consumer industries such as theautomobile industry and with unemployment at
around only 4 per cent. The problem here was
that these new industries did not produce neces-
sities and the decision not to buy a new carbecause of a lack of faith in the future couldproduce a sudden reversal of fortunes in manu-
facturing industry. But it was not until 1931 that
unemployment became the serious problem thatit had been in Britain throughout the 1920s. TheFrench economy was different again, with half the
population engaged in agriculture. But post-war
reconstruction favoured the rise of new industriesand by 1930 France had emerged strengthened,even requiring foreign labour. The effect of the
worldwide depression was stagnation throughout
the 1930s.In Germany the impact of the world economiccrisis was conditioned by the particular experi-ences of Germans since the lost war. Having onceexperienced hyperinﬂation, which made money
worthless, the government was determined to pre-
serve sound money regardless of the cost in terms
of unemployment. Agricultural prosperity had suf-fered a serious setback some two years before in1929, while German industry boomed. The later
1920s saw the afﬁrmation of large industrial car-
tels and the introduction of new technology.154THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
New Yorkers mill around Wall Street, October 1929. Can it get worse? © Bettmann/CorbisGermany not only ﬁnanced this modernisation byattracting loans from the US but also paid offreparations from loans. Other American loans
ﬁnanced unproductive municipal projects such as
town halls and swimming baths. Much of this 
loan capital could be recalled at short notice andwhen this happened in 1929 the economy, already affected by declining international mar-
kets, threatened to spin out of control. The larg-
est Western percentage of unemployed was
Germany’s in 1932 with 30 per cent out of work.The state of the US economy was the commondenominator in the world economic crisis. TheAmerican economy had assumed such importance
that the other Western economies depended on
its good health. There is thus general agreement
that the origins of great worldwide depression areto be sought in the US. With the Americaneconomy running down, the prices of raw mater-ials slumped; markets all over the world con-
tracted as a result. When the US reduced the ﬂowof capital abroad, and in 1930 created a prohibi-
tive tariff which prevented the European powers
from selling their goods in the US, the rest of the
world could no longer cope.There were weaknesses in the economic struc-
ture of European nations that had already made
themselves felt, as in Britain, before 1929. The
American recession turned these problems into a
severe crisis. The depression proved to be not just
a short downturn in the business cycle, as had beenexpected. The bad year from 1929 to 1930 wasfollowed by an even worse year in 1931. When
1932 brought no relief, hope of an automatic
upturn collapsed. World economic conditions did
improve from the low point of 1931–2 but onlygradually. The world depression continued downto the Second World War, which, like the First,1THE DEPRESSION, 1929–39155
An unemployed German war veteran, 1930. The gratitude of the fatherland. © akg-imagestransformed economic activity and absorbed theunemployed to feed the war machine. Such a longand deep depression was a new experience and
governments were at a loss as to how best to 
handle the economic problems of their day. In
Germany from 1931 to 1933, they made mattersworse.The depression also provided a test for the dif-ferent forms of government by which the peoples
of the world were ruled. They were inevitably
judged by ordinary people according to how
effective they perceived them to be in ﬁndingremedies for the ills of depression, unemploymentforemost among them. In people’s minds, the
communist, the various fascist and Nazi ‘models’,
the conduct of the democratic governments, as
well as colonial rule, could in these circumstancesbe compared.Any government and political system that hap-pened to exist during the early depression years
was bound to be blamed for the widespread
misery. But those authoritarian governments thatwere already ﬁrmly established by 1929 were in abetter position to maintain themselves by brute
force and to manipulate the attitudes of the
masses through propaganda. Popular discontent
could no longer threaten the Soviet system of
communist rule. The Western colonial empireswere under ﬁrm military control. Mussolini stiﬂedprotest: strikes were prohibited by law; the Italian
state set low rates of interest; and the Institute for
Industrial Reconstruction was created in January
1933 to assist Italian banks, which in turn led tothe state assuming direct responsibility for a rangeof industry from shipping to steel. Nevertheless,
unemployment in Italy remained stubbornly high
in the early 1930s and the standard of living 
persistently low. Yet there was no open criticism
as Mussolini advertised himself, photographedstripped to the waist with spade in hand andworking on public works projects.Hitler came to power during the most seriousperiod of depression and he quickly consolidated
dictatorial power. Nevertheless, it was his evidentsuccess in reducing unemployment in Germanyfrom 6 million in October 1933 to just over 4
million a year later and 2.8 million in 1935 that
so increased national popular support for him.Rearmament and army expansion after 1936 vir-tually eliminated unemployment in Germany.Whatever evils came to be associated with Hitler’s
rule in the eyes of the people, they gave Hitler
credit for ‘curing’ unemployment. Hitler recog-
nised that he could turn the prevailing despair tohis advantage if he could infuse a spirit of action,convey concern for the plight of the unemployed
and actually put people to work. His success was
not instantaneous; it was achieved, moreover, by
forcibly destroying the independence of labour. It
was achieved, too, in the face of traditionalbanking advice. Hitler listened to the Keynesian-type economists in Germany who had met with
rejection by Brüning. Hjalmar Schacht, who
returned as president of the Reichsbank, created
large paper credits. Money was spent on newsuperhighways – the Autobahnen, which had mil-itary value – on expanding rearmament and on
support for agriculture. The Nazi economy was
tightly controlled by the state in order to achieve
self-sufﬁciency in agriculture – and as far as pos-sible in industry – without replacing the actualprivate ownership of industry or the land.At the price of liberty, the Nazi economy from1933 to 1939 was successful in maintaining stable
prices, full employment, eventually, and a modest
rise in the standard of living of the working man.Rearmament was not allowed to cut standards ofliving drastically. Hitler was anxious to win and
retain German support by providing economic
and social beneﬁts, and used violence only against
open opponents from the beginning and againstthe Jews from 1938. The authoritarian models’apparent good points, which were proclaimed by
their own captive press, radio and ﬁlm, impressed
the unemployed in the democracies more than
the bad. But the German economy by 1939 was
heading for the rocks, which only a successful warcould evade. Democratic governments requiringthe cooperation of parliament looked less effec-
tive and more cumbersome by comparison.Poincaré’s government of national union hadrestored French ﬁnances to health in 1926. Theelections of 1928 had given the right a great
victory, but his retirement a year later, due to
illness and exhaustion, marked the end of an era156THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
in which France had attempted to reassert itsstanding as a great power in Europe, and coin-cided also with the time when the depression
became more serious worldwide. French govern-
ments after Poincaré lost their stability once
more: between 1929 and 1934 they lasted anaverage of three or four months. Albert Lebrun,elected president in 1932, remained until the fall
of France in 1940, but he was a colourless politi-
cian who gave no lead. At ﬁrst, the strength of
France’s financial position seemed to make it
immune, alone among the Western nations, fromthe debacle following the crash in October 1929in the US. Throughout 1930 unemployment
remained low. But in the autumn of 1931 the
slump and unemployment finally spread to
France. French governments now sought byﬁnancial ‘orthodoxy’ to meet the crisis, simulta-neously cutting pensions, salaries and public
expenditure. The cessation of German reparation
payments in 1931, coupled with the Americans’
continuing insistence on repayment of debts,compounded the difficulty. Despite devaluingonce in 1928, successive governments until 
1936 added to France’s problems by refusing to
devalue an overvalued franc which made the task
of exporting increasingly hard. During the worst
years from 1933 to 1934 the survival of theRepublic itself seemed very doubtful. Big businessand the extreme right admired the fascist model
as an authoritarian solution behind which they
could operate proﬁtably. Among politicians of the
right, Pierre Laval and André Tardieu as well asMarshal Pétain, the hero of Verdun, inclinedtowards some sort of authoritarian resolution for
the troubles and divisions of the Republic.The unpopular measures of successive Frenchgovernments in a parliamentary Chamber of pre-
dominantly centre and left-wing parties, as well asfear of communism, played into the hands of theright. The Socialists led by Léon Blum would 
not join any coalition government that included
the ‘bourgeois’ Radical-Socialists, whose main
support came from the conservative peasantry andthe middle classes and whose aims were not in theleast socialist. The communists under Maurice
Thorez meanwhile followed the Moscow line of
the Comintern, which ordered them to regard theDemocratic Socialist Party as their greatestenemy. So governments were formed mainly bythe Radical parliamentary leaders seeking align-
ments to the right. The impact of the depression
gravely weakened and divided the left, with the
communists until 1934 pursuing an apparentlyinsane tactic of undermining the stability of theRepublic that might well have helped fascism to
power in France as it had done earlier in
Germany. The realisation of the folly of the
Moscow course dawned on Thorez and in 1934
he became a leading and successful advocate ofchanging it.The years 1933 and 1934 also saw the growthin France of paramilitary fascist ‘leagues’ whose
bands of rowdies brawled in the streets of Paris
like Nazi storm troopers. There was the royalistAction Française, the oldest of the leaguesfounded before the First World War. Another was
the Jeunesses Patriotes composed mainly of stu-
dents. François Coty, the perfume millionaire,
financed the Solidarité Française and a fascist journal, L’Ami du peuple. The most important ofthese leagues was the Croix de Feu, made up of
war veterans led by Colonel de la Rocque, whose
main aim was the negative one of overthrowing
the parliamentary Republic. Royalism, extreme
Catholicism, anti-Semitism, other movementsinspired by Mussolini’s and Hitler’s examples, allhad little in common except a determination to
undermine the Republic. With this aim the polit-
ically opposite Communist Party at first also
agreed, and the communists were even ready towork in parallel with fascists to achieve this object.The leagues were supported by numerous vicious
Parisian newspapers which were constantly stirring
up popular hatred against the legislators.At the worst possible moment, with the gov-ernment discredited by its instability and inepthandling of the depression, with ﬁnancial hard-ship deepening and polarising class antagonism,
the politicians were smeared with the taint of cor-
ruption by what became known as the Stavisky
scandal. Stavisky was a swindler who had throughthe years ﬂoated a number of bonds and sharesthat defrauded the investors. Although arrested,
he had enjoyed a strange immunity from trial, in
the meantime making more money from shady1THE DEPRESSION, 1929–39157
deals. In January 1934 he shot himself, and thepolice, who could have saved his life, allowed himto die. It was rumoured that his death had
shielded highly placed politicians and the police
from the revelation of their involvement in his
crimes and in these allegations there was un-
doubtedly some truth. All the anti-parliamentaryforces seized on the scandal to make a concerted
effort to overthrow not only the government but
the Republic. The members of the various leagues
were summoned in their thousands onto the
streets of Paris to oust the politicians. The climaxwas reached during the night of 6 February 1934when street battles raged in Paris; the police and
Garde Mobile narrowly gaining the upper hand.
Hundreds of demonstrators were wounded, 
some seriously, and it is surprising that the deathtoll – some eighteen people – was relatively small.The supposedly strong government under the
Radical prime minister Édouard Daladier turned
out to be weak after all and promptly resigned.
The Republic was saved by a few of its resolutedefenders among the Paris police by luck and,above all, by the total disunity of the leaders of
the right. There was no Hitler or even Mussolini
among them.Weak French governments, which could ﬁndno solution to the political, social and economicproblems, succeeded each other during the nexttwo years. The elections of May 1936, however,
seemed to herald a turning point: the parties of
the left – the Socialists and Communists –
together with the Radicals had by then formed anelectoral alliance, the Popular Front. This extra-ordinary change had been made possible by the
volte-face of the French Communist Party. In
June 1934 the Communists and Socialists had
overcome their mutual suspicions to join in a
United Front to fight fascism. The reasons for the change have fascinated historians, for the Communists had regarded the Democratic
Socialists, or ‘social fascists’ as they called them,
as their worst enemies. They accused them of
leading the proletariat away from the true goal ofcommunist revolution under the guise of repre-senting the working people’s class interests. The
fascists, on the other hand, could be recognised
as the enemy of the proletariat and were but apassing phenomenon associated with the laterstages of capitalism before its inevitable demise.Outside the Soviet Union, some of the com-
munist parties that subscribed to the Soviet-
controlled Comintern began to question thesedoctrinaire views. How could all Social Democratsbe regarded as enemies when they were ﬁghting

the same foe as in Austria, where the SocialDemocrats forcibly resisted the authoritarian cleri-
cal Dollfuss government and were, in 1934, bom-

barded into submission in Vienna? In Germany
Hitler’s Nazis looked like consolidating theirpower. Communists languished in concentrationcamps, their party organisation smashed. There
was a serious danger that fascism would win powerin other European countries. The French commu-
nist leader, Maurice Thorez, became especially
fearful of a fascist triumph in France. The French
Communist Party took the lead in creating a newUnited Front with the Socialists. They could nothave openly disobeyed the Comintern in Moscow.
But the Soviet leadership was divided and per-
suaded by the brilliant Bulgarian communistleader, George Dimitrov, the hero of the Reichstag
ﬁre trial, to allow some latitude and experimenta-

tion of tactics. From the summer of 1934 onwardsThorez pushed on, the Soviet leaders acquiescing.The socialist and communist trade unions merged.
Not satisﬁed with a socialist alliance alone, Thorezextended the alignment even further to include the‘bourgeois’ Radicals, and so turned the United
Front into the much broader Popular Front. The
electoral pact of the three parties – Socialist,Communist and Radical – gave the Popular Frontelectoral victory over the right in the spring of
1936 and brought Léon Blum to power as primeminister. Though the Radicals did least well, theCommunists gained greatly and the three parties
together won 378 seats against the right’s 220.
The electoral arrangements, rather than a largeshift in the voting, had achieved this result. ButFrench society remained more divided than ever.
This polarisation was as important as the electionresults. Léon Blum had taken no part in the elec-
tions. He had been nearly beaten to death in the
street when fanatics of the Action Française had set
upon him. Fortunately, he was rescued by buildingworkers who happened to be nearby. That was theother side of French politics.158THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
The right now assailed Blum, who headed thePopular Front government, not only for servingas a cover for the communists, but also as an alien,
as a Jew. In few countries outside Nazi Germanywas anti-Semitism as crude and virulent as insome sections of French society. Blum was sensi-
tive to these attacks; he followed in the socialist
traditions of paciﬁsm and humane considerationfor the poor. He could never quite rise above theviciousness of the onslaught on him and too self-
consciously sought to prove himself a patriot andconciliator. In his Cabinet when facing oppositionhe was prone to indecision and weakness, as
became very clear when the Popular Front gov-
ernment in Madrid appealed to France for help atthe outset of the Spanish Civil War. There wasevery reason why the French Popular Front gov-
ernment should help republican Spain with arms,not only on ideological grounds but also becausea fascist victory threatened to encircle France.
This, too, was Blum’s view. But the outcry of the
right and the weakness of his Radical and Socialistministerial colleagues changed Blum’s mind andhe reversed his earlier decision to respond to
Madrid’s appeal.In domestic affairs, Blum’s government scoredone spectacular success. At the time that he took
ofﬁce, France was hit by a huge wave of strikes and
factory sit-ins. Discontent with low wages andpoor working conditions in industry and on theland had ﬁnally led to this confrontation which
served notice to the politicians that as in otherWestern countries – except, of course, in fascistItaly and Nazi Germany – organised labour
demanded basic rights and higher wages. The
employers and propertied were thoroughly fright-
ened. Blum brought the employers and the tradeunionists – the Confédération Générale du Travail
–together at his official residence, the Hôtel
Matignon on Sunday, 7 June. After a night’s dis-
cussion there emerged a package: a substantial
wage increase, two weeks’ paid holiday, a forty-
hour week and, most important of all, the employ-
ers’ acceptance of the trade unions’ bargainingrights; in return the unions would persuade the
workers to end their sit-ins and the strikes.Believing themselves on the verge of social revolu-
tion, parliament rushed this constructive legisla-

tion through in a few days – an uncharacteristicshow of good sense and urgency. Industrial peacewas restored for a time. But the impact of the Blumgovernment on the health of the economy was
small, despite the belated devaluation of the francin October 1936. Blum was determined to workpaciﬁcally, by seeking the cooperation of big busi-

ness and high ﬁnance, which loathed all his gov-

ernment stood for. There was to be no enforcedsocialism. After a year, the stagnating economy andprice rises had wiped out much of the advantage
the workers had gained by wage rises.Soon after coming to ofﬁce, Blum banned the‘leagues’. This proved as ineffectual as in Germany
in 1932. The leagues assumed a new ‘legitimate’
political garb – but the street brawling continuedas before. A particularly violent clash between thecommunists and the right in March 1937 ended 
in bloodshed; it horriﬁed Blum and damaged thereputation of the Popular Front. Blum was readyto resign immediately but, in the end, carried on.
He resigned three months later, in June 1937, 
disillusioned and frustrated in his domestic andforeign policies, when a hostile Senate, dominatedby the Radicals, refused to give him the powers 
he had asked for so that his government could deal with the ﬁnancial crisis. For a further year ahollowed-out Popular Front continued. The dis-
unity of the left, its weakness, the bitterness of
class war, which even took the form of making itfashionable on the right to mouth ‘better Hitlerthan Blum’, allowed government to fall into the
hands of a coalition of the disunited Radicals and the right. Édouard Daladier in April 1938emerged as another supposedly ‘strong’ man
whose actual performance belied his reputation.
His finance minister, Paul Reynaud, tried torestore the economy by increased taxation and alonger working week. The employers, recovered
from the early days of the Popular Front, wereable to redress the balance again in their favourbut at the expense of social bitterness. The reper-
cussions for world peace of France’s feebleness
were immense. It was a misfortune that all thisoccurred when across France’s eastern frontier adetermined and ruthless dictator was taking full
advantage of the French political and social crisis.Political division at the centre of government inthe years between the wars did not lie at the root1THE DEPRESSION, 1929–39159
of Britain’s social and economic difficulties.Indeed, it is difﬁcult to think of any two decades of
British history where there was such unanimity.
The Liberal Party never recovered sufﬁciently to

provide an alternative government. The role was
taken over by the Labour Party. Labour had brieﬂy
formed a minority government in 1924, and thenagain from 1929 to 1931. Just three years after the
conclusion of the General Strike, Baldwin in May
1929 went to the country conﬁdent of electoral

victory. The total Labour vote (8.4 million) was
slightly lower than the Conservative (8.7 million),but the constituency electoral system gave Labourmore seats, 289 against the Conservatives’ 260,
while lack of proportional representation penalised
the Liberals who, despite their 5.3 million votes,
gained only 59 seats. There was less practical difference between Ramsay MacDonald’s brand ofLabour policies and the policies of the Con-

servatives than between the policies of either party
and those of the Liberals. It was the Liberals who
put forward a radically different economic strategymasterminded by the most famous economicthinker of the age, John Maynard Keynes. He and
others produced the pre-election plan Britain’sIndustrial Future, which advocated governmentspending as the spearhead to industrial revival. 
‘We Can Conquer Unemployment’ was LloydGeorge’s more popular election version of thisplan. Lloyd George, with his own ‘brains trust’
behind him, was ready to provide the British
people with their ‘New Deal’. But there was to be
no political comeback for Lloyd George.Labour became the alternative to the Con-servatives. Its leadership was anxious not to
present the party as too socialist, let alone as rev-
olutionary, as the communists had no electoral
appeal. The left wing of the Labour movement
found itself isolated, shunned both by the com-munists who were following the Comintern lineof ﬁghting the ‘social fascists’ and by the bulk of
the trade unions and the moderate Labour right.
Despite Ramsay MacDonald’s commitment to a
Labour Party whose theoretical aim was to trans-form capitalism into socialism, as leader of theparty he saw this as some very distant objective,
certainly not practical politics in 1929. The pre-
dominant majority of the Labour Party has stoodbehind leaders who warned that to embrace far-reaching socialist measures, such as bringing thegreater part of industry under state control,
would alienate the electorate and condemn the
party to permanent opposition. The move to the
left needed to be gradual and pragmatic.The Labour minority government which Mac-Donald formed in June 1929 largely excluded the
Labour left. The electoral programme had soft-
pedalled socialism and the whole issue of public
ownership, except for the coal industry (and even
the Conservatives were to move eventually towardssome form of state supervision over the coal indus-
try); Labour owed its electoral success to this
stance of ‘respectability’. Philip Snowden, chan-

cellor of the exchequer, was as orthodox, as sternly
opposed to unbalanced budgets and as fearful ofinﬂation as any Conservative chancellor.The most serious problem facing Britain athome throughout the 1920s was unemployment,
which persisted at over 1 million, more than 10
per cent of the labour force. This average for thewhole country does not reveal its full seriousness,since unemployment was far more severe in
Clydeside in Scotland and Tyneside in north-east
England where shipbuilding was in the doldrums,
in the coal-mining valleys of south Wales, 
in Ulster and in the textile region of south Lanca-shire. Whole regions were blighted, sunk inpoverty with unemployment persisting year after
year. The famous hunger marches to London in
the 1930s helped to draw the ‘forgotten’ regions
to the attention of the more prosperous Midlandsand southern England. It brought home to theman in the street the desperate and seemingly
hopeless plight of the unemployed. The coming
to power of the Labour government was followed
within a few weeks by the Wall Street Crash. 
The effects of the American depression soonspread to Britain. Unemployment rapidly rose.The government attempted nothing that might
have stemmed this rise. Within the government
Oswald Mosley, taking his cue from Keynes,
recommended radical measures to deal withunemployment. He resigned from the govern-
ment in May 1930 having failed to persuade his
colleagues, and eventually left the party after 
his motion against government unemployment160THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
policies was defeated at the party conference inOctober and further efforts to change the party’spolicies proved fruitless. His authoritarian incli-
nations have obscured the question whether his
economic judgements were sound. Once consid-
ered a potential leader of the Labour Party, hecame to lead instead the British Union of Fascistsand left the mainstream of British politics.Labour’s meagre legislative record, with unem-ployment rising to 2.8 million by the summer of
1931, had severely weakened MacDonald’s stand-
ing in both the country and in the Labour Partywhen the ﬁnancial crisis hit London. The Labourgovernment had sought to follow ﬁnancial policies
acceptable to the orthodox bankers and adopted a
course above parties – thus diminishing its inde-
pendence of action. Policy recommendations wereleft to commissions and committees of experts.These orthodox financiers now recommended
that government expenditure be cut by lowering
wages of government employees, by reducing
unemployment beneﬁts and by raising new taxa-tion. MacDonald’s colleagues baulked, but even-tually agreed to most of these measures. They
went much against the grain even of the Labour
moderates. When MacDonald insisted, on the
advice of the bankers, on the full cuts, a minority
of the Cabinet, backed by the General Council ofthe Trades Union Congress, which opposed allcuts, would not accept further economies. The
realisation was growing that the government, in
simply giving in to the ﬁnanciers, would separate
itself from the bulk of the Labour movement. Ifthe policy were necessary, would it not be betterto have left it to the Opposition?At the suggestion of the bankers, who urgedMacDonald that the prime need was to restore
international conﬁdence in the government – a

loan from the US was said to be conditional on suf-
ficiently stringent government economies –MacDonald and Snowden had already conferred
with the leaders of the Opposition. At the height
of the crisis King George V played a leading role in
persuading MacDonald, Baldwin and the Liberalsto join in a new ‘national government’. LloydGeorge, who might have blocked a coalition led by
MacDonald, was in hospital. On 24 August 1931
the king’s personal appeal was ‘loyally’ acceded to,such was still the inherent inﬂuence of the Crown.
The next day, MacDonald headed a new nationalgovernment with Baldwin serving under him. Only
three Labour Cabinet ministers, including Snow-

den, followed MacDonald. The Labour Party for-

mally rejected the national government and votedfor a new leader. At the general election which fol-
lowed in October 1931 the Labour Party suffered
a devastating defeat. They could hold only ﬁfty-

two seats. The Conservatives won a corresponding
victory of 471 seats and so an absolute majority.
The Liberals were soon as badly split as Labour;after supporting the national government for atime about half the sixty-eight MPs, in 1932,
turned against it. MacDonald’s National Labour
following was reduced to thirteen. In all but name,
Britain was ruled by the Conservatives until 1940.MacDonald had genuinely believed in a ﬁnancial
crisis and had been panicked into action that the
Labour Party regarded as a betrayal.What was the domestic record of the Conservative-National administrations, MacDonald’s (1931–5),Baldwin’s (1935–7) and Neville Chamberlain’s
(1937–40), in meeting the social and industrial ills
of Britain? There can be no doubt that these gov-

ernments followed policies that they believed
would most effectively alleviate the distress ofunemployment and would cure the sickness fromwhich the British economy suffered. They did care.
But their political philosophy and economic think-

ing precluded them from following the communist
or fascist totalitarian remedies. They also rejectedthe notion that government could initiate publicspending sufﬁciently large to mop up unemploy-

ment regardless of other harmful effects on the
economy such spending would have had. The fact
that the national government with its tiny Liberal
and Labour components in Parliament but backedby the overall Conservative majority could actdecisively without fear of parliamentary defeat, in
itself, helped to restore conﬁdence. MacDonald,

followed by Baldwin in 1935, presided over their
cabinets as prime minister, but the rising star wasNeville Chamberlain, who became chancellor ofthe exchequer in the depth of the depression in
November 1931. Winston Churchill might have
become the real force in these governments of the1THE DEPRESSION, 1929–39161
1930s had he not quarrelled with Baldwin and theConservative majority when the Conservativeswere still in opposition over how to deal with the
problem of Indian nationalism. The Labour gov-

ernment supported by Baldwin wished to make
concessions; Churchill thundered against appeas-
ing Indian nationalism and resigned from theConservative shadow Cabinet. It was a tragic mis-

judgement not only as regards India but possibly in
its effect on world history. Churchill was politically
isolated in the 1930s and when he warned against
appeasing Hitler, most of the Conservatives didnot listen.The later 1930s belonged to Chamberlain notChurchill. Chamberlain tackled the economic
problem with the characteristic vigour he had
already displayed as minister of health in the1920s. Nevertheless, government policies werepretty cautious. They were less spectacular, but
arguably more effective, than Roosevelt’s in
America. Chamberlain sought to create condi-

tions that would allow British industry to revive.Recovery was not, however, all a matter of gov-ernment economic planning. Equally important
was the behaviour of the British people – those
in employment – who by their spending gradu-
ally helped to lift Britain out of the slump.Already in September 1931 Britain had goneoff the gold standard and devalued its currencyby a quarter so as to make British exports more
competitive. It followed the US in adopting a
protective tariff to discourage competitive imports
from abroad; a limited degree of imperial prefer-ence was agreed by the Imperial EconomicConference at Ottawa of July/August 1932,
which lowered mutual tariffs in the Common-
wealth, stimulating empire trade. Currency con-
trol was introduced and not eased until 1979 (it
was abolished soon after). Cheap credit stimu-lated the domestic economy, especially in thehouse-building trade. Schemes of direct govern-
ment subsidies and marketing boards also greatly
aided the British farmer. The government sought
to rationalise and produce a more uniform systemof unemployment beneﬁts. The intentions weregood, but the resulting family ‘means tests’,
which investigated whether a whole family had
sufﬁcient for its needs even if one of its memberswas out of work, came to symbolise the heartlessbureaucracy of what was intended as a sensiblepolicy. The echoes of the resulting bitterness
made themselves felt for decades.Class distinction was more acceptable to theman in the street in good times, or in the war when
common hardships and dangers were being shared
by the upper and lower classes in the trenches. In
the 1930s the increasing division between rich and
poor, employed and unemployed, left bitter mem-
ories of Conservative rule that not even WinstonChurchill’s personal popularity could overcome in
1945. The Prince of Wales, by his well-publicised
concern for the misery of the unemployed, did
something to bridge the gap. The abdication crisis
of November and December 1936, which forced
Edward VIII to renounce the throne unless he
gave up his proposed marriage to the divorced Mrs
Simpson, was seen by some embittered working
men as a manoeuvre to get rid of a king who
sympathised with them.Unemployment, nevertheless, in the mid-1930s was slowly declining. It never reached the
proportions of German and American unemploy-
ment at their peak in 1932–3, and fell steadilyfrom 1933 to 1937 from just under 3 million to1.7 million. Even with rearmament getting under
way thereafter, it did not fall below 1 million and
since it was heavily concentrated in the depressed
areas it actually varied from 26 per cent in
Northern Ireland and 24 per cent in Wales to 6
per cent in the Midlands. Such gestures as subsi-
dising the completion of the liner Queen Mary onthe Clyde and other limited public schemes could
not touch the hard-core unemployment problems
of these regions. This, rather than the fact that
total production in 1934 exceeded the level of
1929, was what made the deepest impact on the
public mind in the 1930s.One serious consequence of the depression wasthat the democracies became preoccupied with
problems at home. Chamberlain saw rearmament
as a waste of national resources. Gradually recovery
was proceeding. For those in work living standards
were rising rather than falling. War threatened the
better way of life governments were seeking to
achieve for their peoples. But it was the war effort162THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
alone that ‘cured’ unemployment in Britain andthe US.The social consequences of the depression, thedespair of the unemployed, the failure to provideadequately for the poor and the sick, the under-
nourishment of millions of children, unhealthy
slum housing and many other ills in the early
years of the 1930s turned the mass of people onthe continent of Europe towards a search for new solutions. Since Stalin’s Russia appeared to
have found the answer to banishing the capitalist 
trade cycle, communism attracted millions. Their
support was given not only for materialistic butalso for idealistic reasons. Communists foughtfascism and in claiming to provide a better and
healthier life for the poor acted in a way that
seemed ethical and good. The realities of Stalin’s
tyrannical regime were unknown to many, over-
looked or explained away. Mussolini and Hitlerwere seen by millions as the saviours who wouldrestore a sense of national unity, orderly govern-
ment and employment to their people. They had
many admirers outside Italy and Germany, even
some in Britain. The deep divisions and theturmoil in France discredited parliamentary gov-ernment in this part of Europe too. In Britain,
the Labour government had ignominiously fallen,
though parliament itself survived the crisis.
Humane and democratic socialism was every-

where the main victim. Such desperate condi-
tions, millions of people felt, demanded notcompromise but radical remedies. The left battled
the right politically, in Spain even on the battle-ﬁeld. But there was at least one country in Europewhere humanity, democracy and social progresswere safe and which did not follow the pattern of
most of the rest of the continent.Sweden had not bypassed the depression, but theeconomic slump led to the establishment of ademocratic form of government which deter-

mined the social and economic policies of the
country for almost six decades. It was ceasing tobe a predominantly agricultural country: its steel,ball-bearings and other advanced industrial prod-
ucts like telephones were in worldwide demand,
in addition to its older exports such as wood-pulpand matches. Nonetheless, in this large, under-populated northern region of Europe, farming
continued to play an important role in the 1930s.The impact of the depression, at its height in1932 and 1933, was devastating. One in three ofthe workforce was unemployed; many farmers
could no longer meet their mortgages and were
forced to sell. But Sweden recovered relativelyquickly from the crash compared to the rest ofEurope and it was politically strong and stable.
The credit for this must go largely to the coali-
tion administration of the Farmers’ Party and theSocial Democrats, led by the Social Democrat PerAlbin Hansson. In the ﬁrst three years of the
administration, bills to promote active state inter-
vention were passed, regulating the workinghours of agricultural labourers, statutory holidaysand unemployment insurance. The simple slogan
was to make Sweden ‘a home for all its people’
and so to create social harmony.By 1939 Sweden’s unemployment problemhad been solved and the plans for a welfare state
had been worked out. The Social Democrats,
since their election victory in 1936, had becomethe dominant political force in the country. Thewar postponed the extension of social welfare, but
from 1946 to 1950 the reforms were enacted,
including comprehensive old-age pensions, child
allowances, health insurance and educationalreforms. The Swedish people were to be safe-guarded from ‘cradle to grave’, in sickness and in
health. The socialist element of the government
policies was to tax the better-off heavily to pay forthe welfare state and to redistribute income,rather than to try to nationalise private industry.1THE DEPRESSION, 1929–39163

For once a utopian vision seemed to correspondto reality. Sweden and its people prospered.Swedish research, technology and design were
second to none. The Social Democratic domin-
ance for all but six years since 1932 came to anend only in 1992.Sweden exemplified a distinctive and muchadmired social, political and cultural way of life.
The emphasis on closeness to nature and on indi-
vidual choice and liberty extended to the sphereof sexual permissiveness long before it did so inthe rest of Europe. In many areas of social reform
Sweden was the pioneer. The Swedes enjoyed one
of the highest standards of living in Europe, 
along with the Swiss, the Norwegians, the Finns,the Germans and the people of Luxembourg.Swedish society was egalitarian and unshakeably
democratic, although it had to make readjust-
ments in the early 1990s.The hopes of those who continued to pin theirfaith on liberalism and democracy in the 1930s asproviding a better answer to the world’s ills than
totalitarian leadership, came to rest on Franklin
Delano Roosevelt. Roosevelt’s New Deal was 
to be the answer to those who, in the crisis,despaired of reconciling freedom with the meas-ures necessary to bring about economic recovery.
Keynes wrote in December 1933 that Roosevelt
had made himself ‘the trustee for those in every
country who seek to mend the evils of our con-
dition. If you [Roosevelt] fail, rational change willbe gravely prejudiced throughout the world,leaving orthodoxy or revolution to fight it 
out.’ The shortcomings of the New Deal are very
evident to historians today. Unemployment
remained obstinately high. It fell from some 13million in 1933 to under 8 million in 1937 butit rose again to 9.5 million in 1939. In fact,
Roosevelt’s administrations failed to ‘cure’ the
blight and waste of human resources until the US
geared industry to war. But the attitude of the
president and administration, brilliantly publi-
cised, gave renewed hope to the nation and pro-vided leadership without the destruction of
democracy. There is thus a stark contrast between
the general psychological impact of the New Deal
and the real success of the many different laws,special agencies and programmes which consti-tuted it.The depression provided Roosevelt with theopportunity of attaining and retaining political
power for more than a decade until his death in
1945. But its onset destroyed the political powerof his predecessor at the White House, HerbertHoover. Hoover in 1929 had begun his term at
the moment of highest conﬁdence. The failure of
his economic policies to halt the steep rise in
unemployment shattered his reputation. He had
a clear concept of the role of the state. He wishedto limit federal powers, which he warned wouldthrottle individual initiative. He was by conviction
a conservative, though he was willing to adopt
new ways to stimulate business. His inability,
nevertheless, to halt the steep slide into depres-sion did more than discredit him personally, italso discredited the whole philosophy of minimal
state intervention. But Hoover did act to contain
the effects of the onset of the depression. He
appealed to businessmen not to contract theiractivities and to maintain their workforce. Heappealed to the banks to extend credit. Besides
such exhortations, federal policies were limited –
though in the right direction. The nation should
help itself by enlightened voluntary cooperation
between the different interest groups. Prosperity‘lay just around the corner’.When the voluntary approach did not work,Hoover took more energetic steps to inﬂuence the
economy. He persuaded the bankers to establish a
National Credit Corporation in October 1931;the strong banks were to assist the weak and fail-ing ones. But banks, in their thousands, continued
to close their doors. Business conﬁdence was not
restored. In 1931 Hoover belatedly halted inter-
national ﬁnancial chaos for a time by calling for 
a year’s moratorium of Allied debts to the US;German reparations also ceased in practice.Hoover broke with his traditions by establishing
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932,
empowered to make loans to banks and ﬁnancial
institutions. That summer he accepted a con-
gressional bill to advance federal loans to individ-ual states to provide unemployment relief and
public works. The federal budget, despite his mis-
givings, allowed for more state expenditure than164THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
income. But the funds thus pumped into theeconomy were overshadowed by the stringent
credit policies followed by the banks, paradoxicallybecause they were better supervised and receivingﬁnancial support. The net result was that from
1929 to 1934 the American money supply con-
tracted by nearly a third, inevitably deepening the
depression and increasing unemployment.Roosevelt had no basic understanding of theoverall management of the economy and, in theelection campaign of 1932, attacked President
Hoover for his unbalanced budgets, promising as
one of his remedies for the depression to cut
federal spending by a quarter! Roosevelt’s electri-fying inaugural address of 4 March 1933 revealsthe other, psychological side of his mixture of
ideas together making up the promised NewDeal. He cautioned against unnecessary fear,attacked the ‘unscrupulous money changers’ and
vigorously promised action: ‘our greatest primarytask is to put people to work’. He was now deter-mined to put into practice what a year earlier he
had called ‘bold persistent experimentation’. If
something fails, he declared, admit it frankly and
try something else, but ‘above all try something.
The millions who are in want will not stand bysilently forever while the things to satisfy theirneeds are within easy reach.’Roosevelt spoke to the ordinary people andthey were at last convinced that the new president
was not prepared to capitulate to seeminglyuncontrollable economic forces, to the inexor-able workings of the business cycle. Roosevelt
exuded conﬁdence, charm and sincerity. There1THE DEPRESSION, 1929–39165

could be triumphantly overcome. Quite possibly
one consequence of his serious disability was that
he developed a new homely touch in politics, acharisma in the eyes of the mass of the people thatbecame an invaluable asset to him. The pampered
child of wealthy Americans, privately educated at
the best schools and at Harvard, Roosevelt bore
a famous family name. He modelled himself on
his famous relative Theodore.His early political career advanced by easy pro-gression from the Senate of the state of New
York, to a junior place in the Navy Department
in Wilson’s administration. Then to the gover-
norship of New York State when already strickenwith polio. The Republicans seemed firmly inpower in the 1920s, but the depression gave the
Democrats their chance and Roosevelt secured
the nomination in 1932. Roosevelt was happiest
when active. During the ﬁrst Hundred Days ofhis own administration he initiated measure aftermeasure, backed by a bevy of academics and
politicians who served as his think-tank, or brains
trust as it was then called. One associate who
knew him well described Roosevelt’s mind as ‘ﬂy-
paper’. There was a tremendous array of NewDeal policies, Washington became the centre andsource of new federal powers hitherto undreamt
of, and a vast sprawling bureaucracy administered
the programmes. The public’s thirst for action
was satisﬁed. This thirst was also slaked by thetwenty-ﬁrst amendment in February 1933, rati-ﬁed by the States in December. It was the end of
Prohibition. ‘Happy Days are here again.’An emergency banking act restored conﬁdencein the banks and in June 1933 deposits were
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance. In May1933 the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)tried to raise farm prices by paying federal subsi-
dies to farmers for reducing production; market-
ing agreements were supervised by the federal
authorities. In June 1933 the National IndustrialRecovery Act (NIRA) created corporate commit-tees representing the public, management and
labour to establish codes on production, prices
and competition. Labour was aided by the layingdown of maximum hours and minimum wagesand by being conceded the right to join a tradeunion, which at last gave a great impetus to 
the unionisation of the less skilled workers.
Underlying NIRA was a belief in national plan-
ning. But the biggest businesses dominated thecodes, as government supervision was small.Among the most celebrated early measures wasthe creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority
(TVA) in May 1933, which established govern-
ment authority over a vast impoverished region
containing a hydroelectric dam and fertiliser fac-tories. The Authority promoted scientiﬁc agricul-ture, prevented ﬂooding and engaged in a variety
of social programmes to aid the poor. Another
part of the NIRA established the Public Works
Administration with a fund of $3.3 billion. Underthe secretary of the interior, Harold Ickes, it wasset up to promote construction that was in 
the public interest, and employed during its ﬁrst
year 1 million men. But Ickes was cautious in his
approach; not so ex-social worker Harry Hopkins.Hopkins worked for speedy aid to restore themorale of the unemployed. The Civilian Works
Administration run by the indefatigable Hopkins
employed 4 million people on public works
schemes and cost $2,000 million in 1933 to
1934. Roosevelt thought this was too much andabolished it in the spring of 1934. His own pro-gramme in 1933 was the Civilian Conservation
Corps, which offered American unemployed
young men from the cities work in army-style
camps in the countryside. Over a thousand campsaccommodated 300,000 men planting trees andworking in rural areas. Other New Deal measures
sought to supervise and regulate Stock Exchange
dealings and ﬁnanciers.The work of many minds, the New Deal meas-
ures were not intended to introduce ‘socialism’.Roosevelt attempted to make capitalism work bet-
ter, to use the power of representative democratic
government to secure social justice for all the
people. Despite the measures comprising the New
Deal, the US’s unemployment ﬁgures disappoint-
ingly showed only gradual improvement. The rea-
son for this is not now difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Congress

and the president in 1933 and in 1934 were not
prepared to tolerate large deﬁcit budgets. Funds
166THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
spent on the programmes of the New Deal werebalanced by savings secured by reducing veterans’allowances, curtailing unemployment reliefs and
discharging government employees. What one
hand gave, the other took away, and federal deﬁcits

increased only gently in 1933 and 1934. The fed-
eral government had played a larger role andRoosevelt was genuinely responsive to the needs of
the poor; but in the end practical achievements,
when seen against the vastness of the problem,
proved insufﬁcient to ‘cure’ unemployment.The New Deal policies ran into trouble in1935. While the congressional elections of 1934had strengthened the reformers, the Supreme
Court took a conservative view of constitutional
rights. In May 1935 the Court invalidated the
NIRA as an unconstitutional delegation of powerand regulation of business. Roosevelt’s adminis-tration was already moving towards changes in
the New Deal and so did not attempt to re-
enact any parts of the NIRA. The attempt to
cooperate with business had not led to theexpected beneﬁcial results. The New Deal legisla-tion of 1935 to 1936 sought to reform business
practices and to destroy concentrations of busi-
ness power. Another important decision was 
to create many more jobs – ‘work relief’ – by
setting up the Works Progress Administrationunder Harry Hopkins and providing it with large funds; $1.47 billion on average in a full 
year (1936–40). Besides public works, Hopkins
created projects for out-of-work artists and
writers. The latter collected information andwrote guide books. Many suddenly discovered anew vocation for writing. Nearly 1.5 million pro-
jects were set up which, at different periods of
time, employed a total of more than 8.5 million
people during its years of operation. Even so, 
all these programmes absorbed only one-third ofthe unemployed.One of the most signiﬁcant reforms of theNew Deal era was the introduction – belated in
comparison to other Western nations – of basic
welfare policies such as old-age pensions. Thepassage of the Social Security Act in August 1935, inspired by the efforts of Frances Perkins,
provided – besides federal old-age pensions –
unemployment insurance and help to the lessprivileged. Many of the poorest sections ofAmerican society were still excluded, but the Actmarked a beginning on which later expansion
could be built. The growth of labour unions and
recognition of their rights by the National Labor
Relations Act (Wagner Act) further limited busi-ness power. All in all, the New Deal had redis-tributed power in the community and greatly
increased that of the federal government.In November 1936 Roosevelt was re-electedto a second term by a bigger victory than in 1932,
gaining 61 per cent of the popular vote. He rep-
resented the non-revolutionary change the major-
ity of voters wished to see. His biggest personal
political setback occurred soon after the election,
when he attempted to change the composition of
the Supreme Court, which threatened his New
Deal legislation. He requested Congress to legis-
late that the Supreme Court could be enlarged bythe president appointing an additional supple-
mentary justice for every existing justice over the
age of seventy who did not wish to retire. But
Congress refused to tamper with the Court in this
way. Nevertheless, Roosevelt’s complaints of the
Court’s unresponsiveness to social needs seems to
have produced a change of attitude; the Court
ceased to be the conservative obstacle to New
Deal legislation after 1936. In any case, gradually
Roosevelt’s nominees came to predominate as the
older judges retired.That the New Deal was not even larger inscope was not so much due to the attacks of its
opponents as to the policies of the administration
itself. Roosevelt never could abandon his belief in
a ‘sound money’ policy. He favoured keeping
spending within well-controlled limits. A reces-
sion in 1937 was followed by a slow recovery but,even in 1940, 15 per cent of the workforceremained jobless. Yet, America in 1940 was very
different from when Roosevelt ﬁrst entered the
White House. He had sought reform and change,
but not a revolution of the capitalist system. His
bold approach, his faith in democracy and his
desire to help the ordinary people, the disadvan-
taged and the poor, not only brought hope where
there had been despair but also significantly
changed American society and attitudes.1THE DEPRESSION, 1929–39167
The Soviet leadership, after the departure in 1922 of the Japanese, the last foreign troops 
on Soviet territory, was able to fashion and create
Soviet society free from outside interference. TheAllies had withdrawn. The Whites were defeated.Bolshevik armies had established control over the
Caucasus region, central Asia and the whole of
Siberia during 1920 and 1921. With the end of
the civil war, and Russia’s own foreign war with
Poland – ﬁghting stopped in October 1920 – notonly was Soviet revolutionary power established,but for two decades, until Hitler’s invasion of
1941, the expected concerted capitalist attack did
not materialise. It never in fact materialised as the
Soviet Union eventually fought Germany inalliance with capitalist Britain and the US. But thefear that the half-hearted Allied intervention
immediately after the revolution was not the end
but the precursor of an attempt by the capitalist
world to liquidate the first communist state
powerfully inﬂuenced the Soviet Union’s foreignrelations.To preserve Soviet power every weaponappeared to be justiﬁable. Britain and the West
were to be weakened by pursuit of a vigorous
anti-imperialist policy in Asia and the MiddleEast. Western communist parties, members of theComintern (the First Congress of the Third
International was convened by Lenin in Moscow
in March 1919) were to join the struggle for the
survival of the Soviet Union, however much sucha policy might conflict with a purely nationalinterest. Simultaneously, foreign relations withthe West were conducted so as to exploit divisions
between them. Arrangements for mutual military
and technical aid were developed with WeimarGermany after the signature of the Treaty ofRapallo in April 1922. Such a policy was com-
bined with the apparently contradictory support
for the German Communist Party’s attacks on the
‘social fascists’ which contributed to the fall of
Weimar and the coming to power of the Nazis.Even when the German communists became theﬁrst victims of Nazi violence, they held to the
doctrinal correctness of the analysis that the over-
throw of bourgeois socialists had brought the
communist revolution a step closer.The imminent danger of foreign interventionwas thus as much an illusion of the Soviet leaders
in the 1920s as the expectation of communist rev-
olution spreading in the West which, as late as
1921, the Soviet leadership still believed was the
only hope of Russia’s survival. But, for anyone liv-ing in Russia in the winter of 1920–1, there couldbe no illusion about the country’s virtually total
collapse after six years of war and civil war. Then a
new disaster struck: in the summer of 1921 the
grain crop failed. Added to the millions killed inwar, countless more millions now died of starva-tion and disease. This time the West ‘intervened’
in a humanitarian mission of relief. In March
1921, even before the actual famine, Lenin told
the Tenth Congress of the Communist Party: ‘Weare living in such conditions of impoverishmentChapter 16SOVIET RUSSIA‘COMMUNISM IN TRANSITION’and ruin that for a time everything must be sub-ordinated to this fundamental consideration – at all costs to increase the quantity of goods ...’

Principal among these goods were food and med-
icine. The aid of Hoover’s American Relief
Administration was, therefore, later accepted. Yet,all such efforts had only a limited effect in the faceof the scale of the disaster. No understanding of
the early years of Soviet rule is possible without an
appreciation of the suffering of the Russian peo-
ple amid mounting chaos such as had not
occurred in the history of Europe in moderntimes. Foreign military intervention, albeit half-hearted, contributed to the general breakdown.Lenin, whose authority towered above that ofhis frequently arguing lieutenants, heading a
Communist Party which at ﬁrst was only small,sought to establish some sort of stable basis onwhich communism could be built. Between 1919
and 1922 the Bolshevik Party became a mass
movement of 700,000 members, by no means all
of whom were still revolutionary. In Lenin’s poli-cies there was little consistency – they were morereactions to successive emergencies. During the
civil war the Red Army of 5 million men as well
as the workers in the cities had to be fed. The
term ‘war-communism’ is used to describe the
measures taken during the years from July 1918to 1921, which were as extreme as was the situ-ation facing Lenin. A Supreme Council of
National Economy had already been created in
December 1917 to take over such industry and
ﬁnance as it considered necessary and to plan cen-trally the Soviet economy. After June 1918,industrial enterprises were rapidly nationalised
and workers and managers subjected to rigid
control. As money became virtually valueless with
the collapse of the economy, theorists saw one
advantage in the misfortune: communism mightbe attained not gradually but in one leap; stateindustries could now be ‘purely’ planned – the
money economy abolished and with it all private
enterprise and trade.The key problem of the war-communist periodwas how to secure food from the peasants, whosealliance with the urban proletariat Lenin had
declared to be essential to the success of the rev-
olution. The value of money had been reduced toalmost nothing; the factories were not producinggoods that could be bartered. The peasants obsti-nately clung to the ownership of their land and
refused to join state farms. Lenin at first
attempted to divide the peasants, the poor from
the better off – the kulaks, or exploiters, as theywere called. This no doubt succeeded in spread-ing hatred in the villages but it did not yield grain.
Then he wooed the so-called ‘middle peasants’ –
the supposedly less poor (these categorisations
corresponded to policy tactics rather than reali-
ties: only one in a hundred peasant householdsemployed more than one labourer). Force wasapplied since the state could give nothing to the
peasants in exchange for what were deﬁned as
‘surpluses’. With the utmost ruthlessness, detach-
ments were sent into the countryside to seizefood. Peasants were shot for resisting expropria-tion. Villages were searched, peasants left desti-
tute. Bolshevik punitive expeditions attempted to
overcome peasant resistance and violence. The
excesses of war-communism were encouraged byLenin. The only answer he could ﬁnd as the crisisdeepened in early 1920 was even more ruthless
pressure on the peasants. Those who were
accused of retaining food were condemned as
‘enemies of the people’. The civil war, above all,
and the policies of war-communism resultingfrom it, led, however, to the total collapse of whatremained of the Russian agricultural and indus-
trial economy. Transport had broken down and
there was a large exodus from the starving towns
and idle factories back to the country.During his years of power, Lenin neverwavered from his insistence on the supreme
authority of the party and centralised control. No
sectional interest of workers or peasants organised
in the form of trade unions should act as a coun-
terpoise to the party. Power was to be retained bythe centre with iron discipline. In this he wasstrongly supported by Trotsky, who wished to
rebuild Russia by mobilising the people under
military discipline. Under the harsh realities of the
civil war and its aftermath Lenin had given up his earlier views that once the revolution had suc-ceeded the state would begin to wither away and
socialism would evolve by the spontaneous enthu-
siasm and work of the masses. He convinced1SOVIET RUSSIA169
himself that it was necessary to replace the revo-lution with a one-party state. But as he conceivedit there was ﬂexibility; especially after 1921 ‘non-
party’ specialists were encouraged. The bureau-
cracy was an inevitable outcome of the centralised
state, though it deeply worried Lenin during thelast months of his life. He began to alter coursein 1921–2 and simultaneously government em-
ployees were drastically reduced. It was also 
Lenin who urged the use of force and terror
where other means failed to achieve the desired
ends. However much he criticised the conse-
quences of the direction of state policy, the foun-dations of the Soviet state had been laid by Lenin.While it is true that Lenin permitted debatewithin and outside the higher echelon of the party
as in newspapers, men of the old guard, such asLev Kamenev, Grigori Zinoviev, Aleksei Rykov,Nikolai Bukharin and Leon Trotsky, who differed
on the right policies to be followed, ultimately
had to obey the party line once Lenin had reached
a decision. On the issue whether there could beany but a one-party state no debate was possible.The Tenth Party Congress, held in March 1921,
passed the resolution ‘On Party Unity’, which
though it did not stiﬂe all debate and criticism
forbade the formation within the party of any
political groups ‘with separate platforms, strivingto a certain degree to segregate and create theirown group discipline’ and then to publish views
not authorised by the party. The infamous
Paragraph Seven of this resolution empowered
the Central Committee by two-thirds majority toexpel from the party members of the CentralCommittee who diverged, and so to banish them
into political exile. The weapon for stiﬂing any
dissident view not favouring the leader or group
of leaders in power had been forged. Stalin later
made full use of it to eliminate anyone he choseto accuse of factionalism.In March 1921, simultaneously with the reso-lution on party unity, came the about-turn of
Lenin’s policy – the inauguration of the slogan
New Economic Policy (NEP), coined to cover thedramatic reversal. The conviction that ever-increasing ruthlessness, especially in extracting
food from the peasantry, was threatening the
whole country’s coherence must have been takingshape for some time. It was a mutiny of the sailorsin the fortress of Kronstadt early in March 1921,bloodily repressed, which Lenin claimed ‘was the
ﬂash which lit up reality better than anything
else’. But the decision had already been taken by
him following peasant riots and workers’ strikesin the previous months.The NEP began when the Tenth Party Con-gress passed a resolution replacing the seizure of
surplus food with a less onerous and a properly
regulated ‘tax in kind’. Any further surplus the
peasant could market freely. Three years later in1924 the tax in kind became a money payment.Free trading and, with it, a money economy
revived. Small-scale production by not more than
twenty workers was allowed once again. Large
industries continued under state ownership withfew exceptions. The vast majority of productionwas by state enterprises or by individual artisans.
Between 1921 and 1926, the mixed industrial
economy, part private part state, recovered so 
that by 1926 the level of production of 1913 hadbeen reached. In agriculture, individual peasantsfarmed more than 98 per cent of the land sown.
Agriculture recovered from the low levels of 1921
and 1922, but the amount left over from peasant
consumption was less than in 1913; yet the need
for grain to feed the expanding urban popula-tion and for export to provide capital grew muchfaster than the traditional peasant agriculture sup-
plied. Nor were the peasants imbued with enthu-
siasm for socialism despite attempts to arouse a
sense of common solidarity against the better-offpeasants, the kulaks. A peasant farming his landtraditionally, and encouraged to improve his stan-
dard of living by having stimulated in him a desire
for proﬁt, was not likely to accept the ideals of
communism. The more successful a peasant, the
less socialist he became. NEP on the land helpedto save Russia from starvation, but did notprovide the surplus to allow the economy to
advance rapidly.A complementary element of the more liberaleconomic approach of NEP in the 1920s was thetightening of party discipline and centralism.Cultural concessions, for instance, were made to
the non-Russian nationalities, but not at the
expense of centralised party and military control.170THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
The Tenth Party Congress of March 1921, whichsaw the beginnings of NEP, also, as has beennoted, passed the resolutions against factions
within the party. The swollen Communist Party
itself was purged of some 200,000 members con-
sidered unreliable to the Bolshevik ideals. Leninwarned that the revolutionary old guard musthold together through all the transitional phases
of communism, even those like NEP which
marked a retreat from socialist objectives. How
temporary would the retreat have to be? That was
a fundamental and contentious issue. As long asLenin remained the indisputable leader, howevermuch debate and individual criticism took place
within the party, great changes of policy were still
possible without destroying the cohesion of the
party or without producing a savage ﬁght, liter-ally to the death, between Lenin’s lieutenants.Lenin’s own premature death so early in the for-
mation of the state was therefore of enormous
signiﬁcance.The struggles of the revolution and war hadsapped Lenin’s strength. Towards the end of1921 he fell seriously ill. In May 1922 at the age
of ﬁfty-two he suffered a serious stroke which
paralysed his right side. By October he had recov-
ered sufﬁciently to resume a partial workload. In
December 1922 his health again deteriorated andon 21 January 1924 he died. Of particular inter-est during his last weeks of active work from the
end of 1922 to 4 January 1923 are the notes he
dictated which together comprise what was called
his ‘testament’. In these memoranda he stressedthe need to strengthen the unity of the CentralParty Committee, and characterised the strengths
and weaknesses of six leading members of the
party. The characterisation of Stalin, ‘who having
become the General Secretary has accumulated
enormous power in his hands and I am not surewhether he will be able to use this power withdue care’, was especially important in view of the
question who should succeed Lenin. During his
illness he was outraged by Stalin’s attempt to cut
him off from inﬂuence in January 1923, a yearbefore his death. He urged Stalin’s dismissal andreplacement by a new general secretary ‘more tol-
erant, more loyal and less capricious’. It was too
late. Lenin was too ill to act as unquestionedleader any longer. He had also criticised Trotsky,though describing him as the other leading per-sonality of the party, for ‘his too far-reaching self-
conﬁdence’ and as too much attracted to pure
administration. What was the purpose of this
critical testament? Lenin was preoccupied by whatwould happen after his death. He concluded thatno single one of the Bolshevik leadership could
be designated as his successor. By his frank criti-
cisms of all his lieutenants he was arguing for his
own solution to the succession. This was to
increase the Central Committee to ﬁfty, even ahundred persons, by adding industrial workersand peasants close to the feeling of the rank and
ﬁle of the party and for this body to control and
supervise the collective leadership.Following Lenin’s death no stable collective lead-ership took over. Stalin, who had been appointed
general secretary with Lenin’s support in 1922 to
bring order to the organisation of the party, trans-
formed this important but secondary positioninto a vehicle for the advancement of his personalpower. His work for the party before this eleva-
tion had shown him to be ruthless and a good
organiser. To these qualities he added cunning
and a sense of timing in political intrigue. Using
his powers to the full, he promoted to key postsmen who would follow him, and strengthened hisposition further by removing others who sup-

ported rivals. Among the old guard, Trotsky was
widely disliked for his arrogance, intellectual bril-
liance and showmanship. Stalin aligned himselfwith Zinoviev to undermine Trotsky’s inﬂuence.In a little more than ﬁve years, he had ousted all
the prominent former leadership. But he was not
Lenin’s undisputed heir; nor did he enjoy the
veneration granted to the late leader. Stalin
encouraged a Lenin cult. He then kept himself atthe top by the ruthless liquidation of all real andpotential rivals who might conceivably challenge
his control. Not until the end of the Great Terror
in 1938 did any challenge to Stalin’s supreme
control become unthinkable. Yet his paranoid fearof plots and conspiracies beset him to the end ofhis life.Lenin tolerated party discussion; Stalin couldnot stiﬂe it in the 1920s as the better-known,1SOVIET RUSSIA171
more prominent Soviet leaders still overshadowedhim. He supported a moderate internal economicpolicy, upheld NEP and identiﬁed himself with
Lenin’s policies after the latter’s death. Appealing
to party unity, while packing key positions with
his supporters, Stalin was ready to take on themost prestigious of the old Bolshevik leaders. Thebig quarrel with Trotsky occurred at the end of
1923 and early 1924 after Trotsky’s attacks on
the old guard. Trotsky was effectively defeated 
at the Thirteenth Party Congress in January 
1924. Together with Zinoviev, president of theComintern, whose power base was the Leningradparty, and Kamenev, chairman of the Moscow
Soviet, Stalin had already made himself the
leading member of the triumvirate controlling the
party, the key to controlling the country. Trotskyhad published a book, Lessons of October, in whichhe bitterly attacked the credentials of Zinoviev
and Kamenev, who had been ‘Right’ Bolsheviks
opposed to the October Revolution in 1917. 
In his denunciation Trotsky implied that suchshortcomings were responsible for the failure ofrevolution beyond the Soviet Union, for instance
in Germany. The triumvirate countered by stress-
ing the longstanding quarrel between Trotsky 
and Lenin about ‘permanent’ revolution, which
Trotsky had fervently advocated; and Stalin enun-ciated the slogan ‘socialism in one country’. Stalindeclared more realistically that the Soviet Union
had survived and claimed that the conditionsexisted in Russia for the complete construction of
socialism; this he saw as the primary task. Thepolicies of communists in other countries, too,were therefore expected in practice to make this
their primary objective, subordinating national
considerations to the strengthening of the Soviet
Union.Trotsky and Stalin were not so far apart as theirpolemics made it appear. At moments of greatdanger, such as the Soviet leaders believed existed
in 1927 and 1928, Trotsky was just as ready as
Stalin to place the safety of the Soviet Union ﬁrst.
In this respect they were both heirs of Lenin’sRealpolitik. In the power struggle in the topechelon of the party, Stalin calculated that a mod-
erate line would be the most successful, while
Trotsky assumed the mantle of the ardent,unquenchable revolutionary and the champion of‘democracy’ within the party. The genuineness ofTrotsky’s democratic sentiments was never tested,
for he never wielded supreme power. He was cer-
tainly no less ruthless than Stalin in his readiness
to subordinate means to an end. But Stalin’scontrol of the party machine secured Trotsky’sgradual elimination. In January 1925 Trotsky lost
the argument of his Lessons of October and theCentral Committee deprived him of his nominal
leadership of the Red Army.Stalin now pushed from key control two othermembers of the Politburo, his fellow triumvi-rates, Kamenev and Zinoviev. Instead he allied
with those who fully backed the NEP, Nikolai
Bukharin, a longstanding companion of Lenin and
editor of Pravda, and two other Politburo mem-bers, Aleksei Rykov and Mikhail Tomsky. ButTrotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev still retained their
places on the Politburo, at least until 1926. That
year the three men, calling themselves the United
Opposition, mounted attacks on Comrade Stalin’scapacity to unite the party and on the economicstate of the country and bureaucracy. Stalin
expelled all three from the Politburo and purged
their supporters. Trotsky’s further attacks on
Stalin, and the organisation of an open demon-
stration against the leadership in November 1927led to his and Zinoviev’s and many of theirfollowers’ exclusion from the party in December
1927. A year later Trotsky was expelled from
Russia.Two years later it was the turn of the ‘right’opposition. Bukharin lost control of the Com-intern at the end of 1928, and in 1929 and 1930
Tomsky and Rykov were replaced. All eventually
died violently, victims of Stalin’s purges of the
mid-1930s. But it is simplistic to reduce the
struggles at the centre of power to Stalin’s com-pletely cynical manoeuvrings to reach the top.Three deep concerns formed just a part of the
immense nexus of problems associated with ‘com-
munism in transition’: transforming a predomin-
antly peasant society into an industrial powercapable of catching up with the capitalist West,while keeping the goal of a communist society in
view; at the same time the leadership was anx-
iously scanning the international horizon for an172THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
impending attack by the capitalist nations; just asdisastrous was the possibility that their own impe-rialist rivalry would start a second world war
involving Russia in the maelstrom. Any one
problem was, in itself, gigantic; together they
were truly bafﬂing. And there were no models tofollow. Marxism was based on revolution in anadvanced industrial nation, not an overwhelm-
ingly peasant society. Lenin, when confronted
with practical problems, had made bewildering
changes of policy, justifying each with fresh doc-
trinal pronouncements. The mark of the domin-ant leader was his capacity radically to changepolicy and retainpower. After Lenin, only Stalinas it turned out could do that. But this does not
mean that he changed policy merely for the sake
of discrediting his rivals or that he had plotted inadvance ﬁrst a policy to the ‘right’ and then tothe ‘left’.Stalin’s own uncertainty about his ability tohold on to supreme power in the face of the poli-
cies he felt it necessary to pursue is, indeed, thebasic explanation of his murderous purges of the1930s. He linked the survival of the communist
regime with his own survival as undisputed leader.
He wanted to be regarded as infallible; for proof
he presented an unending stream of wrongdoers
who, in public trials, confessed their errors andwere shot. Their confessions to foreign conspira-cies were intended to underline the mortal
dangers to which the Soviet Union was exposed,
but saved from by Stalin’s vigilance. At the same
time an understanding of Soviet policies is notpossible without the assumption that there weredeep and genuine problems, that more than one
plausible option of action presented itself; and
even granted that Stalin never lost sight of his
tenure of power and would stop at nothing to
maintain it, he was also concerned to discover theright policy to follow.Stalin had reached the leadership groupthrough Lenin’s own selection and Lenin had an
eye for remarkable men to act as the founding
members of the new state. Unlike Lenin and therest of the Bolshevik leadership, Stalin spent theyears of preparation not in comfortable and
argumentative exile, but in Russia, in constant
danger and engaged in organising the party whennot in tsarist prison or Siberian exile. In Stalin,the cobbler’s son born in Georgia in December1879, Lenin saw a hardened, totally dedicated
revolutionary leader, painstaking, and an effective
organiser. Stalin showed a total disregard for
‘conventions’ of the law and civil rights when theyimpeded what he deemed necessary. As a youngrevolutionary in tsarist days he was lawless in a
cause; in power he became lawless without
restraint, ﬁlling the prisons, the places of execu-
tion and the labour camps in the 1930s and later
with millions of people innocent of any crimeexcept to arouse Stalin’s suspicions. The appar-ently benign, modest and down-to-earth leader –
it was easy for the Stalin cult to portray him as
the father of his people just as the tsars before him
had been – had turned into a monstrous tyrant.Stalin was a consummate actor who could hide histrue nature and, if he chose, charm those who had
dealings with him, just as he was to charm
Churchill and Roosevelt when the three leadersmet during the Second World War. He was capable of carefully weighing alternatives, of cal-
culating the risks and proceeding rationally, 
of outwitting his enemies at home and abroad.
Secretive, suspicious, malevolent and lacking
Lenin’s intellect, he made himself into Lenin’sheir and saw himself as such. His crimes wereimmense. His mistakes brought the whole country
close to catastrophe in 1930 and in 1941, yet both
he and the Soviet Union survived. During the
Stalin era, there occurred the decisive shift thatwas to propel the Soviet Union from being a back-ward country to a state capable of grinding down
and, during the latter part of the Second World
War, overwhelming Germany. He achieved the
industrial and military transformation of Russia,
the creation of tens of thousands of technicallyproficient men, of administrators and doctorsfrom a backward peasant society. The other
legacy: millions of dead, victims of collectivisation,
deportation and the Gulags.That the New Economic Policy had to be a‘transitional’ phase in the construction of com-munism was obvious, unless communism itself
was to abandon its Marxist goals. NEP had
brought about an amazing recovery but was it1SOVIET RUSSIA173
capable of continuing at its previous pace ofgrowth, after the ﬁrst ﬁve years, given the lowbase from which it had started? Would the Soviet
Union not merely catch up with tsarist pre-war
production but decisively move beyond it? Then
how could NEP enable the Soviet Union toacquire the sinews of the modern industrial statewith an iron and steel industry, machinery and
armaments, improved transportation and ade-
quate power? A vast network of electric power
stations was one of Lenin’s pet dreams. With a
‘mixed’ economy would too many resources beswallowed up in providing the consumer withtheir needs rather than investing for the future?
Had the essentially tsarist agricultural methods
reached the limit of their productive capacity? On
purely economic grounds, leaving aside ideologi-cal considerations, there were powerful argumentsfor a change of policy at the point when NEP
failed to provide for the economic growth desired
by the Bolshevik leadership.During the winter of 1927 and 1928 the peas-ants reacted to increased taxes, low ofﬁcial prices,threats against the offence of hoarding and simply
a lack of goods to buy by hanging on to their
grain. Industrial investment had already speeded
up industrialisation, the ‘selﬁshness’ and ‘petty-
bourgeois’ behaviour of the kulaks, in Stalin’sjudgement, threatened the whole economy.Violence against the peasant to extract the grain
needed to feed the towns was again resorted to
in ‘emergency’ measures. The peasantry from rich
to poor were hard hit in 1928 and alienated fromthe Soviet regime, though it was obviously thekulaks and better-off peasants who had most grain
and so suffered the most. After the summer of
1928 Stalin faced the prospect of annual crises to
purchase sufﬁcient grain unless some fundamen-
tal changes were effected in dealing with the peas-antry and agricultural productivity. Stalin hadlittle love for the Russian peasantry, which he
believed was holding the country to ransom.Industrial expansion was jeopardised by thecrisis in agriculture. If the peasantry were to beappeased, more goods would need to be releasedfor their consumption. This was in contradiction
to a policy of catching up rapidly with the
advanced capitalist countries. No Soviet leaderever lost sight of Russia’s comparative weakness,which was believed to offer a temptation to thecapitalist nations to attack it. The more relaxed
attitudes of the mid-1920s, which also affected
foreign policy – the slogan here used to describe
Soviet aims was ‘peaceful coexistence’ – came toan end in 1927 and 1928. The Soviet leadershipwas beset by acute new fears that some concerted
onslaught on the Soviet Union was imminent.
The Soviet policy in China of supporting the
nationalist revolution of Chiang Kai-shek had col-
lapsed when Chiang turned on his former com-munist partners. Relations with Britain haddeteriorated, and Britain, France and Poland were
credited with plans to launch an offensive against
the Soviet Union. There was a sense that the
breathing space in Europe and the Far East couldbe short. The worldwide depression added a newelement of uncertainty.We have little indication of Stalin’s thinkingduring this or any other period. One can plausibly
surmise that in 1928 and 1929 he was still muchconcerned with rivals and criticisms of his policiesand economic developments, which were certainly
not going well. The problem of the change of
course of the economic and social policies of the
Soviet state has been debated by historians and we
may never be able to fathom what perceptions and plans were Stalin’s at any precise moment.Certainly a vociferous group of his supporters was
calling for rapid industrialisation and Stalin leant
on them in his struggle with opponents of the pol-
icy. At what point in particular did he regard NEPas an obstacle to be cleared away if the pace ofRussian industrialisation and its direction were to
conform to his own objectives? If industrialisation
were to be pushed ahead rapidly, the necessary
investment would not signiﬁcantly come from for-
eign loans, or even signiﬁcantly from exports ofgrain, but from the higher productivity of workersand peasants and a holding back of consumption
by them. In plain English, the industrial advance
was achieved at the sacriﬁce of their own living
standards, the work being rewarded with only lowreal wages. Long-term state planning by the StatePlanning Commission was certainly well under
way and resources were increasingly transferred 
to large-scale industrial projects. By 1926 the174THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
increasing shortages of goods led to multi-pricingof the same goods in ‘commercial’ shops or at arti-
ﬁcially low prices but strictly rationed. Despite
rises in wages the actual cost of living rose much
more steeply. By 1933 living standards had
declined precipitously. While there was none ofthe unemployment that plagued Western econ-omies at the time, the great industrial leap forward
was accompanied by mass misery and hunger.A ‘maximum’ version of the First Five-YearPlan was adopted by the Sixteenth Party Congress
in 1929. Industrial output was intended toincrease more than twofold and agriculturaloutput to rise by half. The industrial growth actu-
ally achieved fell far short of such unrealisable
targets. In trying to fulﬁl them there was huge
waste and confusion. Coercion and regulationwere necessary means to drive industrialisationforward especially in the primitive regions of
Russia, the Urals and Siberia, where for military
strategic reasons new industrial complexes were
set up. The emphasis was on heavy industry, ironand steel, and machinery. The First Five-YearPlan, declared to be fulﬁlled a year in advance,
actually fell short of its target in most industrial
sections. But great iron and steel works were
being constructed, the gigantic Dnieper dam was
built and the engineering industry greatlyexpanded. The basis of a modern industry hadbeen constructed.The Second Five-Year Plan (1933–7) broughtimprovements for the Russian people. The eco-
nomic sacriﬁces demanded of the people were notas harsh and there was greater emphasis on pro-ducing goods for consumption. Planning becamemore efﬁcient and a greater self-sufﬁciency wasachieved. After 1937 the massive switch to armsproduction once more created new bottlenecks
and shortages. Control over the labour force
became much harsher. Workers were tied in 1940
to their place of work and absenteeism became acrime. Industrially the Soviet Union, in a decadeand a half, had been transformed and proved
strong enough to withstand the shock of the
German invasion. Statistics should always be con-
sidered with caution and this is especially true of
Soviet statistics. But the ﬁgures shown in the tableindicate and reﬂect the change of Soviet Russia’sindustry. Whether Soviet statistics are to be relied
on is an open question.The results were in any case impressive, thehuman cost equally enormous. Enthusiasm forbuilding socialism was replaced by terror andcoercion. Ideals of socialist equality did not
inhibit Stalin from decreeing differential rewards.
With much stick, and the carrot of high rewards
for successful skilled piecework, he drove the mass of new peasant workers in industry to pullRussia out of the morass. Socialism could not be
built in a society predominantly peasant and back-
ward, Stalin believed. Nor could a backward
Soviet Union survive, surrounded as it was by
enemies. But the arbitrary murderous excesses ofStalin’s rule in the 1930s bear no relation to theachievement of such goals. On the contrary, they
gravely jeopardised progress. In dealing with the
peasantry and agriculture his policies led to disas-
ter. Here, the ‘revolution from above’ not onlyinﬂicted enormous hardship on the majority ofthe population, the peasantry, but also failed in1SOVIET RUSSIA175

its purpose to ‘modernise’ agriculture on a scalesimilar to industry.Stalin’s cure for Russia’s backward agriculturewas to transform the small, scattered peasant
holdings into large farms, collectively and coop-
eratively farmed. In theory this was sound. Inpractice, productivity slumped when the individ-ual peasant’s personal ownership of his lands and
his livestock was abolished. The peasants did not
voluntarily give up their land and join collective
farms. By 1928 less than three acres in a hundred
of sown land were cultivated by collective or statefarms. At the beginning of that year Stalin organ-ised from his own secretariat the forcible seizure
of grain as the peasants were unwilling to part
with it for the artiﬁcially low prices laid down. It
was a return to the methods of war-communism.Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky, once Stalin’s alliesagainst the Trotsky ‘left’, as has been seen,
attacked Stalin from May 1928 onwards when
they realised he intended to continue the emer-
gency measures. Bukharin, in particular, con-
demned Stalin’s dictatorial pretensions, declaring:‘We stand by the principle of collective action and
refuse to accept the principle of control by a
single individual, no matter how great his author-
ity.’ Stalin countered by savagely attacking
Bukharin as a right-wing deviationist. BetweenFebruary and July 1929 the political standing ofthe three leaders was progressively undermined
and the expulsion from the Politburo of Tomsky
and Bukharin in November 1929 marked the
elimination of their opposition to Stalin’s indus-trial and agricultural plans. (Rykov retained hismembership of the Politburo until 1930.)From the summer of 1929 Stalin issued partydirectives to secure more grain for state purchase
at low prices. The kulaks were singled out as the
most prosperous and therefore pressure on themwould, it was thought, yield a good return. Notonly their grain but their farms too began to be
seized. NEP was breaking up. On 7 November
1929 Stalin signalled the drive for forcible col-
lectivisation at the greatest possible speed. Hecharacteristically declared that the middle peas-ants as well as the poor peasants had turned to
the collective farms. The continuing crisis caused
by the difﬁculty of getting grain was a crucialreason for the sudden urgency, but behindStalin’s assault also lay a long-felt suspicion ofpeasants as reliable allies of the urban proletariat.Between the Bolsheviks and the peasants therewas a large gap. The notion of petty-peasant pro-
prietorship simply did not ﬁt into the communist
model of the future classless society. Stalin saw
even the poorest peasant defending his possession
of land and animals as exhibiting the characteris-
tics of the ‘petty-capitalist class’. As long as the
landed peasant persisted in Russian society, Stalin
believed, a communist state would never be built.He may have calculated that by ruining the moreprosperous peasants, the kulaks, by deﬁning them
as a class to be destroyed, all the peasants would
be taught the lesson that successful private enter-
prise held no future for them. Certainly, party
leaders believed that they could stir up class war
between the poor peasant and the kulak and so
gain some peasant support. ‘Kulak’ was, more-
over, an entirely elastic deﬁnition and could be
extended to any peasant; those too obviously poor
could simply be labelled as kulak sympathisers.
Under the cover of the supposed kulak enemy,
land could be seized, peasants expelled and sent by
cattle trucks to Siberia, and the whole peasantrycould be terrorised. Without forcible measures toovercome the agricultural crisis, Stalin believed,
the acceleration of industrialisation would fail, and
one of his close supporters improbably claimed
that all industrial growth would come to a
standstill halfway through the Five-Year Plan if
industrialisation was not accelerated.Plans for the acceleration of industrial produc-tion went hand in hand with plans for the accel-

eration of collectivisation of the peasant farms.
From the summer of 1929 onwards the peasants
were being pressurised by party representatives in
the villages to join the collective farms. The peas-
ants reacted with suspicion or outright hostility.By October 1929 collectives were farming almostone acre in eleven of sown land. Meanwhile,
forcible procurement of grain by party task forces
over the whole country was securing results. In
the autumn of 1929 Stalin, supported by
Molotov and Kaganovich, determined to break all
resistance to a great leap forward and to the mass176THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
discontent that coercion in the procurement ofgrain was producing.It was in part wishful thinking and in part acommand that collectivisation was to be quickly
achieved regardless of what resistance remained.
In December 1929 mass ‘dekulakisation’ began.
Stalin decreed their ‘elimination as a class’.Elimination of the individual peasant deﬁned askulak did not yet mean death, except in the case
of those categorised as the most active counter-
revolutionaries, but meant the conﬁscation of his
property and imprisonment or the deportation ofthe whole family to Siberia, where with a fewtools they began to farm again. Some kulaks were
allowed to remain in their locality and were inte-
grated into the collective system. The whole pro-
gramme was carried through with the utmost
violence and barbarity; 6 million peasants werethe victims. Many perished through deprivationor suicide. The miseries of the depression do not
compare with the human disaster that unfolded
in Stalin’s Russia.The result in the countryside was chaos. Morethan half the peasant farmers had been collec-tivised by the spring of 1930. As the time 
for spring sowing approached, reports from the
countryside came back to Moscow that the for-
cible collectivisation was preparing the way for 
an unparalleled disaster. There was much peasantresistance, including uprisings. The new collec-tives were unlikely to produce a fraction of the
food produced by the individual peasants before
collectivisation. Stalin, faced with disastrous
failure, compromised. In the face of so great afailure, his own standing could be jeopardised. Hepublished an article, ‘Dizzy with Success’. Local
party workers were blamed for the excesses; coer-
cion was wrong; those peasants who wished to
leave the collective farms could do so. But insteadof the expected few there was a mass exodus;more than half the peasants left the collectives 
and took back some of their land to farm. The
collective farmers retained the best land.To counter this unexpected turn of events,Stalin in the summer of 1930 ordered a resump-tion of forcible collectivisation. There was no let-up this time. By 1935, 94 per cent of the crop
area of land was collectivised. The results in pro-ductivity were appalling. The peasants slaughteredtheir animals; the collectives were inefﬁcient; theyield of crops dropped and party purges and coer-
cion could not relieve the food shortages. The
conditions of the early 1930s revived the experi-
ences of the early 1920s. There were widespreadfamines and millions perished. The situationwould have been even worse if Stalin had not
learnt one lesson from the winter of 1929–30 and
the widespread peasant violence and resistance to
collectivisation. The collectivised peasants were
permitted small plots and to own a few animalsfrom 1930 onwards. After 1932 they were evenallowed to sell food privately over and above the
quota to be delivered to the state at state prices.
The private peasant plot became an important
element in the supply of milk and meat. Agri-culture recovered slowly from the onslaught, butthere was no leap forward as occurred in the
industrial sector. The pre-1928 levels were only
just attained again, though the population had
grown in the meantime. Economically Stalin’scollectivisation did not solve Russia’s need forgrowth of agricultural production before the
German invasion in 1941 dealt a devastating
blow. Even Stalin had to compromise with the
peasantry in allowing some private production
and sale, or face the prospect of permanentconditions of famine.The enormous tensions created by Stalin’sindustrial and agricultural policies from 1929 to
1934 were accompanied by a policy of terrorisation
to thwart any possible opposition. Propagandasought to raise Stalin to the public status of a demi-god, the arbiter of every activity of society – art, lit-

erature, music, education, Marxist philosophy.
Terror tactics were not new under Soviet rule.
Show trials, which turned those who were con-

structing the new Russia into scapegoats for fail-
ures, had begun in 1928. It appears that Stalin’spower was not absolute between 1928 and 1934
and that the failures, especially in agriculture, were
weakening his position. Perhaps a straw in the
wind was the curious fact that the SeventeenthParty Congress early in 1934 changed his titlefrom that of ‘general secretary’ to just ‘secretary’ 
of the party. Was this a rebuke against his attempt
to gather all power in his hands? Was the leader of1SOVIET RUSSIA177
the Leningrad party, Sergei Kirov, who was also amember of the Politburo and hitherto a Stalin sup-
porter, among those who attempted to clip Stalin’s
wings? That December 1934 Kirov was murdered,
Stalin was implicated. That he acted as pallbearer at
Kirov’s funeral is no evidence to the contrary. Theﬁrst mass terror-wave of arrests and executions fol-
lowed. Then there was a pause, just as there had
been with collectivisation. Stalin in 1936 even pro-

mulgated a constitution guaranteeing every con-

ceivable human and civic right! It was no more
than a façade that misled only the most gullible.Then the arrests and executions were resumed.The years from 1936 to 1938 are known as the
Great Terror. At the end, Stalin emerged as the
undisputed dictator whom none could resist.Stalin turned on the elite of communist society,the party functionaries, the army ofﬁcers from the
junior to the commander-in-chief, the technocratsand managers. The world learnt only a little fromthe show trials of the prominent leaders, the‘fathers’ of the revolution, who were now paraded
to confess publicly their sins, confessions secured
beforehand by torture and threats. Not only they,
but also their wives and associates, were murdered.Nothing like this had ever occurred before. Stalinacted with cold and ruthless calculation. The vic-

tims of these purges have never been counted.
Dekulakisation, the famine and the purges claimed
millions of victims. No one was safe. Death, exile
or incarceration in the huge complex of labourcamps, the Gulag, was the fate of anyone who fellunder suspicion. The Gulags were not like the later
Nazi extermination camps but unbelievably brutal,
the guards sadistic. Lenin had started them to
break the spirit of the ‘enemies of the people’.Stalin expanded the system of forced labour andtorture, inefficient even in extracting work.178THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39

ebrated 1956 speech. By then more than 18 mil-
lion had been herded into these camps and, 15
million survived – 3 million, largely innocents, lost
their lives, families were destroyed, children
orphaned. The brutal reality of Soviet rule wasdenied by armchair communists in the West andadmirers of Stalin, until the truth had to be faced
well after the end of the Second World War. The
material loss to Russia of skilled people was incal-

culable. The grip of the secret police under the
hated Beria was not loosened until after Stalin’sdeath. There were thousands willing to do Stalin’sbidding and commit all these crimes. He justiﬁed

them by claiming there were conspiracies with out-

side Western powers, with Japan, Germany, Britain
and France, to sabotage and attack the SovietUnion. Did he believe it? Stalin thought ittheoretically possible and that was enough.Stalin had little experience of foreign travel.Behind his notion of Russia’s correct foreign pol-
icy two assumptions or principles can be discerned:Russia’s defence in a hostile capitalist world must
come ﬁrst at all costs; second, the behaviour of
other powers could be deduced by a Leninist
analysis. Not only were these powers motivated by
a joint hostility to the only communist state, butthey were also locked in an imperial struggle forsupremacy among themselves. Thus Soviet theo-

reticians, including Stalin in the 1920s, believed in
the likelihood of war between Britain and the US.
Later, in the early 1930s, Stalin hoped that rivalryin eastern Asia would lead the US to checkJapanese expansion in China. But Soviet hopes
were disappointed by American non-intervention
during the Manchurian crisis of 1931–3.The Soviet view of the West was grotesquelydistorted. The Western social democrats were castin the role of ‘right deviationists’ or ‘social fas-cists’ from 1929 to 1934, more dangerous than
the real fascists. The Nazis were seen as a short-
lived right-wing excess against which the workers
would soon react. There was a lingering fear of Poland and its ally, capitalist France, and of‘hostile’ Britain. Thus, from the West as well 
as from Asia, the Soviet Union appeared to be 
in continuing and great danger.From 1934 to 1938 there was some readjust-ment of Soviet policy and a rapprochement withthe Western democracies. The Soviet Union was
recognised finally by the US when Roosevelt
agreed to establish diplomatic relations in 1933.
In 1934 the Soviet Union joined the League ofNations, and the Commissar for Foreign Affairs,Maxim Litvinov, now preached the need for col-
lective security against Hitler’s Germany and
Mussolini’s Italian expansionist policies. The gen-
uine search for peace did not mean, however, that
the Soviet Union was ready to go to war in alliancewith the Western democracies against Germany.Rather, the Russians wanted to avoid a war break-
ing out altogether, and believed a firm stand
would deter Hitler and Mussolini. If it did not, as
it did not in September 1939, the Soviet leaderswere determined to avoid being involved in warthemselves. If there had to be a war – a situation
full of danger for Russia – then at least it should be
conﬁned to a war between the Western powers. As
long as Nazi Germany could be prevented fromturning ﬁrston Russia, then the Soviet Unionwould remain neutral and appease Germany to
any extent necessary to preserve peace. But the
nightmare of the Soviet leadership was a reverse of
that situation, that France and Britain would stand
aside while Hitler conquered Lebensraum(livingspace)in the east. What is more, would the
Ukrainians and Georgians and other non-Russian
nationalities ﬁght for Russia, when the people

were suffering from such terrible communist
repression? While socialism was still in transition,Russia could not afford war without risking thevery survival of socialism.The Soviet Union attempted to create a‘barrier of peace’ by signing non-aggression
treaties with its neighbours, of whom the most
important was Poland. Until the autumn of 1938Hitler employed no direct violence near Russia’sborders. In eastern Asia the threat of war was met
by a combination of policies, in the ﬁrst place by
appeasing Japan: in 1935 Russia sold its interest
in the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Japanesepuppet state of Manchukuo. It was lessened, fur-thermore, by encouraging Chiang Kai-shek’s
nationalist resistance to Japan in the hope that
Japan would then be too busy ﬁghting China to1SOVIET RUSSIA179
turn on Russia as well. When necessary, however,the Soviet Union did not hesitate to resist mili-tarily any direct Japanese attacks on Soviet spheres
of influence, on the People’s Republic of
Mongolia and along the Russo-Chinese frontier.
There was full-scale ﬁghting between Soviet andJapanese troops in 1938 and in the summer of1939. These were no mere ‘incidents’. Marshal
Zhukov in 1939 had the advantage of modern
tanks and troops far better armed than the
Japanese. The Japanese suffered a severe defeat
and left behind 18,000 dead. Thereafter, theyavoided open conﬂict with Russia. The Soviet
Union and Japan, in fact, remained at peace until
it suited Stalin, shortly before Japan’s surrender,
to attack the Japanese in China in 1945.In the West, the Soviet Union did what it couldto persuade France and Britain to stand up toHitler and Mussolini. The menace they presented
to peace and so to the Soviet Union was belatedly
recognised in 1934. The Soviet Union then
signed a treaty of mutual assistance with France inMay 1935 to strengthen the deterrent alignment.The Soviet Union also joined in the League’s inef-
fectual sanctions to deter Mussolini from con-
quering Abyssinia. In 1934 the new United Front
tactics were acquiesced in when France itself
seemed in danger of succumbing to fascism. Butat the same time the communist leadership wasalways conscious of, and never wished to repeat,
the experiences of the First World War when
Russia was cast in the role of providing military
relief to the West and, in the effort, went down indefeat. Russian policy aimed to maintain a carefulbalance and to avoid war by encouraging the will
of France and Britain to resist. In line with this
overall strategy the Russian help afforded to the
Republican side during the Spanish Civil War was
carefully limited to exclude any possible risk ofwar. It was left to the Comintern to organise theInternational Brigades to ﬁght as volunteers onthe Republican side. But Soviet technical advisers,tanks, aircraft and supplies played a role in the war.The year 1937 saw Stalin’s military purge at itsheight. Russia was more unready than ever to face
military attack from the West. The Soviet Unionalmost frantically attempted to construct a diplo-matic peace front in 1938. It failed. Britain and
France went to Munich in September and con-
sented to the partition of Czechoslovakia. The
Russians, meanwhile, had promised to support
the Czechs only to the extent of their limitedtreaty obligations. Whatever Russian aid mighthave been forthcoming if the Czechs had fought,
it appears certain that Stalin would not have
risked war with Germany. Simultaneously Soviet
diplomats sought to stiffen French and Britishresistance to Hitler by warning their governmentsthat Hitler meant to defeat them. Stalin’s faith in
‘collective security’, probably never strong, did
not survive after the German occupation of
Czechoslovakia in March 1939. It was unlikelythat peace could be preserved much longerbetween Hitler and his neighbours, and Stalin’s
prime objective remained to stop the Soviet
Union from going to war. And so after simulta-
neous and secret negotiations with France and
Britain on the one hand and Germany on theother – a double insurance policy – Stalin, havingdelayed as long as he dared, concluded a non-
aggression pact with Germany on 23 August
1939. Stalin had calculated correctly and kept the
Soviet Union at peace. The Germans extracted aprice in requiring supplies from the Soviet Union.The war that began in September 1939, Stalin
believed, afforded the Soviet Union a long
breathing space during which communism would
strengthen the Soviet Union’s capacity to meet
the dangers still to come. It lasted barely twoyears.180THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
In retrospect there can be no minimising theimportance of one historical date – 30 January
1933, when Adolf Hitler was appointed chan-
cellor of Germany by President von Hindenburg.Within eight years of his coming to power,Germany had conquered continental Europe from
the Channel coast to the gates of Moscow. It was
not a conquest and occupation such as had
occurred in the Great War. In German-occupied
Europe some 10 million people, including 2 mil-
lion children, were deliberately murdered. Hitler’sReich was a reversion into barbarism. Racism as
such was nothing new, nor was it conﬁned to

Germany. These doctrines attracted groups of sup-

porters in most of Europe, including France andBritain, in South America and in the US. But it wasin Germany that the resources of a modern indus-

trial state enabled criminal leaders to murder and
enslave millions. Until the concentration camps
revealed their victims the world was inclined to
believe that a country once in the forefront ofWestern culture, the Germany of Goethe, couldnot so regress. This faith in civilisation was mis-

placed. How was it possible? For just one of the
more easily discernible parts of the explanation we
must turn to the politics of Weimar Germany,which failed to provide stable governments untilpolitical democracy ceased to function altogether
after the onset of the economic crisis of 1929.From 1920 to 1930 no party was strongenough on its own to form a government andenjoy the necessary majority in parliament. Butuntil 1928 a majority in parliament eitherfavoured or at least tolerated the continuation of
the parliamentary system of government. The
Communist Party was too weak in its parliamen-tary representation to endanger the Republic dur-ing the middle years of Weimar prosperity from
1924 to 1928; its strength was appreciably smaller
than that of the deputies of the moderate Socialist
Party. Indeed, the Socialists steadily gained votes
and deputies in the Reichstag. From 100 in May1924 their representation increased to 153 in1928. Signiﬁcantly, the Communist Party fell in
the same period from 62 to 54 Reichstag deputies.
On the extreme anti-democratic right the Nazis
did even worse in parliamentary elections; in May1924 there were 32 Nazis elected to the Reichstagand in 1928 only 12. Even the conservatives, the
Nationalist Party, who formed the opposition for
most of the time from 1918 to 1930, declined in
number from 95 to 73.Weimar Germany appeared to gain in strength.This was not really so. The Nazis were winningadherents wherever there was distress. Even during
the years of comparative prosperity, many of the
farmers did not share the beneﬁts of industrial

expansion. Then governments were discredited bytheir short life-spans – on average only eightmonths. Parties appeared to be locked in purely
selﬁsh battles of personal advantage. The Social
Democratic Party must share in the blame for the
instability of the Weimar coalition governments. It preferred to stay in opposition and not to 1Chapter 17THE FAILURE OF PARLIAMENTARY
DEMOCRACY IN GERMANY AND THE RISEOF HITLER, 1920–34participate in the business of ruling the country.The difﬁculties of any party with socialist aspira-

tions joining a coalition were genuinely great.
Coalition meant compromise on policy. In anycoalition with the centre and moderate right theSocial Democrats could not hope to pass socialist
measures and they were afraid that cooperation
with the ‘bourgeois’ parties would discredit them
with their electoral base, which consisted mainly of
urban workers and trade unionists. From an elec-
toral party point of view these tactics appeared topay off as their increasing representation in the
Reichstag shows. But the price paid was the dis-

crediting of parliamentary government, for the
exclusion from government of both the Nationa-
lists and the Communists and the absence of theSocialists meant that the coalitions of the centre
and mainly moderate right were minority govern-

ments at the mercy of the Socialists.In government there was thus a permanentsense of crisis, the coalition partners who formed
the governments, especially the smaller parties,
becoming more concerned about how the unpop-ularity of a particular government policy mightaffect their own supporters than about the stabil-
ity of government as a whole. This situation
imperilled the standing of the whole parliamen-
tary democratic system. After 1925 there seemed
to be only one method by which the parties ofthe centre and moderate right, saddled with theresponsibility of government, could logically
attain stability and a majority, and that was to
move further to the right. So its right wing came
to predominate the Centre Party, enabling theconservatives, the Nationalist Party, to join coali-tion cabinets with them. The coalition cabinets
were also very much cabinets of ‘personalities’
relying on presidential backing and only loosely182THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39

they seemed to be remedying their earlier mis-
taken policy; but it was very late in the history ofthe parliamentary Republic. The coalition part-ners, especially the Centre Party, had already
moved so far to the right that they now felt ill at
ease working with the Socialists under a Socialist
chancellor. This so-called grand coalition had the
utmost difﬁculty holding together for the twoyears (1928–30) the government lasted, plungingfrom one internal crisis to the next. The inﬂuence
of the brilliantly successful foreign minister,
Gustav Stresemann, just managed to keep the
right wing of the coalition in government. Tocarry through his diplomacy of persuading theAllies to relax their grip on Germany, he needed
a stable government behind him. But the coali-
tion did not survive his death in October 1929.The three years from 1928 to 1930 werecritical in the decline of Weimar Germany.Economic distress was becoming severe among
the small farmers. Then followed the Wall Street
Crash and its chain reaction in Europe. Industrial
output contracted and unemployment soared.
The Nazis were able to capitalise on the grievancesof the small farmers and then as the depressionwidened and deepened they exploited the resent-
ments of the lower-middle classes, the shopkeep-
ers and white-collar workers who were facing
uncertainties and financial hardships and whofeared a Bolshevik revolution from the unem-
ployed industrial workers. On the political scene,
the conservative Nationalist Party was excluded
from power by the ‘grand coalition’ which in
1928 supported a broader-based government.
The Nationalists in that year had fallen under theleadership of a wealthy industrialist and publisher,Alfred Hugenberg, who hated Weimar democracy
and socialism equally. The Nationalists had not
done well in the elections of 1928. The effect 
of their setback was to encourage Hugenberg to look to the more extreme right for votes. In the wings, the small, violent and racialist Nazi
Party stood on the threshold of achieving mass
support.The ﬁrst opportunity for the Nazis to make asigniﬁcant electoral impact in the Reichstag elec-
tions came in 1930. The economic crisis had bro-

ken up the Socialist-led grand coalition. Thepartners of that coalition could not agree whetheremployers or the workers should suffer from the
government’s only remedy to the crisis, the cutting
back of expenditure. Like the majority of theLabour Party in Britain, the Social Democratscould not remain in a government that reduced
unemployment beneﬁts. President von Hinden-
burg now called on the leader of the Centre Party,Heinrich Brüning, to lead a new government.
There were threats that the president would dis-

pense with the Reichstag’s approval and resort toemergency decrees provided for in the constitutionif it rejected Brüning’s savage deﬂation. This hap-

pened within a few weeks and Brüning now stakedhis future on dissolving the Reichstag and on a newelection. Its unexpected result and its political con-

sequences ushered in the ﬁnal phase of Weimar

democracy. The vote of the Nazis increased fromsome 810,000 in 1928 to nearly 6.5 million in theSeptember 1930 election. They increased their
representation from 12 to 107, just behind theSocialists, who had 143, and nudged ahead of theCommunists, who had 77, to become the second-
largest party. The conservative Nationalists lost
half their support.It would still, perhaps, have been just possibleto stabilise the political fortunes of Weimar, but
Brüning’s ﬁnancial ‘cures’ killed any chance of thishappening. Conﬁdence throughout the country inthe ability of the politicians to solve the crisis
ebbed away. Economists of the Keynesian school
of thought met with complete rejection in theBrüning era. (The Nazis lent them a more readyear.) There was an alternative policy of expansion
and of credit and of state help to put the unem-ployed to work. Financially the country was slid-ing into a position where administrators felt that
something had to be done. In parliament, the
Social Democrats, under the great shock of theNational Socialist landslide, backed the minorityBrüning government from the benches of the
opposition as far as they could. Brüning’s prefer-ence was for authoritarian, austere government,and with Hindenburg’s backing he governed by
emergency presidential decrees.1THE FAILURE OF DEMOCRACY AND RISE OF HITLER, 1920–34183
Hindenburg did not want Hitler to come topower. He felt a strong antipathy for the‘Bohemian corporal’ (he was actually a Bavarian
corporal), a violent uncouth Austrian who shared
none of Hindenburg’s own Prussian Junker qual-
ities. When Hindenburg was elected president in1925 by a narrow margin over the candidate ofthe Socialists and Centre, the spectacle of an
avowed monarchist and legendary war hero, the
most decorated and honoured of the kaiser’s 
ﬁeld marshals, heading a republic seemed incon-
gruous indeed. But the 77-year-old symbol ofpast glories did his job decently enough, evenraising the respectability of the Republic by con-
senting to serve as its head. But all his life he had
been trained to believe in command and leader-
ship, and the spectacle of parliamentary bickeringand the musical chairs the politicians were playingin and out of government appeared to him a trav-
esty of what Germany needed.Nevertheless, the ﬁeld marshal could be reliedon to honour his oath to the republican constitu-
tion. This gave him the constitutional right to actin an emergency, and he believed, not without jus-

tiﬁcation, that the destructive behaviour of the
political parties during the economic crisis of 1929
to 1930 had created a crisis of government. The
Young Plan, which ﬁxed the total amount of repa-
rations at 121 thousand million marks to be paid in instalments over ﬁfty-nine years, was assailed by

the Nazis and the right. In 1932, however, at
Lausanne, the amount was reduced to 3,000 mil-

lion marks. Brüning’s attempt to court Nationalistopinion and aid the stricken economy by announc-
ing an Austro-German customs union in 1931
failed because the Allies declared that it broke the
Versailles Treaty, which prohibited the union of
Austria and Germany. Thus, dissatisﬁed, German

nationalism was further increased. The army nowenjoyed great inﬂuence and the attention of histor-ians has been especially focused on the few men,
including Hindenburg’s son, who increasingly
gained the old gentleman’s conﬁdence and inﬂu-

enced his decisions.Brüning governed with austere authority,integrity and disastrous results. Raising taxes and
reducing salaries was naturally unpopular, all the
more so as the economic crisis deepened.Unemployment rose from 2.25 million in 1930to over 6 million in 1932. Brüning in April 1932tried to curb street violence by banning all the
private armies such as the SA, the SS and the
Stahlhelm. His intentions were good but this
measure, too, was largely ineffectual as the organ-isations survived without openly wearing uni-
forms. At the depth of the crisis in 1932 the
presidential term of ofﬁce expired. Hindenburg
was deeply chagrined not to be re-elected unop-
posed. Hitler chose to stand against him and lost,
but more signiﬁcant than his failure was the factthat more than 13 million had voted for him.Hindenburg had secured over 19 million votes
but was so old that he could not last much longer.
Shortly after the presidential elections in May
1932 Hindenburg dropped Brüning. Franz vonPapen became chancellor, enjoying no support inthe Reichstag or the country. Less than a year was
left before Hitler assumed power over Germany.
How had he, a complete unknown only eleven
years earlier, achieved this transformation?Fewer than three out of every hundredGermans voted for the Nazis at the national elec-
tion of 1928 and that was after seven years of
unceasing Nazi propaganda. But the Nazis had
built an organisational base and increased the
party’s membership signiﬁcantly. Nazi ideologywas no consistent or logically developed theorysuch as Marxism claimed to be. There was
nothing original about any of its aspects. It incor-
porated the arrogant nationalistic and race ideas
of the nineteenth century, speciﬁcally the anti-Semitic doctrines and the belief in Germanuniqueness and Germany’s world mission,
together with elements of fascism and socialism,
for in its early days the National Socialist Workers’
Party wooed the urban worker.The National Socialists, or Nazis for short, hadgrown out of one of the many small racialist and
nationalist groups already ﬂourishing in Germany
– one organised in Munich by a man called Anton
Drexler. His name would have remained insignif-icant but for Hitler’s association with the group.Under Hitler’s leadership from July 1921
onwards, the party was opportunistic, seeking to
grow strong on all the resentments felt by differ-184THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
ent sections of the German people: the smallfarmers, who suffered from the agriculturaldepression and, later, inﬂation; the middle class,
whose status was threatened and whose savings
had been wiped out; unemployed workers; those
industrialists at the other end of the scale whowere the declared enemies of socialism even in itsmildest form; theologians, mainly Protestant, who
saw in Nazism a spiritual revival against Weimar
materialism. The extreme nationalism of the
Nazis made a strong appeal.Few of those who were early supportersaccepted all the disparate objectives that Nazismpurported to stand for, but every group of sup-
porters was prepared to discount, overlook or
accept as the ‘lesser evil’ those things it inwardly
disapproved of. They saw in Hitler and his move-ment what they wished to see. This same attitudealso accounts for the view that there was a ‘good
Hitler’ who cured unemployment and unified
Germany, and a ‘bad Hitler’ who persecuted the
Jews, made war and ignored justice when dealingwith individuals and minority groups. That atti-tude assumes that one does not have to judge the
‘whole’ but can accept the evils for the sake of
the beneﬁts.Nazism exploited the backward-looking con-servatism that ﬂourished in Germany after the dis-illusionment of defeat in 1918. ParadoxicallyHitler imposed a revolution of values and atti-
tudes that plunged German society into acceler-
ating change after 1933. But what some of those
Germans who supported him saw in Hitler in the1920s was a return to an old virtuous Germany,a simpler Germany that had never existed. Hitler’s
emphasis on the need for a healthy people to 
live close to the land has a history dating back 
to well before 1914. It was erroneously argued
that modern Germany lacked land and space fora ‘healthy’ expansion of the people. Hence theobsession with gaining Lebensraum, and Hitler’splans for satisfying these ‘needs’ in the east.
Hitler, too, dwelt obsessively on the medieval
image of the Jew as an alien, a parasite, who pro-
duced nothing but lived off the work of others.‘Work’ was ploughing the land, the sweat of the
brow, not sitting in banks and lending money.
Yet, he also had sound instincts which led him toaccept some modern economic concepts as a wayout of the miseries of the last Weimar years. Thediscredited race doctrines of the nineteenth
century were reinforced and amplified in the
study of a new race biology. The ideology of race
lent a spurious cohesion to Nazi policies.This was a turning back on the age of reason.Numerous organisations from the large veteran
association, the Stahlhelm, to small so-called
völkischgroups embraced strident nationalism anda mystical Teutonic secular faith. None saw in
Weimar’s parliamentary democracy anything buta shameful subordination of the German nationto alien foreign domination. It was identiﬁed also
with the Jews, who played a small but distin-
guished role in its constitutional, administrative,
economic and artistic life, although they formedonly 1 per cent of the nation’s population. Theywere besmirched by Nazi calumnies that they
were war proﬁteers and corrupters. More signiﬁ-
cant than the slanders themselves is the wide cre-
dence that these lies won in Germany.The counterpart to this support for right-wingextremism in its various forms was the lack of
positive support and understanding by the major-
ity of Germans for the spirit of parliamentary
democracy. In the 1920s anti-democratic ideas
were not only propagated by the communists andby the ignorant and ill-educated, but foundstrong support among the better-off, middle-class
youth, especially within the student unions and
universities. Stresemann’s success in dismantling
the punitive aspects of Versailles won no acclaimbecause his methods were peaceful and concilia-tory, as they had to be if they were to succeed in
the years immediately after the war. The notion
that a democracy tolerates different ideas and dif-
ferent approaches to solving problems was,
instead, condemned as disunity, as the strife andchaos of parties. The parties themselves – apartfrom the totalitarian-oriented Nazi and Com-
munist Parties – rarely understood that they had
to place the well-being of the whole nation before
narrow party interests, that even while theyattacked each other they had to acknowledge acommon framework and defend above all parlia-
mentary democracy itself. Democracy was
regarded as representing the lowest common1THE FAILURE OF DEMOCRACY AND RISE OF HITLER, 1920–34185
denominator of politics, the rule of the masses.Fascism and Nazism also appealed to the elitists,who saw themselves as leading the masses.The educated and better-off followers fearedabove everything ‘social revolution’; they pre-
ferred the Nazi promise of ‘national revolution’which would, they thought, enhance their careeropportunities. What made the Nazis so successful
was precisely the combination of physical force 
in the streets, which was welcomed by anti-
communists, and the support of the ‘professionals’
in the army, civil service, the churches and educa-tion. They, the supposedly educated elite, hadhelped to undermine Weimar democracy even 
in the years of prosperity, and made Nazism
respectable. In the absence of strong positive 
support, democracy – and with it the rule of law –is dangerously exposed. It could not survive theeconomic blizzard of 1929 to 1932, which was
not the root cause of its downfall but more the
ﬁnal blow. Nevertheless, there were regions of
Germany that did not succumb to the tidal waveof Nazism even in 1933; this is true of the stronglyCatholic Rhineland and Bavaria. In the big indus-
trial cities, too, such as Berlin and Hamburg, most
factory workers in the beginning continued to
support the Social Democrats and the Commu-
nists. The rise of the Nazis to power was not theinevitable consequence of the lost war, of inﬂationand depression. It was not automatic, the result of
the inexorable working out of the disadvantages
besetting Germany after 1918. Hitler succeeded
because a sufficient mass of German people,including many in leading positions of society,chose to support what he stood for. While he did
not reveal all his aims, he did reveal enough to be
rejected by anyone believing in democracy and
basic human rights. Among mainly young Nazi
thugs there were many political and warped ideal-ists. Other supporters were opportunists joining abandwagon for reasons of personal gain. Many
saw in Hitler a saviour who would end Germany’s
‘humiliation’ and the ‘injustices’ of Versailles.No preparation for power was stranger or moreunlikely than Adolf Hitler’s. He lived for ﬁfty-six
years, from his birth in the small Austrian town
of Braunau on 20 April 1889 until his suicide on30 April 1945 in his bunker under the Reichchancellery in Berlin. During the last twelve yearsof his life he dominated ﬁrst Germany and then
most of continental Europe. His impact on the
lives of millions was immense, responsible as he
was for immeasurable human misery. He believedmankind to be engaged in a colossal strugglebetween good and evil and he made this hysteri-
cal fantasy come true more nearly than any single
man had done before. Yet nothing in the ﬁrst
thirty years of his life pointed to the terrible
impact he would make on history.Mein Kampf, ‘My Struggle’, which Hitler wrote during his short spell of imprisonment in
1924, glamorised his past. Hitler suffered no hard-

ship other than the consequences of his own early
restless way of life. His father was a conscientiouscustoms ofﬁcial who died when he was fourteenyears old; his mother was devoted and did her
best for her son, whose attachment to her was
deep. But Hitler could not accustom himself to
regular work, even during his secondary schooldays. Supported financially by his mother, hedrifted into a lonely way of life, avoiding all regular
work, aspiring to be an artist. He attempted to
gain entrance to the Academy of Fine Arts in
Vienna but was rejected, as were the majority of
applicants. Nevertheless, in his nineteenth year hemoved to the Habsburg capital. His mother hadrecently died from cancer; Hitler had cared for her
during the ﬁnal traumatic phase, aided by a Jewish
doctor to whom he expressed his gratitude and
presented one of his watercolours.For the next two years the money left to himby his parents and an orphan’s pension provided
him with an adequate income. He could indulge
his fancies; he read a great deal and impractically
designed grandiose buildings in the backroom of
his lodgings. He continued in this lonely andirregular lifestyle; soon all the money he hadinherited was spent.There is little reliable information about hisnext two years. He disappeared from view, living in
poverty without attempting regular work, relyingon charity and boarding in cheap hostels. It wouldseem probable that he still dreamt of becoming an
architect and, more importantly, imbibed the
crude anti-Semitic and racialist ideas current in186THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
Vienna at that time. In May 1913, in his twenty-fourth year, he moved to Munich, Bavaria’s artisticcapital. He lived there by selling sketches and
watercolours, executed with care and photo-

graphic accuracy, pleasing pictures of no great
artistic merit. He could, then, be fairly described asself-educated but without discipline, with sufﬁcient
artistic skill to have earned his living as an engraver
or poster designer had he desired regular work. He
was essentially a loner, who had established no
deep relationships, and he was already ﬁlled with

resentments and hatreds which came to be centredmore and more on the Jews.He later regarded the outbreak of the GreatWar as the turning point in his life. He volun-
teered for the Bavarian army with enthusiasm. He
already saw himself as a pan-German, and not aloyal subject of the multinational Habsburgs,whom he detested. During the war he was
wounded and awarded the Iron Cross First Class;
he served as a dispatch messenger, though in 
those days communications were passed mainly onfoot along the small distances from trench totrench or from one command post to another. It
is notable that he was never promoted beyond the
rank of corporal, despite the desperate need for
NCOs, a reﬂection of his superior’s view that
Corporal Hitler was not a suitable leader of men.When he returned to Munich after the war at theage of twenty-nine, his lack of formal qualiﬁcation
and education was typical of millions for whom
the future looked grim. But it is from this point on
that his hitherto insigniﬁcant and unsuccessful lifetook a fantastic new turn.For a start, his interest in politics and loyaltycommended him to the new Reichswehr. The
army retained him in a division for ‘military edu-
cation’. One of his tasks was to investigate and
infiltrate dubious, possibly left-wing, politicalgroups. In this way he came to join Drexler’ssmall German Workers’ Party, more a beer hall
debating society than a genuine party. The trans-
formation of Hitler now began. As a political agi-
tator and an orator who could move his audiencesto emotion and hysteria with the violence of hislanguage, Hitler discovered a new vocation. He
did not of course see himself as the leader of
Germany at this stage, but rather as the propa-gandist who would help to power the extremenationalists – men like Ludendorff who wouldrescue Germany from ‘Bolshevism’ and the Jews
and who would break the shackles of Versailles.Hitler fulminated against the world Jewishconspiracy, Wall Street and ‘Bolshevism’, andagainst the injustices of Versailles, until out ofDrexler’s debating club a real party emerged with
55,000 supporters by 1923. From 1921 Hitler 
led that party, renamed the National Socialist
German Workers’ Party (or by its German initials
NSDAP). Hitler the rabid rabble-rousing politi-cian had arrived, a fact made possible only by thetotally chaotic political condition of Bavaria where
a disparate right had bloodily defeated an equally
disparate left. In November 1923 Hitler mis-

judged the situation and sought to seize power forthe forces of the right in much the same way asLenin had seized control of Petrograd with a few
devoted revolutionaries. His attempted Munich
Putschended ignominiously, Hitler ﬂeeing whenthe police opened ﬁre. Ludendorff alone, withmore courage than good sense, marched throughthe cordon of police. Hitler had expected that 
he would seize power without bloodshed and 
that the police and army would rally to the
Ludendorff–Hitler alliance. Later he recognised
that failure had saved him. Had he succeeded ingaining control and marched on ‘Red Berlin’ as heintended, the government would not have capitu-
lated to a fanatic and extremist. Nor, as the army
high command knew, would the French, who had
entered the Ruhr, have tolerated for a moment acoup led by a man who so stridently denouncedthe Versailles Treaty; the French, moreover, still
possessed the strength and determination to pre-
vent such a coup. Hitler would then have been ﬁn-
ished for good.Hitler turned his trial for treason, conductedin Bavaria by judges who sympathised with hiscause, into a personal propaganda triumph.
Sentenced to the minimum term of ﬁve years’
imprisonment, he actually only served a few
months. While in prison he started writing MeinKampfand after his release he began to rebuildthe party that was to carry him to power. The
Munich Putschhad convinced him that theNationalist right could not be trusted and was too1THE FAILURE OF DEMOCRACY AND RISE OF HITLER, 1920–34187
feeble. He would be the leader, not they. From1925 to 1928 there were two important devel-opments: a steady but slow growth of member-
ship of the Nazi Party and continuing bitter
internal disputes among the leaders, notably
Joseph Goebbels, Julius Streicher and the Strasserbrothers, Gregor and Otto. Hitler was handi-
capped by a ban on his making public speeches
until May 1928, and he did not dare defy it for
fear of being deported from Germany as an
Austrian citizen. He nevertheless sought to create
a tight, national Nazi organisation, insisting onabsolute obedience to himself. Right up to thefinal triumph of 30 January 1933, when he
became chancellor, there was a real threat of
defections from the Nazi Party he led.In 1925 Hitler judged that the establishedgovernment was too strong to be seized by force.He changed his tactics. He would follow the
legal, constitutional road by entering Reichstag
elections to gain a majority, and only then estab-
lish his dictatorship. He never showed anythingbut contempt for the Reichstag and, thoughleader of the party, would never himself take part
in its proceedings. He advised his followers ‘to
hold their nose’ when in the Reichstag. During
the period from 1925 to 1928 he built up his
party as a virulent propaganda machine, insistedthat he alone should lead it, without requiring theadvice of leading party personalities, for it was an
essential element of his plans to cultivate the cult
of the Führer or Leader. The party membership
reached 97,000 in 1929. Was the economic crisisthen not the real cause of this sudden success?The economic crisis which overtook the world is
usually dated from the time of the Wall Street
Crash in 1929. But this is misleading. By the
winter of 1927–8 distress was already felt in
Germany among the small agricultural farmersand workers in north-west Germany and by arti-sans and small shopkeepers especially. The Nazi
party made considerable headway in rural districts
in local and state elections in 1929 at the expense
of the traditional Conservative and NationalistParties.In that same year with the economic crisis deep-
ening, the conservative Nationalist, Hugenberg,
hoped to gain power by forming a broad alliance ofthe right and using Hitler to win the support ofthose masses which the conservatives had failed toattract. A vicious campaign was launched against
the Young reparations plan of 1929. The repara-

tions and the politicians of Weimar were blamed
for Germany’s economic ills. The economic andNationalist assault proved explosive. But theGerman electorate’s reaction in the Reichstag elec-

tion of September 1930 was not what Hugenberg
expected: the Nationalists lost heavily and the
Nazis made their ﬁrst breakthrough at the level of

national elections, winning 107 seats to becomethe second-largest party after the Socialists. In a lit-
tle more than two years their electoral support had
increased from 810,000 to 6.5 million.The period from 1930 to the end of January1933 was in many ways the most testing forHitler. Industrialists, however, began to hedge
their bets and substantial ﬁnancial contributions
began ﬂowing into Nazi funds. The propaganda
campaign against Weimar became ever morevicious. Support among the industrial workers inthe big cities could not be won over; the Catholic
south remained largely immune too. Although
originating in Bavaria, the Nazis gained the great-
est following in rural northern Germany. The
white-collar workers, the rural voters and ele-
ments of what is rather unsatisfactorily labelledthe middle class, especially those threatened by
Brüning’s ﬁnancial measures with a drop in their
standard of living, were the new Nazi voters. The
Nazis and Nationalists did all in their power todiscredit Weimar democracy. Papen, the newchancellor in June 1932, hoped to gain Hitler’s
sympathetic support by lifting the ban on the 
SA (Sturm Abteilung, or storm troopers) and, inJuly, by illegally ousting the socialist government
of Prussia.Papen’s Cabinet of ‘Barons’, as it becameknown from the titled nonentities of which it was
composed, enjoyed no support in the Reichstag.
The effect of the two elections that Papen induced
Hindenburg to call in July and November 1932 inan unsuccessful attempt to secure some support inthe country and parliament were the cofﬁn nails of
democracy, for those parties that were determined
to destroy the Weimar Republic between them188THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
won a comfortable majority in the Reichstag. TheNazis in July won 230 seats and 37 per cent of thevote, becoming the largest single party; in the
election of November 1932 they held on to 33 per
cent of the electorate, saw their seats drop to 196,
but remained the largest party; the Nationalistssecured almost 9 per cent, and the Communists17 per cent (100 seats) – nor did the three anti-
democratic parties have any scruples about acting
together. The Socialists slipped from 133 seats to
121. Papen had gambled on making the Nazis
more amenable by inﬂicting an electoral defeat onthem. The Nazis did indeed suffer a setback inNovember 1932. Papen was pleased, but Hitler
had lost only a battle, not a war. On 17 November
Papen resigned. Hitler thought his moment had
come. Summoned to Hindenburg, he was told bythe ﬁeld marshal that he would be considered aschancellor only if he could show that a parliamen-
tary majority backed him and that, unlike Papen,
he could govern without special presidential
decrees. Such conditions, Hindenburg and Hitlerperfectly well knew, could not be met. Theyamounted to a rejection of Hitler.Hindenburg wanted his favourite, Papen, back.Papen planned to prorogue the Reichstag and
change the constitution. However, General Kurt
von Schleicher, who represented the right of the army high command and who had played an influential political role behind the scenes, 
persuaded Hindenburg that Papen’s plans would
lead to civil war and that the army had lost conﬁ-
dence in Papen’s ability to control the situation.With obvious reluctance Hindenburg appointedSchleicher on 2 December 1932 to head the last
pre-Hitler government. Schleicher’s own solution
was to try to split the Nazi Party and to win the
support of Gregor Strasser and his more left-wing
section of the party. Strasser, who was very inﬂu-ential as the head of the party’s political organisa-tion, had become disillusioned with Hitler’s
tactics of demanding total power and his adamant
refusal to share power with coalition partners.
Despite evidence of falling Nazi support in theNovember 1932 election, Hitler won. Strassermade the task easier for him by resigning from the
party in early December 1932 after bitterly quar-
relling with Hitler, who accused him of treachery.Hindenburg’s opposition and internal disputesmade many Nazis feel that their chance of gainingpower was ebbing away. But Hitler was proved
right only a few weeks later. Schleicher announced
his government’s programme for relieving unem-
ployment and distress; wages and beneﬁts wereraised, but even so the divided Reichstag wasunited on one issue alone – to refuse Schleicher
their backing. Papen, meanwhile, ensured that the
only outcome of Schleicher’s failure would be a
new coalition ostensibly led by Hitler but which
Papen expected to control.Hindenburg was cajoled into concluding thatthe parliamentary crisis could be ended only by
offering the chancellorship to Hitler, the leader of
the largest party, even though Hitler had not set
foot in the Reichstag as a parliamentary leader. Theins and outs of the ﬁnal intrigues that overcameHindenburg’s obvious reluctance are still debated
by historians. Papen and the conservative and
nationalist right totally misjudged and under-

estimated Hitler. They believed they could tamehim, that he would have to rely on their skills ofgovernment. Instead, Hitler ended the parliamen-

tary crisis in short order by doing what he said he
would do, that is by crushing the spirit of the
Weimar constitution and setting up a totalitarian
state. But Papen’s intrigues were merely the ﬁnal
blow to the already undermined structure ofWeimar’s democracy; it cannot be overlooked that
Hitler, whose party had openly proclaimed that it
stood for the destruction of Weimar, had won one-
third of the votes in November 1932; this meant ahigher proportion of electors supported the NaziParty than had supported any other single party at
previous post-1920 Reichstag elections. Given the
multiplicity of parties and the system of propor-

tional representation, a greater electoral victory
than the Nazis achieved is difﬁcult to conceive. It
was not backstairs diplomacy alone then thatbrought Hitler to power, but the votes of millions
of people which made his party the largest in the
Reichstag by far. In November 1932 the Nazis had
polled 11,737,000 votes against 7,248,000 of thesecond-largest party, the Social Democrats.There is a strong contrast between the long waitfor power and the speed with which Hitler1THE FAILURE OF DEMOCRACY AND RISE OF HITLER, 1920–34189
silenced and neutralised all opposition to estab-lish a totalitarian regime. The destruction ofWeimar democracy, and the civic rights that were
guaranteed to all German citizens was accom-

plished behind a legal façade which stilled con-
sciences of all those in the state who should haveresisted. The reasons for the lack of oppositionhad their roots in the past. The elites who led the
German state – the majority of administrators,
civil servants, the army, the churches too – had
followed a long tradition of defaming democracy;
Hitler’s anti-Semitism and his attacks on minori-ties were nothing new in their thinking. All themore honour to the minority who refused to
accept the changes and actively resisted or left the
country. Almost half the German electorate was
prepared to support Hitler in the hope of bettertimes, to be brought about by a ‘national revolu-tion’ and an end to Weimar and disunity.The Nazis occupied only three posts in thecoalition Cabinet. Hitler was chancellor; Hermann
Göring was placed in charge of Prussia as ministerwithout portfolio and Prussian minister of the interior under vice-chancellor Papen; and Wilhelm
Frick was minister of the interior. The government
posts had been carefully arranged so that the army
and the Foreign Ministry, as well as other key min-

istries, were not under Nazi control. Papen and theNationalists soon discovered that Hitler was notinhibited from exercising control by the constitu-

tional niceties that had been devised to restrain
him. This was no Weimar coalition government!The easy, almost effortless path to total dicta-torial power makes melancholy reading. Thesetting alight of the Reichstag on 27 February
1933, probably by the unbalanced Dutchman van
der Lubbe alone – though there can be no cer-
tainty – became the pretext for an emergency
decree signed by Hindenburg suspending per-
sonal liberties and political rights.Hitler had insisted on new elections as a con-dition of accepting ofﬁce, intending to gain an
absolute majority, and he meant to make sure of
it. Accordingly, despite Papen’s supposed senior-ity, Göring seized control of Prussia, which com-prised two-thirds of Germany, and under cover of
the emergency decree terrorised the opponents of
the Nazis. After an electoral campaign of unpar-alleled violence and intimidation, with JosephGoebbels manipulating press and radio to helpsecure a Nazi victory, the Nazis just failed to 
gain the expected overall majority. Their votes
rose to over 17 million; the Socialists held on to
over 7 million votes and the Communists, despitethe Nazi campaign, polled 4.8 million votes; theCentre Party secured nearly 4.5 million and the
Nationalists (DNVP) a disappointing 3.1 million.
But, together with the Nationalists, the Nazis
could muster a majority against all other parties,
sufficient to govern with the support of theReichstag. This was obviously not Hitler’s aim.He sought dictatorial power and a change of the
constitution, but this required a two-thirds
majority and shrewdly he wished to proceed in a
pseudo-legal way to assure himself of the supportof the country afterwards.Not a single communist deputy of the 81elected could take his seat. All were already in the
hands of the Gestapo or being hunted down.
More than twenty of the Socialists also wereunder arrest or prevented from attending. StillHitler needed the support of the Nationalists 
and so to reassure them and the army and the
president, he staged an opening ceremony of 
the Reichstag in the shrine of monarchical
Junkerdom, the old garrison church of Potsdamwhere Frederick the Great lay buried. But evenwith the communists prevented from voting and
the Nationalists voting on his side, Hitler still
lacked the two-thirds majority he needed. It will
always be to the shame of the members of theonce great Centre Party that they tempered theirprinciples and threw in their lot with Hitler, and
agreed to vote for his dictatorial law. They lost
the will to resist, and the leadership later came to
an agreement to secure Catholic interests. It was
left to the Socialist Party alone to vote againstHitler’s so-called Enabling Law, which acquiredits two-thirds majority on 23 March 1933 with
the storm troopers howling vengeance outside
the Reichstag on anyone who dared to oppose
Hitler’s will.Now Hitler was able to put his aims into prac-tice with far less restraint. Under the sinister appli-
cation of the term Gleischaltung (coordination or, literally, a switch used to bring one current in190THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
line with another), a vague all-embracing aim was set out forcibly to subordinate all the activities
of German society – government, administration,
the free press and trade unions – to Nazi bodies 
set up specially to supervise them. Thus while insome cases the old institutions remained, theywere subject to new Nazi controls. The whole
process was haphazard and new Nazi organisa-
tions proliferated, frequently in rivalry with each
other as well. Hitler in the ﬁnal resort would
decide between conﬂicting authorities. Until hedid so there was the inevitable chaos and inﬁght-ing. For a time he might decide it best not to
interfere too much in a particular administra-
tive branch or, for example, leave the high 
command of the army intact. The completeprocess of Gleischaltung would be applied later tothe army also. Hitler insisted on his own ﬁnal say,
on maintaining some of the traditional structures
as long as he thought this tactically necessary to
overcome misgivings among broad sections of theGerman people or powerful groups such as thearmy. His revolution would be complete but 
gradual. The Nazi state was thus no efficient
monolith. Within the overall framework of accep-
tance of the Führer as leader, rivalries ﬂourished
and independent policies were still pursued forshort periods. During the early years there wereeven islands of legality and normality to confuse
opinion at home and abroad.Among the ﬁrst steps that Hitler took was toabolish the independent powers of the federalstates in March 1933. In April a decree purged
the civil service of Jews and those of Jewishdescent, and of anyone whom the Nazis deemedto oppose the regime’s aims. In Prussia a quarterof the higher civil service was dismissed, includ-
ing judges who were supposed to be irremovable.
The Supreme Court in Leipzig secretly debated
whether they should make a protest at this uncon-stitutional act, and decided on discretion. Nowonder the German public was misled by the
seeming legality of these new ‘laws’. During the
course of the summer of 1933, the remaining
independent parties were disbanded. The com-
munist leaders were already in the new concen-tration camps. The Vatican now decided toconclude a treaty – the Concordat – with Hitler
in a misguided effort to protect Catholic interests.
The independent trade unions were quickly
brought to heel and suppressed, and the workersenrolled in the Nazi Labour Front. The press andbroadcasting were placed under Goebbels’ direc-
tion. The universities did not put up any real
resistance either. There were famous professors
such as the philosopher Martin Heidegger who,at least for a short time, gave public support tothe Nazi movement. Some became ardent Nazis
out of conviction; many, for the sake of their
careers.Academics participated in the famous burningof the books by Jewish and anti-Nazi authors.Many of Germany’s internationally known scien-tists, writers and artists joined the ‘national revo-
lution’ of the Nazis. Nor were theologians
immune from the Nazi corruption: Christ became
an Aryan. The dismissed Jews, such as AlbertEinstein, began to leave the country. So did a fewChristian Germans, including the Nobel Prize-
winning writer Thomas Mann. Germany’s other
literary giant, who had also won the Nobel Prize
for literature, Gerhart Hauptmann, remained in
Nazi Germany, adorning the new regime.Hitler was sensitive to German public opinion.The German people, he understood, would need
to be ‘educated’ to accept the harshness and ﬁnal
brutality in stages. So, when Jews were dismissed
from the civil service, some were granted theirstate pensions provided they had completed atleast ten years of service. Those Jews who had
fought in the First World War or whose sons or
fathers had died in the war were temporarily1THE FAILURE OF DEMOCRACY AND RISE OF HITLER, 1920–34191

exempted from dismissal at Hindenburg’srequest. Terror was exercised against specificopponents. Dachau was the ﬁrst concentration
camp, established near Munich in 1933 by
Heinrich Himmler, head of the Bavarian Political
Police. It became the model for others, and bythe summer of 1933 some 30,000 Germans wereheld in concentration camps. Himmler soon
advanced to become the Reichsführer of the SS
(Schutzstaffel) and head of the police throughoutthe Reich. The courts and police also continued
to function.Germany was left as a mosaic where the normalprocess of law and administration continued to
function fairly in some instances. In other areas
the Nazis or the terror arm of the SS were
supreme, and no appeal to the courts was possible.Jewish students were for a time permitted to con-tinue their university studies on a quota system.
Until 1938, some Jewish businesses continued to
trade, a few even later, though many went bank-
rupt.‘I always go as far as I dare and never farther’,
Hitler told a meeting of party leaders in April1937. So Hitler, at the same time as he breached
the vital principles of basic civic rights, gave the
outward appearance of acting mildly and reason-
ably, and always in conformity with proper ‘laws’.
And did not the person of President Hindenburgguarantee decency? The German people did notrealise how the president was losing power to
Hitler. But knowledge of the concentration camps
was a deterrent to any thought of opposition from
all except the most courageous.Hitler was especially careful to appease thearmy. He assured it of an independent status and
of its position as the sole armed force in the state.
The army wished to draw on the young storm
troopers whom it would train as a large armed
force that could quickly augment the regular armyin time of crisis. This meant the subordination ofthe SA to the needs of the army. The head of the
storm troopers, Ernst Röhm, had entirely differ-
ent ideas. The storm troopers were not only a
separate army in the state, but he saw them underhis command as the untainted force which wouldcarry through the complete Nazi revolution in
opposition to Hitler, who appeared willing to
compromise with the old elements of power, thearmy and industrialists. Hitler reacted ruthlesslyand, with the help of the Reichswehr during whatbecame known as the Night of the Long Knives
on 30 June 1934, had Röhm and many senior
ofﬁcers of the SA murdered. The same opportu-
nity was taken to murder General von Schleicher,Gregor Strasser and two of Papen’s close associ-ates, as a warning to Papen’s nationalist ‘allies’.
Hitler, with the connivance of the army, had now
openly set himself above the law.On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg, the one manmore revered than Hitler, died. He was buried atan impressive funeral ceremony and for the lasttime Hitler took a back seat. With Hindenburg
were laid to rest symbolically the last vestiges of
the Prussian Junker and military traditions of
honour and service. The moment Hindenburgdied Hitler took another important step towardssupreme power. A plebiscite merged the ofﬁces of
president and chancellor: Hitler, who now
became the Führer and Reich chancellor. The
Reichswehr generals, believing that they wouldstill control all military decisions, did not opposeHitler’s demand that the army should swear a per-
sonal oath of loyalty to him as head of state.
Enormous power was now concentrated in
Hitler’s hands. But still he moved with caution,
step by step, accepting that he would need timeto achieve his goals.The year 1934 also witnessed the belated smallbeginnings of protest against the implications of
Nazi anti-Semitism though only as far as it
affected the Church’s own administration, andthe largely unsuccessful attempts by Hitler to sub-ordinate the Protestant Church. That Hitler did
not choose immediately to crush the opposition
of the Confessional Protestant Church movement
and other protests, however, was due not to mod-
eration, as people mistakenly thought, but to hiscaution, his wish to dominate only gradually allspheres of German life. He bided his time.Hitler had a clear view of priorities. At homethe most important issue was unemployment. If
he could get the out-of-work back into factoriesand construction, enable the small businesses tobecome sufﬁciently proﬁtable again, and provide
security and promotion opportunities for civil ser-
vants and army ofﬁcers, their support for him192THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
would be sure. If he failed on the economic front,he would be likely to fail all along the line. Thatis why Hitler was prepared to tolerate the con-
tinuation of Jewish businesses, to allow Jewish
salesmen to remain prominent in the export trade
until 1938, and to make use of unorthodox ﬁnan-cial management to achieve a rapid reduction ofthe unemployed; real incomes would cease to fall.Between March 1933 and March 1934 unem-ployment fell by over 2 million in part but not
wholly due to the ending of recession. Able men
served Hitler, including the brilliant financialexpert, Hjalmar Schacht, whom the Führerappointed president of the Reichsbank. Plans
worked out in advance by Hitler’s economic
advisers were now put into action. With guaran-
teed prices for their produce, farmers recoveredduring the ﬁrst three years of the regime; smallbusinesses were helped with state spending; taxes
were reduced; grants were made to industry to
install new machinery; work was created in slum
clearance and housing and Autobahn construc-tion. The economy was stimulated out of reces-sion. Though wages did not rise in real terms,
security of employment was a greater beneﬁt for
the wage-earners. The pursuit of autarky or self-
sufﬁciency helped the construction, chemical, coal
and iron and steel industries. The industrialistswelcomed the opportunities for expansion andincreased proﬁt and applauded the destruction of
free trade unions. But industry lost its independ-
ence as its barons became dependent on stateorders and state allocation of resources. The Firstand Second Four-Year Plans imposed state con-trols severely limiting the capitalist economy.
Armament expenditure remained relatively low
from 1933 to 1935, but from then on was rapidly
increased, putting Germany on a war footing andeliminating unemployment. Belts had to be tight-ened, – ‘guns before butter’ – but it was too late
for any opposition to loosen the Nazi hold on
power; there was in any case no opposition that
could any longer command a mass following.By 1934 Hitler’s regime had established a suf-ﬁcient base of power and secured enough willingcooperation of ‘experts’ in the administration,
business and industry, as well as the army, for his
Nazi state to function, though often with much
confusion. The Nazi ideologues and fanatics hadformed an alliance with the educated and skilledwho served them. Without them the Nazis could
not have ruled Germany. What German history of
this period shows is that parliamentary democracy
and the rule of law, once established, will notinevitably continue. If they are not defended, theycan be destroyed – not only by violent revolution,
but more subtly by determined and ruthless men
adopting pseudo-legal tactics.And what of the outside world – they, too, notonly gave Hitler the concessions he demanded orunilaterally took by breaking treaties but in 1936handed him the spectacular triumph of holding
the Olympic Games, dedicated to freedom and
democracy, in Berlin.1THE FAILURE OF DEMOCRACY AND RISE OF HITLER, 1920–34193
It is often said that the Second World War beganin China in 1931. And that the global rise of
fascism ﬁrst blossomed into external aggression
when Japan attacked China; then the tide of war spread to Europe and Africa, to Abyssinia and Spain, until Hitler unleashed the Second
World War by marching into Poland in 1939.
Undeniably there was some interdependence of
European and Asian events in the 1930s. Britain
and the US were in a sense sandwiched betweenconﬂicts on the European continent and easternAsia, with vast interests bound up in the future of
both worlds, West and East. But to view the
earlier history of eastern Asia from the point of
view of the European war of 1939 is to see thathistory from a Western focus, and thus to distortit. The problems of eastern Asia were coming to
a head irrespective of the rise of fascism and
Nazism. The problems of Europe, too, had inde-
pendent roots.Seen through Japanese and Chinese eyesWestern policies appeared to change with confus-ing rapidity in the ﬁrst three decades of the twen-
tieth century. Conscious of their military and
industrial weakness in comparison with the West,
the Chinese and Japanese accordingly had to cal-culate how best to adapt to constantly shiftingexternal conditions. Critical, too, was the ques-
tion of what their relationship to each other
should be. All these problems arising from ‘mod-
ernisation’ and changing external and internalAsian relationships were to reach explosive inten-sity during the 1930s. The different strands canbe seen more clearly if separated.In Japan the orderly coherent structure ofnational government and decision-making beganto fall apart in 1930. Extremism and lawlessnessand a decentralisation of power occurred. Japan’s
disintegration was political and internal. In China
there was physical disintegration. No ‘govern-

ment’ of the ‘republic’ of China could rule the
whole vast country. Foreign control had beenestablished over China’s principal ports duringthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries and over
Manchuria, Outer Mongolia and Tibet. To add
to these setbacks Chiang Kai-shek and his
Kuomintang Party became involved in civil warafter breaking with the communists. Then therewere constant conﬂicts between the greater and
lesser warlords who ruled much of China as 
military-feudal commanders in the 1930s. Chiang
Kai-shek fought some of these warlords but 
was never strong enough to control them or their armies. Most made their peace with him,however, by assenting to nominal allegiance 
to him and his government of the Republic of
China, while continuing to rule independently
over their ﬁefs large and small.From 1928 to 1937, while Chiang Kai-shekestablished his capital and government in
Nanking, no unified Chinese Republic really
existed; his reforms had made an impact on urban
life but did not reach millions of peasants. Hisvision of a uniﬁed China bore no relationship toChapter 18THE MOUNTING CONFLICT IN EASTERNASIA, 1928–37reality. To the Western world he neverthelessembodied China; his ambassadors were accreditedto other countries and represented China at the
League of Nations in Geneva. Here it was that
Chiang Kai-shek sought to mobilise the help of
the Western powers when in 1931 the Japanesebegan transforming their special rights inManchuria into outright occupation and control
of the province. The issue appeared to be a simple
one for the Western powers of supporting the
League and China against Japanese aggression.
The contrast between the real condition of Chinaand its international legal position, together withits image in the eyes of the public in the Western
world, was one critical factor in the eastern Asia
crisis of the 1930s.The struggle between a central power claim-ing to speak for and to rule China and regionaland provincial rulers was nothing new in modern
Chinese history; the contest between integration
and disintegration had been going on for decades
and continued until 1949. China’s chronic weak-ness had allowed the European powers to estab-lish colonies and special rights in Shanghai and
other treaty ports. Since the beginning of the
century the Japanese leaders had been conscious
of a great divide in their options for a China
policy. Japan could identify with China as a fellowAsian nation and help it to achieve independencefrom the ‘white’ imperialists; or it could copy the
Western imperialists and join them in acquiring
colonial possessions and ‘spheres of inﬂuence’ in
China. To combine with China after dominatingit meant certain conﬂict with the more powerfulWestern powers. Japan’s best interests seemed to
be served by emulating the Western powers and
joining in the scramble for China. This meant
participating fully in Western great-power diplo-
macy, which Japan did when concluding analliance with Britain in 1902. Britain for its partwelcomed the Japanese alliance to check Russia
and to preserve its own position in China. After
the Russo-Japanese war three years later Japan
acquired its own considerable empire by annex-ing Korea and by replacing Russia and carving outa sphere of interest in southern Manchuria.
During the next ﬁfteen years the Japanese sought
to extend their inﬂuence in northern China inagreement with the Russians and at China’sexpense. The First World War gave Japan itsbiggest opportunity and for the first time its
ambition now encompassed controlling the gov-
ernment of China itself. But hostile Chinese and
international reactions forced the Japanese towithdraw from these extreme pretensions. Thiswas a blow. Worse was the army’s profitless
Siberian intervention from 1918 to 1922. It had
brought neither glory nor gain.The Japanese in the 1920s then appearedready to limit their empire to what they alreadyheld with the acknowledgement of the Westernpowers, and beyond this to work with the
Western powers within an agreed framework of
international treaties, military and territorial. At
the Washington Conference of 1921–2 thisframework was set up. Japan accepted an inferiorratio of battleships to Britain and the US (3:5:5),
but this inferiority was counterbalanced by the
agreement of Britain and the US not to build any
naval bases in the Western Pacific. Then theJapanese also signed the Nine-Power Treaty(1922) whereby the powers undertook ‘to respect
the sovereignty, the independence, and the terri-
torial and the administrative integrity of China’,
and not to take ‘advantage of conditions in
China’ to seek special rights or create ‘spheres ofinfluence’. But what of existing rights? TheWestern powers were not about to relinquish
their rights in Shanghai. Japan also interpreted
the treaty as not affecting its existing rights and
‘special interests’ which, the US had acknow-
ledged in the past, it should exercise wherever itsown territories were close to China’s.Since the opening of the twentieth century theUS had tried to secure the consent of the other
powers with interests in China to two proposi-
tions. First, they should allow equal economicopportunity to all foreign nations wishing to tradein China (the Open Door). The behaviour of the
foreign nations, however, showed that this ‘equal
opportunity’ was not extended to the Chinese
themselves, who did not exercise sovereign powerover all Chinese territory. Second, the US urgedthat China should not be further partitioned
(respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity),
but in practice the US had acknowledged Japan’s1THE MOUNTING CONFLICT IN EASTERN ASIA, 1928–37195
special rights and spheres of influence. Thesecond proposition was more a moral hope thanreal politics. Nevertheless, these principles were
not abandoned. They were reasserted in the
1920s and 1930s.For Japan, the Washington treaties of 1921–2stabilised international conduct towards disinte-grating China and lessened the chance of conﬂict
with the Western powers. Japan would now main-
tain its existing rights against a new possible
threat, Bolshevik Russia, without fear of conﬂict
with Britain and the US. A third reason forJapan’s peaceful adaptation to the entirely newpost-war world was its inability to compete in a
naval race with the US. Japanese ﬁnances were
exhausted. Japan was dependent on the West to
a degree matched by few modern nations. Itscapacity to modernise was at the mercy of theWestern powers, especially the US. A Japanese
journalist in 1929 summed up Japan’s position,
reﬂecting views widely held at the time:Japan is a country whose territory is small andwhose resources are scarce. It has to depend
upon other countries for securing such mater-
ials. Furthermore, to sustain the livelihood of
its excessive population, Japan ﬁnds it impera-
tive to place a high priority upon exporting itsproducts abroad.The worldwide depression hit Japan less seriouslythan the West. Japan had an industrious and well-
organised people to further economic progress.With the help of a large devaluation of its cur-rency, it had pulled out of the slump by 1932.
But now the need for capital, especially from 
the US, and for raw materials (cotton, coal, iron
ore and oil) from abroad became increasingly
essential. The Japanese believed that their owncontinued economic existence, the ability of the nation to progress, depended on develop-
ing the resources of Manchuria (where the
Japanese could secure some of the raw materials
they needed) and on continued access to theAmerican market. The heavy rearmament pro-
gramme launched in 1936 and the needs of the
military in China, moreover, could not be sus-
tained without American imports of scrap metaland oil. Thus, the poverty of resources wasJapan’s Achilles heel.Recognition of this weakness united theJapanese leadership in the military, business,
diplomacy, bureaucracy and politics in one aim:
that Japan had to maintain its economic empirein China. Four-ﬁfths of all Japan’s overseas invest-ment at the close of 1929 was in China. On the
importance of China there was no difference
between the ‘paciﬁc’ 1920s and the militaristic
1930s. The rift occurred between the leaders who
argued that Japan could achieve this while stayingwithin the legal framework of treaties and con-cessions held in common with the West, and
those who wished to extend the Japanese eco-
nomic empire not only at China’s expense but
regardless too of Western economic interests inChina. The whole of eastern Asia and south-eastern Asia would become a Japanese-dominated
empire serving Japan’s interests under the high-
sounding guise of a cooperative Japanese com-
monwealth of Asian nations called the GreaterAsia Co-prosperity Sphere. Foreign MinisterMatsuoka of the later 1930s, looking at Western
behaviour with its earlier emphasis on imperialism
and its later support for the League of Nations,
simply derided it as a cynical way of changing the
rules of international law to suit the West’s ownselﬁsh interests. ‘The Western Powers had taughtthe Japanese the game of poker’, he once
remarked, but then, ‘after acquiring most of the
chips they pronounced the game immoral and
took up contract bridge.’One significant strand in Japanese thinkingabout the world was the belief that only by its own
endeavours would Japan be accepted as an equal
of the ‘white’ world powers, which did not treat it
as an equal. It was still in the process of catching
up militarily and industrially with the leadingWestern nations; to survive among the worldpowers it must grow in strength or go under.
Since the days of Meiji, Japan, for all its later talk
of Asian cooperation against the West, did not
seek a new role as the leading anti-imperialistnation; it wanted to join the imperialist powersand foresaw a partition of the whole world among
them. In that partition Japan and its empire would
dominate Asia. Now inevitably this set Japan on a196THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
collision course with Western possessions and economic interests in Asia. Against the Europeanimperialist nations, Japan, though weaker than
their combined strength, had a chance of success.
Just as the weaker US in the eighteenth century
had made itself dominant in the Western hemi-sphere – a parallel not lost on Japan – by takingadvantage of Europe’s distress, of Europe’s great
internecine wars, so Japan in the twentieth century
would proﬁt from the conﬂicts of Europe. But
unlike in the eighteenth century, there was one
great power now outside the European continent.The fulfilment of Japanese ambitions came todepend on the US.American policy in Asia in the twentieth centuryhas been beset by confusion and contradictions.Paradoxically, one basic tenet of American policy– to uphold the unity and national independence
of China in the face of Japanese and European
ambitions of piecemeal territorial partition – tri-
umphed in 1949 with the communist victory. Forthe ﬁrst time in the century the Chinese mainlandwas then fused into national unity. What the
Americans had always maintained, that China
rightly belonged to the Chinese, had come about.
China was set on the road to joining the world’s
great nations. Only a vestigial presence remainedof the former Western imperial era – PortugueseMacao and British Hong Kong – and both out-
posts were returned to full Chinese control by the
end of the century. The Chinese became masters
of their own internal economic development,their trading relations and their policy towards theoutside world. The fulﬁlment of the Americans’
objectives was followed by more than two decades
of bitter dispute between the US and China,
including war in Korea. One reason for past ambi-
guities in US policy was that it was rooted in thegenuine desire for eventual Chinese unity on the one hand and equal commercial opportunities
for all Western powers on the other. During the
1920s and 1930s the US was determined to par-
ticipate in a share of China’s market, whosepotential was believed to be of critical importancefor future Western prosperity.In 1930 American investment in China, con-
centrated in Shanghai, was less than Americaninvestment in Japan. The Japanese had alsoacquired rights and privileges, especially in south-
ern Manchuria, based on the Japanese control of
the south Manchurian railway and the concessions
that went with it. But these rights in Manchuria
could not compare with the outright colonial pos-
sessions of the European powers acquired by forcefrom a weak China in the nineteenth century, or
the semi-colonial ‘extra-territorial rights’ which
the Europeans and Japanese enjoyed in the treaty
ports. In southern Manchuria, Japanese control
was not absolute but had to be attained by manip-
ulating China’s difﬁculties and working through
the local Manchurian warlord. Thus, what came to
be regarded as the ‘nation’s lifeline’ was threatened
by chaotic conditions and the internal conﬂicts of

China. The Japanese in the 1920s consideredChina’s claims to Manchuria to be purely nominal,arguing that without Japan’s defeat of Russia
Manchuria would have been annexed by Russia in
1905 and that Japan’s presence in Manchuria for a
quarter of a century had ensured peace there. Thatwas not the view of the US, which upheld China’ssovereignty over Manchuria; it should be preserved
for a future time when China had overcome its
internal problems.But successive American presidents fromTheodore to Franklin Roosevelt never contem-plated the possibility that America’s commercialor strategic interests were sufficiently large in
China to justify the US’s defending them by force
of arms and so risking war with Japan. It was not
in defence of American interests in China that thePaciﬁc War of 1941 to 1945 was fought. ForFranklin Roosevelt much wider and more funda-
mental issues were at stake. These were based on
American ideological assumptions which were
neither shared nor understood in Japan. The fas-
cinating account of American–Japanese relationsfrom 1939 to 1941 needs to be related laterwhere it belongs chronologically.With the onset of the depression after 1927,Japan was beset by additional problems. Thoughindustry recovered more quickly than elsewherein the world, the farmers suffered severely. The
domestic silk industry provided an important
additional income for the peasantry and the price1THE MOUNTING CONFLICT IN EASTERN ASIA, 1928–37197
of silk plunged in the US. The countrysidebecame the breeding ground for militarism. Astrident nationalism, a sort of super Japanese
patriotism with a return to emperor-worship,
marks the 1930s. It uniﬁed most of the Japanese
people. Harsh repression in any case ensuredbroad conformity, and the educational system wasgeared to uphold military national values. The
more ‘liberal’ tendencies of the 1920s, which saw
a strengthening of the Diet, of political parties, of
the inﬂuence of big business (the zaibatsu) onpolitics, of the civilian politicians as against themilitary, was engulfed by the new militaristicnationalism.All these changes occurred without any formalchanges in the Meiji constitution. It had never
been a part of that constitution to guarantee per-sonal liberties and thereby to limit the powers ofthe state. Whenever necessary, censorship and
control were instituted. The Japanese were taught
to obey the state, and patriotism centred on the
veneration of the emperor. But it was characteris-tic of formal Japanese institutions and laws thatthey allowed for ﬂexibility. The fount of all power,
however, remained the emperor. Whichever
group succeeded in speaking in his name could
wrap itself in his unchallengeable authority. The
Meiji Emperor had taken a real role in the deci-sions of crucial national policies on the advice ofhis elder statesmen, the genro. The position of hissuccessors was weaker. Emperor Hirohito was ele-
vated to an object of worship and, as a god, was
thereby moved away from practical inﬂuence onnational affairs. Temperamentally gentle andscholarly, the emperor followed rather than
controlled the tide of events.Despite the introduction of male suffrage,Japan was not about to turn into a parliamentary
constitutional state in the 1920s. Its uniqueness asa society, blending emperor-worship and author-ity with elected institutions, was not essentially
changed by any democratic demands. A Peace
Preservation Law imposed severe prison penalties
on anyone who even advocated such a change. Sothe description of the 1920s as the years of TaishoDemocracy is a misnomer. The people were not
prepared or encouraged to think that they should
decide the policies of the state through theirelected parties in the parliament. Thus the politicalparties had no real roots and were the easy victimsof military reaction in the 1930s.There was a real difference between the poli-cies pursued by the Japanese in the 1920s and
those followed in the 1930s due to the change ofbalance among the groups that exercised powerin the state. The army and navy were not subject
to the control of the government but, through
the right of separate access to the emperor, con-
stituted a separate position of power. The infor-
mal genrohad coordinated civilian and militaryaspects of national affairs. With the passing of theoriginal genrothrough the deaths of its members,no other body advising the emperor was ever
again able to exercise such undisputed overall
control. The civilian politicians, leaning forsupport on parliament and backed by some mod-erates in the army and navy, in the 1920s gained
the upper hand over the more extreme ofﬁcers in
the navy and army. It found expression in
Shidehara’s foreign policy and especially in thenaval disarmament treaties of the WashingtonConference. But both in the Kwantung army sta-
tioned in Manchuria and in the navy a violent
reaction to civilian control was forming.From 1928 until 1936 the leadership groupswere caught in cross-currents of violent conﬂict.They were no longer able to provide a uniﬁedJapanese policy. So there is the contrast between
the outwardly uniﬁed nation embodied in the
emperor’s supremacy and the breakdown of gov-
ernment culminating in the assassination of thosepoliticians who had fallen foul of nationalistextremists. The army was no longer under uniﬁed
control. The army command in Tokyo was rent
by conspiracies to encourage the Kwantung army
to act on its own in Manchuria regardless of the
policy of the government. In 1928 the Kwantungarmy attempted to seize military control overManchuria and so to anticipate Chiang Kai-shek’s
attempts to extend his rule by conquest or diplo-
macy. Chiang Kai-shek might decide to strike a
deal with the Manchurian warlord at the expenseof Japan’s ambitions. The Japanese Kwantungarmy command organised the warlord’s murder
by blowing up the train on which he was travel-
ling. Although at the time there was an aggres-198THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
sive Japanese government in power ready to usemilitary force in China to prevent northern Chinafrom falling under Chiang Kai-shek’s control, the
Kwantung army had overreached itself and its
attempt to take over Manchuria was disavowed.
The murdered warlord’s son took over control ofthe Chinese Manchurian administration andarmy. A more moderate Japanese government
came to power in 1929 and the paciﬁc Shidehara
returned to the Foreign Ministry. The army
smarted under its humiliation. But the Kwantung
army was not punished – the colonel in commandwas merely retired – and two years later, inSeptember 1931, it struck again more effectively.Meanwhile the new Cabinet of Prime MinisterHamaguchi was soon involved in a confrontation
with the navy. The government had consented toa new treaty of naval limitation at the LondonConference of 1930, this time applying to cruis-
ers. The Japanese navy had not secured the ratio
of cruisers that the chief of the naval general staff,
Admiral Kato Kanji, and those naval officers who supported him, considered indispensable.The navy minister, another admiral, supported
the prime minister, who won after months of
bitter debate.The split into factions even within the armedservices themselves is illustrated by this wholeepisode. It ended tragically when a nationalistfanatic shot Hamaguchi, who lingered several
months before succumbing to his wounds.In September 1931 the insubordination of theKwantung garrison army in Manchuria attractedthe attention of the world. Its plot to seizeManchuria by force from theoretical Chinese
suzerainty and the warlord’s actual control was an
ill-kept secret. The government in Tokyo was
powerless. Shidehara received worthless assur-
ances from the war minister that the plot wouldbe quashed. In fact, there was sympathy withinthe army general staff for the plotters. During 
the night of 18 and 19 September the Japanese
themselves blew up the tracks of the South
Manchurian Railway just outside Mukden inManchuria. On this ﬂimsy pretext the Kwantungarmy attacked the Chinese and occupied Mukden.
The Japanese army in Korea now concerted with
the Kwantung army, and units crossed intoManchuria. Soon the whole of Manchuria wasunder military administration.If this action had been the work of only the middle-ranking subordinate officers of the
Kwantung army, then the government in Tokyo
might have re-established its authority. The con-spiracy at Mukden extended to the army leader-ship in Tokyo. Government was disintegrating.
Shidehara tried to hide this fact from the outside
world and to make the diplomatic best of it. The
difﬁculty that Shidehara and the politicians, sup-
ported by big business, faced was also in part self-made. While they strongly disapproved of thearmies’ insubordination and interference in
politics, as well as their resort to force, they held
in common with the army the belief in Japan’s
China destiny. The army was pursuing essentiallythe same goals as they. Only their means differed.Internally the army was out of control and fol-lowed its own policy of solving Japan’s China
policy by force. In February 1932 it set up a
puppet state which it called Manchukuo and sodeclared that Manchuria was severed fromChinese sovereignty. Then it placed the last boy
emperor of the ousted Manchu dynasty, with the
unlikely name of Henry Pu-yi, on the puppet
throne. Possibly the motive for this bizarre move
was to have a useful symbol under their controlwho might be put forward as a Japanese-backedemperor of China. During the next few years the
army’s ambitions were not limited to securing
Japan’s rights in southern Manchuria. The
Kwantung army was soon extending Japaneseinfluence beyond Manchuria, which was com-pletely conquered by 1933. The Great Wall, the
ancient traditional defensive boundary which the
Chinese had built to keep out the northern bar-
barians, proved no barrier to the Japanese. The
Japanese army crossed the Great Wall along therailway line running from Mukden in Manchuriato Peking.Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist government was far too weak to oppose the Kwantung army
by force. In many provinces warlords persisted inexercising power and the communists, from thebases they had established, disputed the Kuomin-
tang’s right to speak for and unite China.
Resistance against Japan would be hopeless unless1THE MOUNTING CONFLICT IN EASTERN ASIA, 1928–37199
China could ﬁrst be effectively united, and thisbecame Chiang Kai-shek’s priority. He was there-fore glad of a truce, which the Japanese were
ready to conclude with the Nationalist govern-
ment in May 1933. Chiang Kai-shek concen-
trated his forces against the communist strong-hold in the south, to crush peasant uprisings and the Red Army. He almost succeeded in the
autumn of 1934. But the Red Army broke
through the encircling Nationalist armies and set
out on the epic Long March, a military manoeu-
vre without parallel in the annals of history. TheRed Army and the communist political andadministrative cadres, about 50,000 people in all,
sought safety from the pursuing Nationalist forces
by walking a long circuitous route to the last sur-
viving communist base in the north-west ofChina. They had to ﬁght all the way. The distancethat this army covered, through mountains and
swamps, in heat and freezing cold, was almost
6,000 miles. The Long March took just over a
year to accomplish and of the 80,000 who hadset out possibly only 9,000 reached Yan’an inShaanxi in October 1935, though others joined
on the way. In this province Mao Zedong then
rebuilt the Communist movement from an initial
nucleus of 20,000 to the eventual millions that
drove Chiang Kai-shek’s armies from the main-land in 1949.The Kwantung army meanwhile was not idle.It was rapidly expanded from 10,000 ofﬁcers and
men in 1931 to 164,000 in 1935 and by 1941 it
had reached a strength of 700,000. These ﬁguresalone provide a graphic illustration of the escala-tion of Japan’s military effort in China. Chiang
Kai-shek did not declare war on the Japanese; nor
did the Tangku truce in May 1933 between the
Nationalist Chinese and the Japanese stop the
Kwantung army. By the end of 1935 large regionsof northern China and Inner Mongolia wereoccupied. This brought the Japanese army into
contact with the Soviet Union along hundreds of
miles of new frontier. The Kwantung army
regarded Soviet Russia as the real menace toJapan’s aspirations in eastern Asia: Russia alonecould put a modern army of millions into the ﬁeld
of battle on land. The Japanese disregarded the
Chinese as a serious military force. But justbecause there were no real obstacles to expansionin China, it was difﬁcult for the army general staffto decide where to stop. They argued that the war
in China should be limited so that the army could
concentrate on the Soviet Union. Other ofﬁcers
wanted ﬁrst to expand in China. It was the latterwho won out in July 1937 when a clash of localChinese and Japanese troops on the Marco Polo
Bridge outside Peking became the Japanese
excuse for launching full-scale war.Chiang Kai-shek had used the years from 1933 to1937 to consolidate the power of the Kuomintangin the rest of China with some success. But the
Western image of republican Chinese democracy
was removed from reality. Chiang’s regime was
totalitarian, with its own gangs and terror policeand an army held together by fear and harsh disci-pline. Supported by intellectuals as the only rally-
ing point for anti-Japanese resistance, and by big
business and the landlords as the bulwark against
communism, Chiang ruled the country throughharshness and corruption. The peasantry were theprincipal and most numerous victims. Chiang
prided himself on having copied techniques of
government from Mussolini and Hitler. German
military advisers were attached to his army. He
also cultivated American friendship by his attitudeto business and his welcome to American educa-tors and missionaries. The achievements of the
Kuomintang in modernising China during a
decade of reforms from 1928 to 1937 also should
not be overlooked. Industry grew, communica-tions improved, new agricultural techniques raisedproduce, education was extended. The cities ben-
eﬁted the most. Tens of millions of peasants, how-
ever, remained sunk in abject poverty. Further
progress in modernising and unifying China was
terminated by the all-out war launched by Japan in1937.The educated elite, in particular, displayed asense of national pride in the face of internal con-
ﬂicts and foreign aggression. Trade boycotts were
organised against the Japanese and studentsdemonstrated. Groups argued that the Kuomin-tang and the communists should form a new
united front to ﬁght the Japanese. Chiang Kai-
shek’s priority, however, was to follow Mao to 200THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
the base he had recently set up in Yenan andsmash the ‘bandits’, before turning to meet theJapanese aggression. He sent Zhang Xueliang,
called the Young Marshal, to Xi’an in the
province of Shensi with the intention that he
should march his troops to Yenan and liquidatethe communist stronghold. What happened thenis one of the most astonishing episodes in the
Chinese war. The Young Marshal installed in
Xi’an with his army had ideas of his own. Mao
skilfully undermined his loyalty to Chiang Kai-
shek appealing to him to make common frontagainst the Japanese. The Young Marshal thenlooked for allies and sought the support of the
powerful warlord in the neighbouring Shansi
province; he found him guarded but not unsym-
pathetic. When in October 1936 Chiang Kai-shekleft Nanking and ﬂew to Xi’an to rally the gener-als against the communist ‘traitors’ the response
was lukewarm. So in early December 1936
Chiang Kai-shek returned to Xi’an hoping for
better success.The Young Marshal now brought matters to ahead. He probably saw himself as replacing
Chiang Kai-shek in a united national movement
against the Japanese who were starting a full-scale
military drive in the north. On 12 December the
Young Marshal’s troops stormed Chiang’s head-quarters just outside Xi’an, killed many of hisbodyguards and took Chiang Kai-shek himself
captive. Two weeks later he was released and
allowed to ﬂy back to Nanking. He owed his
release, and possibly his life, to the interventionof Mao Zedong. It was an extraordinary turn ofevents. Mao had received a telegram from
Moscow conveying Stalin’s advice that Mao
should form a united front with Chiang Kai-shek
against the Japanese. Mao sent Zhou Enlai to
Xi’an to negotiate, to propose that the commu-nists unite in the ﬁght against the Japanese withChiang Kai-shek and to offer to subordinate their
forces. Zhou Enlai also persuaded the Young
Marshal that Chiang Kai-shek was the only pos-
sible leader of a ‘united’ China. A formal com-munist offer in February 1937 was not ofﬁciallyaccepted by Chiang Kai-shek, but the military
effort of the Kuomintang did switch to resisting
the Japanese.As for the Young Marshal, he was arrested andimprisoned. But the ‘Xi’an incident’ did mark thebeginning of cooperation at least in theory
between the Kuomintang and Mao’s communist
forces. After the Japanese had resumed a full-scale
war in the summer of 1937, the two sides reached
agreement that the 30,000 soldiers of the Chinese
Red Army should become the Eighth Route
Army under nominal Kuomintang control. It was
not a union of spirit, but a tactical move on both
fronts and Mao retained control of the commu-
nist base areas.Of all the Western powers, Britain had most atstake in China. Its total trade and commercialinvestment in China were very large in 1930, justexceeding Japan’s. Together, Britain and Japan
dominated all foreign investment in China,
accounting for 72 per cent of the total. The US’s
investment was far behind at 6 per cent, about
the same as France’s. No other power had any
signiﬁcant investment. The most sensitive point
of Western interests and inﬂuence was the great
city of Shanghai. The Western powers and the
Japanese held ‘concessions’ there which virtually
removed the heart of the city and its port from
Chinese control. In January 1932 the Japanese
bombed the Chinese district, army reinforce-
ments attacked the Chinese parts of Shanghai,meeting ﬁerce resistance from a Chinese army.The conﬂict in China was now brought hometo the ordinary people in the West. For the ﬁrst
time the cinema newsreels showed the effects of
modern warfare. People were horriﬁed by the suf-
ferings inﬂicted on civilian populations and by the
terror bombing from Japanese planes on the
hapless Chinese. This new image of war, which
was to become even more familiar after the out-
break of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, had a
tremendous impact on public opinion. It pro-

duced contradictory currents. It provoked a revul-
sion against war, thus underpinning later attempts
at conciliating Hitler in Europe. The public alsoidentiﬁed with the sufferers and therefore castattackers in the role of aggressors to be stopped.
China was seen as the innocent victim. The
Japanese did incalculable harm to their cause by1THE MOUNTING CONFLICT IN EASTERN ASIA, 1928–37201
adopting such a ruthless style of warfare withinthe range of Western cameramen.When the League of Nations met to considerChina’s appeal immediately after the Japanese
launched their operation in Manchuria, public
opinion in the West sided with China. There was
an element of wishful thinking that the League ofNations would be able to punish the aggressor byusing the machinery of sanctions set up to provide
for collective security. Governments were urged
to support the League. But the League of Nations
could not fulﬁl such unrealistic expectations. Tooppose Japan by military force on the Chinesemainland would have required an enormous mil-
itary effort. Who would be ready in the midst of
deep depression to raise and supply the large
armies? Alternatively, by a great effort and with
large funds the Chinese armies might be betterequipped and led. Germany was doing all it couldin providing military advice to Chiang Kai-shek’s
forces. The political divisions of China, however,
made it difﬁcult in 1932 and 1933 to conceive of
any effective check on Japan.The British Foreign Ofﬁce and the American
State Department had a more realistic appreciation
of the situation. With so much at stake, the British
attitude to Japan was ambiguous. Chinese nation-

alism threatened Britain’s imperialist interests as
much as Japan’s. In the US it was clear from thestart that American material interests were not suf-
ﬁcient to justify the possibility of conﬂict with

Japan or even a trade embargo, which would have
deeply injured Japan. That remained the view of
ofﬁcial America throughout the 1930s. Yet therewas a genuine sense of outrage that Japan hadoffended against the ethical code that should dic-

tate how it was to conduct its relations with neigh-

bours. It had broken solemn treaties, and this was
to be condemned. Secretary of State HenryStimson issued a famous statement on 7 January1932 that became known as the Stimson Doctrine
– much to President Hoover’s chagrin since, he
claimed, he had ﬁrst thought of it. The US, it

declared, would not recognise any treaties or situ-

ations brought about in violation of earlier treaties.The US thus refused to accept all Japaneseattempts to regularise its control of Manchuria.
The League endorsed this view a little later.Meanwhile, the League of Nations had sentLord Lytton as British chairman of a commissionto investigate on the spot Chinese claims and
Japanese counter-claims. His report in October
1932 condemned the Japanese military action 
and suggested a compromise solution that wouldhave given Manchuria autonomy while preserv-ing Japanese rights. In February 1933 these rec-
ommendations were accepted by the League
Assembly; the Japanese delegation thereupon left
the League and never returned. The League of
Nations had nothing more to offer in the absenceof will on the part of Britain and the US to backfurther action. The League suffered greatly in
prestige. This, in itself, did not bring a general
war between the other powers nearer; indeed, it
might have served a useful purpose if the peoplesin the democratic countries had thereby gained agreater sense of realism. Too often the call to
‘support the League’ was believed to be all that
was required; it could be comfortably combined
with paciﬁsm and a refusal to ‘ﬁght for king andcountry’. Many preferred to believe that they didnot need to shoulder the responsibilities of peace-
keeping or make the sacriﬁces required to check
aggression – that was the job of the League. An
ardent desire for peace and wishful thinking led
to blame being transferred to the League.In Japan itself the success of the Kwantungarmy and the failure of the League had import-
ant effects too. A wave of patriotism and ultra-
nationalism swept the population. Japanese
governments now seemed to those Japanese patri-ots much too cautious. Patriotic secret societies,with sometimes only a few hundred members,
sought to inﬂuence policy decisively. One method
was to assassinate ministers who, in the societies’
view, did not follow patriotic policies. Frustrated
army ofﬁcers joined such societies and there wererepeated attempts to stage military coups. Severalprominent ministers were murdered. This reign of
terror did succeed in intimidating many oppo-
nents of extremism. The army meanwhile did not
try to put its own house in order – at least notuntil several hundred officers and rebellioustroops in February 1936 had seized the whole
government quarter of Tokyo and assassinated a
number of Cabinet ministers, in the name of the202THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
emperor. The Japanese navy now played a leading part in putting down the insurrection. But it proved no victory for moderation. From then
on, civilian ministers came to be even more
dominated by the military. Japan was set on an
expansionist course. Although Britain and the USdid not wish to ﬁght Japan, in the last resort the issue of peace with the West would dependon whether Japan’s aims in China were limited 
or whether ambition would drive it on to seek to
destroy all Western influence in eastern and
southern Asia.1THE MOUNTING CONFLICT IN EASTERN ASIA, 1928–37203
In chess what matters is the result, the endgame.The opening moves and the middle play are alldirected to achieving such a superiority of posi-tion that the endgame is preordained, the anni-
hilation of the opponent. The analogy holds for
Hitler’s foreign policy. Much confusion of inter-
pretation is avoided if one essential point is
grasped: Hitler never lost sight of his goal – warsof conquest that would smash Soviet Russia, andsubordinate France and the smaller states of the
continent of Europe to the domination of a new
Germany. This new order would be based on the
concept of race. ‘Races’ such as the Jews were sopoisonous that there was literally no place forthem in this new Europe. Other inferior races
would be handled ruthlessly: the Slavs unless they
sided with Hitler would not be permitted any
national existence and could only hope for aservile status under their Aryan masters. Logically,this biological foreign policy could not be con-
ﬁned to Europe alone. From the mastery of the
European continent, the global conﬂict would
ensue. Hitler was vague about details; this would
be a task for his successors and future generations.But he took some interest in German relationswith Japan in the 1930s because he recognised
that Japan’s war in Asia and threat to British
interests could be exploited. He preferred to con-
centrate on the ‘limited’ task of gaining masteryof the European continent.It is interesting to compare Hitler’s aims withthose of his Weimar and Wilhelmine predecessors.The desire for predominance on the continent ofEurope was shared by both Wilhelmine Germanyin 1914 and Hitler’s Germany of the 1930s. Theforeign policy of Weimar’s Germany, like Hitler’s
included secret rearmament and the objective of
restoring German military power by abolishing
the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of
Versailles. Furthermore, Weimar’s foreign policywas ultimately directed towards recovering theterritories lost to Poland. Differences between
Hitler’s policy and earlier policies are also very
evident. Wilhelmine Germany was brought to the
point of launching war only after years of tryingto avoid such a war. An alternative to war wasalways considered both possible and desirable.
War would become unnecessary if the alliance
between France and Russia ‘encircling’ Germany
could have been broken by the threat of forcealone. Even when Wilhelmine Germany madepeace plans in the autumn of 1914 in the ﬂush of
early victories, the German leaders did not con-
template the enslavement of peoples or mass
murder. Wilhelmine Germany’s vision was a
utopian one of a prosperous Europe led by a pow-erful Germany. Of course what appeared as utopiato the German leaders, a Pax Germanica, was
intolerable to its neighbours.When we next contrast Hitler’s aims with those of Stresemann the differences are equallygreat. Weimar Germany was not bent on eitherracialist barbarism or continental domination. The
reconciliation with France was genuine, as wasChapter 19THE CRUMBLING PEACE, 1933–6Stresemann’s assumption that another Europeanwar with France and Britain would spell Ger-
many’s ruin. A realistic objective, he believed, was
for Germany to recover the position it had held as
a great power before 1914. To strive for more was
to make the mistake that had led other powers tocombine against imperial Germany and so hadbrought about the catastrophic defeat of Ger-
many and the harsh peace. The essence then of
Stresemann’s diplomacy was to win as much for
Germany as possible without provoking the slight-
est chance of war. It followed that this ‘weapon’was to make repeated pleas for trust and reconcil-iation. He conducted Weimar’s diplomacy with
skill and success, overcoming many difﬁculties.
Tragically, it was Hitler who became the heir of
Germany’s much improved international position;furthermore, he derided Weimar’s achievementsas the work of the ‘November criminals’.It is commonplace since the publication of A. J. P. Taylor’s The Origins of the Second WorldWarto discredit the ﬁndings of the NürnbergWar Crimes Tribunal that Hitler and his associ-ates carefully and precisely planned their aggres-
sions culminating in the attack on Poland in
September 1939. It is true that Hitler was fol-
lowing no such precise and detailed plan of
aggression. He clearly reacted to events and, asthe documents show, was ready at times to beﬂexible when it came to timing and detail. After
all he could not disregard contemporary circum-
stances or the policies of the other powers, nor
could he foretell what opportunities would arisefor Germany to exploit.But all this does not lead to the opposite con-clusion that he had no plan. No one can read
Mein Kampf, or his other writings and the exist-ing documents expressing his views, without
being struck by their general consistency. Hisactions, moreover, conformed to the broad planshe laid down. This was no mere coincidence.
Unlike his predecessors, Hitler was working
towards one clear goal: a war, or several wars,
which would enable Germany to conquer thecontinent of Europe. Once a dictator has acquiredsufﬁcient power internally there is nothing difﬁ-
cult about launching a war. The difﬁculty lies in
winning it, and in getting right the timing ofaggression. The task of preserving peace, ofsolving conﬂicts, of deciding when war cannot beavoided because of the ambitions and aggressions
of other nations – that requires skill and good
judgement. Hitler was not prepared to compro-
mise his ultimate goal. Only to a very limiteddegree, was he prepared to modify the steps bywhich he intended to attain this goal. Hitler
showed a greater degree of skill as a propagandist
by hiding his true objectives for a time when in
power. His repeated assurances that he was
making his ‘last territorial demands’ fooled somepeople abroad, as well as the majority of Germans,who certainly did not imagine they would be led
again into another war against Britain, France,
Russia and the US.Why were Hitler and resurgent Germany notstopped before German power had become soformidable that it was too late, except at the cost
of a devastating war? There can be little doubt
that British and French policy between the wars
and, more especially, in the 1930s was disastrous.But the real interest of these years lies in the con-trast between a single-minded Hitler bent on a
war of conquest from the start and the reaction
of his neighbours who were uncertain of his ulti-
mate intentions, who had to grapple with the
problem of how best to meet ill-deﬁned dangersabroad, while facing economic and social difﬁcul-ties at home. The leaders of the Western democ-
racies, moreover, were incessantly concerned with
the problems of domestic political rivalries and
divisions within their own parties. In France polit-ical divisions had escalated into violence andgreatly weakened the capacity of unstable gov-
ernments to respond decisively to the German
danger. In the circumstances it is perhaps all the
more remarkable that a real attempt on the level
of diplomacy was made by the French to checkHitler. In Britain, despite the overwhelming par-liamentary strength won by the nationalist gov-
ernment in 1931, continuing widespread distress
and unemployment gave the Conservatives much
cause for concern from an electoral point of view.Foreign policy also played a considerable role in the November election of 1935. Baldwin
reflected the public mood by simultaneously
expressing Conservative support for the League of1THE CRUMBLING PEACE, 1933–6205
Nations while reassuring the electorate that therewould be no extensive rearmament. After anotherelectoral victory in 1935, almost as massive as the
1931 landslide, the Conservatives had most to
fear from their own supporters, and from one in
particular, Winston Churchill, who from thebackbenches constantly attacked the govern-
ment’s weak response to German rearmament.When, on coming to power, Hitler acceleratedGerman rearmament in deﬁance of the Versailles
Treaty, he was in fact taking no real risk. The lack
of effective Allied reaction during the period from1933 to 1935 was not due to the ﬁnesse of Hitleror of his diplomats, nor even to Hitler’s decep-
tive speeches proclaiming his peaceful intentions.
The brutal nature of the Nazi regime in Germany
revealed itself quite clearly to the world with theaccounts of beatings and concentration camps,reinforced by the exodus of distinguished, mainly
Jewish, refugees. Britain tolerated Hitler’s illegal
actions just as rearmament in the Weimar years
had been accepted. France, though more alarmedthan Britain by the development of German mil-itary strength, would not take action without the
certainty of British support in case such actions
should lead to war with Germany. But until 1939
British governments refused to back France unless
France herself were attacked by Germany. TheFrench army would have been much strongerthan Germany’s in 1933 and 1934 at the outset
of any war, but France’s military and industrial
potential for war was weaker.The weakness of the French response was notwholly due to the defensive military strategy sym-bolised by the great Maginot fortress line. The
French had reached a conclusion diametrically
opposite to the Germans. The French did not
believe that a lightning strike by its own armies,
before Germany had a chance to mobilise itsgreater manpower and industry for war, couldbring rapid victory. In short, the French aban-
doned the notion of a limited punitive military
action such as they had undertaken in the Ruhr
ten years earlier. Any military response, so theFrench high command advised the governmentsof the day, could lead to general war; there-
fore, it could not be undertaken without prior
mobilisation placing France on a war footing.This left the French governments with no alter-native but diplomacy, aimed at aligning alliesagainst Germany in order to exert pressure in time
of peace. But no British government was prepared
to face another war unless Britain’s own national
interests were clearly imperilled.This nexus between the rejection of any limitedmilitary response and Britain’s and France’s per-
fectly understandable desire to avoid outright 
war unless there was an attack on their territories,
or a clear threat of one, made possible Hitler’s
rake’s progress of treaty violations and aggressionsuntil the serious crisis over Czechoslovakia inSeptember 1938. All Hitler required was the nerve
to seize where there would be no resistance. He
had only to push against open doors.A disarmament conference under the auspices ofthe League was proceeding in Geneva when
Hitler came to power. It served as a useful smoke-
screen for the Nazis. The Germans argued a
seemingly reasonable case. It was up to the otherpowers to disarm to Germany’s level, or Germanyshould be allowed to rearm to theirs. The French
could never willingly give their blessing to this
proposition, so they were placed in the position
of appearing to be the unreasonable power,
blocking the progress of negotiations which theBritish wished to succeed for they had nostomach for increasing armaments expenditure in
the depth of the depression. The British argued
that some agreement, allowing but limiting
German rearmament, was better than none.The French, however, refused to consent toGerman rearmament. In fact, it made no differ-
ence whether the British or the French policy was
pursued. In April 1933 the German delegate to
the disarmament negotiations confidentially
briefed German journalists, telling them that,while Germany hoped to secure the consent ofthe other powers to a standing army of 600,000,
it was building the army up to this size anyway.
Hitler was giving rearmament first priority,
regardless of the attitude of other nations, thoughany cover which Anglo-French disagreementsgave for his own treaty violations was naturally
welcome to him. In June 1933 he happily signed
a four-power treaty proposed by Mussolini which206THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
bound Britain, France, Germany and Italy, in nomore than platitudes of goodwill, to consult witheach other within the framework of the League.In Germany, meanwhile, a National DefenceCouncil had been secretly set up in April 1933 to
coordinate military planning. It would take timeto build up the necessary infrastructure – to setup and equip factories to manufacture large quan-
tities of tanks, planes and the weapons of mech-
anised warfare. The lack of swift early progress
was an inherent problem of complex modern
rearmament, as Britain was to discover to its costlater on. Financial responsibility for providing theregime with all the credit it needed belonged 
to Hjalmar Schacht, who was appointed head of
the Reichsbank by Hitler when the incumbent
showed reluctance to abandon orthodox ﬁnan-cial practice. Hitler in February 1933 secretlyexplained to the army generals and to the Nazi
elite that the solution to Germany’s problems
could be found only in the conquest of territory
in the east. It is clear that Hitler did not expectFrance simply to stand by and allow Germany toaggrandise its power in the east. ‘I will grind
France to powder’, he told the visiting prime 
minister of Hungary in June 1933. But until a
superior German military strength could be built
up, Hitler explained to his henchmen, he wouldhave to talk the language of peace.Deeds were more convincing than words. InOctober 1933, in a deliberately aimed blow at the
League of Nations, Germany withdrew from the
disarmament conference at Geneva and from theLeague of Nations as well. Hitler then soughtapproval by a plebiscite and claimed in November
that 95 per cent of the German people had
expressed their approval in the ballot box. While
he exaggerated the manipulated vote, he did
secure overwhelming approval, the people wereelated by Hitler’s handling of this aspect of theVersailles Diktat –Germany would no longer be
pushed around. What followed? An outburst of
anger by the other powers? Talk of sanctions? The
British government decided Germany should beconciliated and coaxed back to Geneva, and putpressure on the French to make concessions.Hitler’s priorities in 1933 and 1934 were clear: ﬁrst rearmament and conscription, then aNazi takeover in Austria and the return of theSaar, and at home the consolidation of power.Although Hitler’s next diplomatic move startled
Europe it was obvious Realpolitik. He wished toweaken the two-front threat posed by the alliance
between Poland and France. And so in January1934 he concluded a non-aggression pact withPoland, thereby renouncing German claims to
Danzig and to the Polish corridor, the strip of
territory separating East Prussia from the rest 
of Germany. It was no more than a temporary
expedient. It shows how little faith the Polesplaced in the French alliance. In April 1934 theFrench broke off further disarmament discussions
with Germany. French political weakness at home
turned this apparently tough stand into an empty
gesture. French ministers were under no illusionsabout Hitler’s intentions, but a preventive warwas again rejected. All that was left was diplo-
macy; but the mood was profoundly pessimistic,
and although France would seek closer ties with
Britain, little headway was made until 1936.The foreign minister, Louis Barthou, made adetermined effort for some months in 1934 to
revive France’s Eastern and Danubian alliances
and alignments of the 1920s and to couple this
pressure on Germany with the offer to bind
Germany to an ‘Eastern Locarno’, whereby theSoviet Union, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia,the Baltic states and Finland would all guarantee
each others’ territories and promise to assist one
another. This pact was to be linked to the League
of Nations. No one can deny that Barthou was aman of real energy, but the idea of an ‘EasternLocarno’ was pure moonshine. Hitler had rather
cleverly pre-empted Poland’s possible involve-

ment. Poland preferred to maintain its own non-
aggression treaty with Russia and with Germany
and to retain a free hand. Hitler would not agreeeither. Although he did not feel bound by treaties,he preferred, for the sake of public feeling at home
and in order not to antagonise Germany’s neigh-
bours prematurely, to sign no unnecessary treaties
which he would have to break later on.More promising was France’s rapprochementsin 1934 with Russia and with Italy, which wereto bear fruit in 1935. Barthou also sought to draw
closer to Yugoslavia. His diplomacy was tragically1THE CRUMBLING PEACE, 1933–6207
cut short in October 1934 when he met KingAlexander in Marseilles. A Croat terrorist assassi-nated both Alexander and Barthou, an event dra-
matically captured by the newsreel cameras. His
successor, Pierre Laval, who was to play an infa-
mous role in the wartime Vichy government, in
1935 pursued Barthou’s policy skilfully. Barthou
had wooed Mussolini for Italy’s friendship and
even an alliance for France. In 1934 and 1935
this was a realistic aim – though Mussolini was
notoriously ﬁckle and impulsive – but, militarily
speaking, the Italian alliance was of limited value.Although Mussolini had hoped that Germanywould follow the fascist path of Italy, he was not
so sure about Hitler personally. Hitler, for hispart, admired the duce, who, so he thought wastrying to make something of the Italian people.
The duce was seen by Hitler as a ruthless man of
action who, like himself, believed in superior
force. His framed photograph stood on Hitler’s
desk in Munich. Mussolini’s admiration for Hitler
was not uncritical. He patronised him and sent
him advice; there were times when Mussolini sus-
pected Hitler might be mad. Many Italian fascists
naturally resented Germany’s emphasis on Nordic
racialism and the supposed superiority of light-
skinned blonds over swarthy Latins. In Italy there
was no tradition of anti-Semitism. Indeed, few
Jews lived there and some were prominent fas-cists. In June 1934 Mussolini and Hitler met inVenice. Mussolini stage-managed the whole visit
to impress Hitler with his superiority. Hitler
looked decidedly drab in a raincoat: the junior
partner. As they discussed the questions over
which German–Italian conﬂict might arise, the
agitation of the German-speaking inhabitants in
the South Tyrol and the future of the Austrian
Republic, Hitler said he was ready to abandon the
Germans of the South Tyrol in the interests of
Italian friendship, but Mussolini remained suspi-
cious as the irredentist movement was encouraged
by Nazi Party ofﬁcials. More immediately serious
was Hitler’s pressure on Chancellor EngelbertDollfuss to resign and allow an internal takeoverby the Austrian Nazi movement. Dollfuss reacted
robustly. The Austrian Nazis were now conspir-
ing to seize power.Austria, with a population of 6.5 million, was oneof Europe’s smallest nations. Some 3.5 millionformer German Austrians were now subjects of
the Italians and the Czechs. Austria had not
exactly been created by the Allies at Paris; it con-
sisted of what was left of the Habsburg Empireafter the territories of all the successor states hadbeen shorn off. The Austrian state made very little
economic sense with its large capital in Vienna
and impoverished provinces incapable of feeding
the whole population. Economically the Republic
had been kept afloat only by loans arrangedthrough the League of Nations, whose represen-tatives supervised the government’s ﬁnances. The
depression had hit Austria particularly hard and
unemployment soared. Not surprisingly it was in
Vienna in 1931 that the general Europeanbanking collapse began. This impoverished statewas also deeply divided politically and socially.
Austrian labour was united behind the Social
Democratic Party, which supported the parlia-
mentary constitution and rejected the solutionsboth of revolutionary communism and of fascism.On the right, supported by the Catholic Church,
stood the Christian Social Party and groups of
right-wing nationalist extremists. For a short
while from 1918 to 1920 the Social Democrats
had held power. After 1920, although the SocialDemocrats maintained their strength they nolonger commanded an absolute majority. Except
for a year from 1929 to 1930, the Bürgerblock, acoalition of Christian Socials and Nationalist and
pan-German parties, was in power until theextinction of the multi-party system in 1934. The only issue that united this coalition was a
common hatred of labour and socialism.So deep were the political and social divisionsthat the danger of civil war was always close. The
(Catholic) Christian Socials favoured authoritar-ian solutions, and their fascist and Nazi allies setup paramilitary organisations such as the SA, the
SS and the Heimwehr. The Social Democrats also
sought to defend themselves by enrolling armed
workers in a Republican Defence Corps. Mean-while many Austrians regarded their state as awholly artiﬁcial creation; loyalties were provincial
rather than national. There were many Austrians
who looked towards a union with Germany.208THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
Austria’s internal problems were exacerbated byits more powerful neighbours. Germany posed athreat to its independence. But Mussolini would
defend Austrian independence only if Austria
modelled herself on the fascist state. He speciﬁc-
ally insisted that the Social Democrats should beexcluded from participation in politics. Dollfuss,who became chancellor in May 1932, leant
increasingly on the duce’s support against the
Nazis. In the spring and summer he banned the
Communist Party, the Republican Defence Corps
and the Nazis, and a few months later, early in1934, banned the Social Democrat Party as well.The Social Democrats determined to oppose this
attack on their existence. They offered armed
resistance when their strongholds were attacked.
They were then brutally beaten into submissionduring a brief civil war in February 1934. Demo-cratic Europe was particularly shocked by the
bombardment of the municipal blocks of ﬂats 

of the workers in Vienna. In fact, Dollfuss had
destroyed the one political force able to resist the Nazis.The Austrian Nazi conspiracy to take overpower came to fruition in July 1934. The Nazis
seized the government buildings in Vienna and
forced their way into Dollfuss’s ofﬁce and there
murdered him. Although Dollfuss had lost muchof the support of the ordinary people, few ralliedto the Nazis. The coup failed. Kurt Schuschnigg
was appointed chancellor and promised to con-
tinue the policies of Dollfuss. Whether Hitler had
connived at this Nazi conspiracy and, if so, howfar remains uncertain. But, coming as it did justa month after his visit to Venice, Mussolini was
outraged and rushed troops to the Brenner fron-
tier, warning Hitler not to interfere in Austria.
For a few years longer Austria survived.In Britain, the growing turbulence in Europe andin Asia alarmed even a government as committed
to pacific solutions as that led by Ramsay
MacDonald. Even before Hitler had come to
power, the famous ‘ten-year rule’ was scrapped.It had been adopted in 1919 to save on arma-ments expenditure and postulated that such
expenditure should be based on the assumption
that there would be no war for ten years. Butthere was no real move to rearm for several yearsafter 1932. Throughout the 1920s and in the1930s, too, every British government, Labour
and Conservative, believed that to spend money
on arms would worsen Britain’s economic plight,
making it weaker and less able to resist aggres-sion. It was a perverse and paradoxical conclusion.In February 1933, the Cabinet was informed of
the gross military deﬁciency on land, sea and air
caused by a decade of inadequate ﬁnance, but the
chancellor of the exchequer and future prime
minister, Neville Chamberlain, replied, ‘todayfinancial and economic risks are far the mostserious and urgent that the country has to face 
... other risks have to be run until the country

has had time and opportunity to recuperate and
our ﬁnancial situation to improve’. The depres-sion was Hitler’s best ally. When Churchill, inParliament, attacked the government’s neglect of
Britain’s security, especially in the air, Anthony
Eden, under secretary of state at the Foreign
Ofﬁce, replied that the solution was to persuadethe French to disarm so that Germany wouldlimit its rearmament. Otherwise ‘they could not
secure for Europe that period of appeasement
which is needed’. And, speaking in Birmingham,
Chamberlain added:it is our duty by every effort we can make, byevery inﬂuence we can exert, to compose dif-
ferences, and to act as mediators to try and
devise methods by which other countries may
be delivered from this great menace of war.These speeches from the government side in1933 encapsulate the main tenets of British policy
over the next few years.Too little was done for defence. The great fearwas that the new form of aerial warfare wouldlead to devastation and huge civilian casualties.German superiority in the air could thus become
a potent form of blackmail. Increased defence
spending was accordingly concentrated on the air
force. Curiously, though, it was spent not ondefensive fighter planes but on bombers. Thethinking behind this was that the ‘bombers would
always get through’ anyway. The only credible
form of defence was to build up a deterrent1THE CRUMBLING PEACE, 1933–6209
bomber force that could carry the war to theenemy. Deterrence was preferable to war. In theFar East, the construction of the Singapore naval
base was resumed, even though neglect of the
British ﬂeet meant that there would be few war-
ships to send east if trouble simultaneouslyoccurred in Europe. Worst affected by the parsi-mony of defence expenditure was the British
army. In the event of war, only a token force
could be despatched to France. This limited mil-
itary commitment to the defence of the European
continent was adhered to by governments andcritics until 1939. The main burden of contain-ing Germany on land would rest on the French.British foreign policy followed its own logic.Both France and Germany needed to be re-
strained. Britain would mediate between them.Even though Hitler secretly and openly deﬁedtreaties, Britain would go far to conciliate
Germany and assure it that ‘reasonable’ rearma-
ment would be acceptable to the other powers.
When Eden visited Berlin in February 1934 heattempted to persuade Hitler to return to theLeague, and thought him sincere in wishing to
conclude a disarmament convention. Eden’s
policy was to gain Hitler’s signature to a treaty
which would permit German rearmament but
also, by its very provisions, place a limit on it.When the British government in July 1934announced rearmament in the air, the search for
an Anglo-German agreement did not slacken.
Hitler was outwardly cautious during the six
months from the summer of 1934, which openedwith the failure of the Nazis in Austria and endedin January 1935 with the holding of the plebiscite
in the Saar which would decide that region’s
future.The Saar was ‘brought home’ to the Reich byvotes through the ballot box and not by force,under the supervision of the League of Nations.
Dr Goebbels had, however, mounted a propa-
ganda campaign and so helped to ensure a Nazi
‘yes’ vote of 90 per cent. Hitler’s prestige wasfurther enhanced.In the spring of 1935 Hitler was simplywaiting for a good opportunity to announce the
reintroduction of conscription and Germany’sopen repudiation of the military restrictions of theVersailles Treaty. Everyone, of course, alreadyknew that they had been ‘secretly’ broken for
years. Indeed, a British defence White Paper, pub-
lished in March 1935, which justified modest
British rearmament by referring to Germany’s‘illegal’ rearmament, provided the kind of pretextHitler sought. It was followed by the approval of
the French Chamber on 15 March 1935 to
extend military service from one to two years. On
the very next day Hitler sprang a ‘Saturday sur-
prise’, proclaimed conscription in Germany and‘revealed’ the existence of the Luftwaffe. Britain’sreaction was characteristically weak. Sir John
Simon, the foreign secretary, and Anthony Eden,
minister for League affairs, hastened to Berlin to
exchange views with Hitler. The Führer was nowready to receive them. With conscription in thebag, Hitler could afford to be affable. Britain’s
conciliatory gesture vitiated the meeting of the
Locarno powers at Stresa a short while later in
April 1935. Hitler’s unilateral breach of Versaillesand Locarno was condemned and the need touphold treaties spelt out in the ﬁnal communiqué.
Signiﬁcantly Mussolini had lined up with Britain
and France and not with Germany. The League
then joined in the condemnation.If Hitler was impressed by this united front –and there is no reason to believe he was much –any apprehensions he might have felt were soon
dispelled by the British government. Without con-
sulting its French ally, Britain signified that
Germany could also breach the Versailles limita-tions on its naval development by concluding theAnglo-German Naval Agreement in June 1935.
This now permitted Germany to develop its for-
midable ‘Pocket’ battleships and submarines; all
Germany undertook was not to construct a ﬂeet
whose total tonnage would exceed 35 per cent ofthe combined fleets of the British Common-
wealth. Even so this treaty also held out the 
eventual prospect of equality with Britain in sub-
marines. Hitler did not have to push to open
doors, they were ﬂung open for him. AlreadyHitler was considering his next step, the remili-tarisation of the Rhineland in violation of that part
of the Versailles Treaty that France held dear as a
guarantee of its own security.210THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
Had he moved in the summer of 1935 hewould almost certainly have got away with that too– but the cautious streak in his make-up gained the
upper hand. There would be a much better oppor-

tunity in 1936 when Mussolini was looking for
German support instead of opposing it.The Stresa meeting in April 1935 was not only concerned with Germany. Mussolini was,
himself, planning a breach of the League Cov-
enant, at Abyssinia’s expense. The French were
willing to connive at Mussolini’s aggression. 
They were searching for a diplomatic bargain togain Mussolini’s support against Hitler. ForeignMinister Laval had paved the way when he vis-
ited Rome in January 1935. Mussolini and Laval
then agreed that France and Italy would check 
Hitler’s militaristic ambitions. On the question of Abyssinia, Laval appears to have reassured theduce that France would not impede Italy. But at
Stresa Mussolini was left in no doubt about the
strength of British public feeling if Italy should
attack Abyssinia. The ﬁnal Stresa communiqué,which upheld the sanctity of treaties and con-demned Germany’s breach of them, carefully
avoided reference to any but European conﬂicts.
What was left undone was more important. The
powers realised that Hitler’s next step would be
to remilitarise the Rhineland. But the three Stresapowers, Italy, Britain and France, took nodecisions on how this threat might be met in
time. The British government remained anxious
to conciliate.In the autumn of 1935 Europe’s attention wasﬁxed not on Hitler but on Mussolini’s war of
aggression waged against Abyssinia, the practi-
cally defenceless kingdom of Emperor Haile
Selassie. Mussolini felt he had adequately pre-

pared the ground diplomatically with France andBritain and that in view of the German danger,which he exploited, the two democracies would
acquiesce. The British government, he believed,
would defy pro-League outbursts of public
opinion. But Mussolini had miscalculated theBritish government’s resolve in an election year.Throughout 1935 he built up a huge army, even-
tually reaching 650,000 men, with modern
weapons and poison gas, to overcome theAbyssinian tribesmen. On 3 October 1935 helaunched his war on Abyssinia. The Italian armyafter some initial success became bogged down.
The democratic world admired the plucky resis-
tance of the underdog. At Geneva the League
condemned Italy as an aggressor and voted forsanctions. But sanctions were not rigidly imposednor did they include oil, necessary to fuel Italy’s
war machine. In any case Italy had stockpiled oil
in Africa in expectation of sanctions. Sanctions
proved an irritant, the main result of which was
to create a patriotic reaction in Italy itself.In Britain in June 1935, Ramsay MacDonaldﬁnally retired and Stanley Baldwin became prime
minister. Sir Samuel Hoare, who replaced Sir John
Simon at the Foreign Ofﬁce, conferred with Laval
in December 1935 on partition plans of Abyssiniawhich, it was hoped, would bring the war to anend through secret mediation between Mussolini
and the Abyssinians. The so-called Hoare–Laval
Pact was a ‘compromise’ plan which would have
given Mussolini a large part of Abyssinia. Hemight well have accepted such a solution butwhen the French leaked the agreement, in Britain
there was a great public protest that the League
was being betrayed and the aggressor rewarded.
The British Cabinet, ﬁnding itself in an embar-
rassing position after ﬁghting an election on theissue of support for the League, placed the blameon Hoare and refused to endorse the proposals he
and Laval had agreed upon. Hoare resigned on 19
December 1935. That is how Anthony Eden, who
had himself favoured compromise, now inheritedthe Foreign Ofﬁce.Mussolini resumed his military campaign, andhis troops occupied Addis Ababa in May 1936.
The war was being conducted in the most bar-
barous fashion. The Abyssinians had no means of
defence against air attack or poison gas. The bru-tality of the Italian occupation and the suppres-sion of tribesmen still resisting in 1937 was a
precursor of Nazi terror in occupied Europe
during the Second World War. Thousands of
defenceless Abyssinians were massacred, whileHaile Selassie made his dignified protests inGeneva. The war had brought Mussolini cheap
glory, but it also isolated him and drove him to
seek closer relations with Germany.1THE CRUMBLING PEACE, 1933–6211
The disunity of the ‘Stresa front’ made Hitler’snext move, the remilitarisation of the Rhineland,even less risky than it appeared to be. Hitler later
was to call his boldness in March 1936 the
turning point when he had ‘bluffed’ the French.
It was not a real turning point, but just anotherstep along the road he had already successfullyfollowed. Hitler was looking for a new pretext.
The Franco-Soviet pact, concluded in 1934, pro-
vided it. When the French Chamber ratiﬁed the
treaty, Hitler on 7 March 1936 declared it to be
contrary to the Locarno Treaties and ordered theWehrmacht to move into the demilitarised zoneof the Rhineland. In its ﬁnal timing Hitler’s move
came as a surprise, but the occupation of the
Rhineland had been anticipated and discussed.
French ministers were clear they could not reactwith anything but immediate protests and, lateron, possible recourse to the machinery of League
sanctions. The chief of the army general staff,
General Maurice Gamelin, insisted that no mili-
tary moves were possible without prior full-scale mobilisation, placing more than 1 millionFrenchmen under arms. He pointed out to the
French ministers that there was no immediate
striking force available. The British, meanwhile,
were not prepared to consider mere German
troop movements into the Rhineland zone as suf-ﬁcient reason for a military counterstroke.Thus France, rent by internal conﬂict, couldnot, and Britain would not, consider stopping
Hitler. Hitler, for his part, was careful to enter
the Rhineland with only a small force of lightlyarmed Wehrmacht troops. Rather like rearma-
ment, the open remilitarisation of the Rhineland
had been preceded by ‘secret’ remilitarisation as
the so-called ‘police’ already stationed in the
demilitarised zone were, in fact, trained infantry.
The total force of ‘police’ and Wehrmachtamounted to less than 40,000 men and could notpossibly threaten France.But Hitler was not blufﬁng. He had no inten-tion of accepting defeat had the French marched.
It is a myth that all that was required to humili-
ate Hitler in March 1936 was a French show ofstrength. In the hastily drawn-up ﬁnal war plans,
the German troops were to withdraw as far as the
Ruhr and there to stay and ﬁght. But in view ofearlier French political and military decisions itwas obvious that the only French countermoveswould be diplomatic.These countermoves were handled with skillby the French foreign minister, Pierre Flandin.
He proposed to the British that economic andmilitary sanctions be applied to force Hitler towithdraw. But Eden was looking for mediation.
The British Cabinet had ruled out force. Flandin’s
sanction plan raised the spectre of war with
Germany. Tortuous negotiations in London and
Geneva did not this time end entirely withoutresult. The expected League condemnation wasthe usual empty gesture. But Flandin extracted
from the British government an avowal that
Britain still stood by its Locarno commitment to
France and Belgium. The British Cabinet hadbeen pushed by the French further than it wishedto go in the direction of a strictly defensive Anglo-French alliance backed up by staff talks in place
of the more ﬂexible Locarno agreements. There
was now a much closer Anglo-French alignmentand Britain began to rearm, though still at far tooslow a pace. On the debit side, Belgium reverted
to absolute neutrality.The year 1936 was to be the year of inter-national goodwill. Berlin was host to the Olympic
Games that year. Deﬁance of treaties and the
Nürnberg Laws proved no obstacle to theholding of the games in Berlin. Hitler wanted the
world to come to Berlin and admire the National
Socialist state. No effort was spared to make the
games a spectacular success. For the duration ofthe games anti-Jewish propaganda was toneddown in Berlin. Hitler, moreover, assured the
Olympic Committee that there would be no dis-
crimination between ‘Aryans’ and ‘non-Aryans’, a
promise he did not keep as far as German Jewish
athletes were concerned. It was of course dis-comfiting that the outstanding athlete of thegames was the African American Jesse Owens.
Nazi commentators explained this success,
embarrassing to racial doctrines of superiority, by
stressing that black people were racially lower inthe scale of development, closer to a state ofnature, like animals and hence faster. For Hitler
the holding of the games in Berlin served as an
international recognition of his regime.212THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
To many contemporaries outside Spain theSpanish Civil War represented a great struggle
between the totalitarian forces of the fascist right
against the resistance of the Republic, whoselegitimate government was composed of thePopular Front parties defending democracy. As it
dragged on the war, indeed, came to resemble
such an ideological contest. This was because,
unlike earlier internal Spanish conﬂicts, the Civil
War occurred at a time of deep European divi-sion, when fascism, democracy and communismwere seen to be moving towards a showdown,
which would decide the fate of Europe. Fascism
had spread from Italy to Germany and Eastern
Europe. Fascism, so its fervent opponents be-lieved, should be ﬁnally stopped in Spain. Thebattle in Spain was seen as marking the turning
point of victory or defeat for the fascists. This was
a popular illusion. Governments, communist,
democratic or fascist, understood better that
events in Spain were a secondary problem. Thereal question mark hanging over the future of therest of Europe was how Hitler’s Germany and
Mussolini’s Italy would act in Europe and in
Africa. Would they be satisﬁed with a negotiated
revision of the Versailles settlement, or wasEurope facing a new struggle for supremacy as in1914–18?For the major governments of Europe, Spainwas a sideshow and policy towards Spain was sub-
ordinated to other more important policy objec-tives. In France and Britain in particular (even inthe Soviet Union), there consequently developeda schism between passionate popular feeling,
especially among intellectual adherents of the
broad left, and governments which appeared inca-pable of acting against the fascist menace. InSpain, the simple line of ideological division, as
seen from abroad, was exploited by both sides
since foreign volunteers, and even more so
foreign supplies, played a critical part in military
success. The warring factions in Spain becameknown simply as the insurgent Nationalists (theright) and the Loyalists defending the Republic
(the left). The battle lines between the parties
were not so simple, and the defenders of the
Republic, particularly, were deeply divided. Onthe right the analogy with fascism was not asimple one either.The rise of contemporary fascism and com-munism in the 1920s influenced the political
struggle in Spain itself. Mussolini’s movement
had served as a model to some Spaniards,although the dictator of the 1920s, Primo deRivera, owed only a slight ideological debt to
Mussolini. Socialism and Marxism and anarchism,
rather than Communism of the Stalinist variety,
won adherents in Spain also. But Spanish tradi-tions were strong too. Although political contestassumed some of the forms of the great European
ideological schisms of the twentieth century, its
roots lay also in the conditions of Spain and in
the evolution of past social and political tensions.In searching for the origins of the civil war the1Chapter 20THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR AND EUROPE,
1936–9purely Spanish causes always lie just under thesurface and explain why in 1936 Spain was splitinto two warring sides which inﬂicted savage cru-
elties on each other.In the north the Republicans held most ofAsturias and the Basque region; Catalonia, with
the large city of Barcelona, became a Republican
stronghold; Valencia and the whole Mediterranean
coast and central Spain, the eastern regions of
Andalucia and New Castile with the capital ofMadrid were also Republican regions. The otherbigger cities, except for Seville and Saragossa, were
Republican too. Western Spain, western Aragon,
Old Castile, León and the south – mainly the agri-

cultural regions of Spain – fell into the hands of the
Nationalists. Within each of the regions of Spain
controlled by Nationalists and Republicans, there
were minorities who adhered to the opposite side
and so were subject to murderous reprisals. The
Church, an object of Republican hatred, suffered
grievously in the Republican areas. Landless peas-

ants recruited in the south by the socialists and
anarchists were exposed to Nationalist terror.If we look back no further than to the nine-teenth century, the contest over how Spain wasto be governed was already splitting the countryand leading to civil wars. The more extreme
monarchists, supported by the Church, fought
the constitutionalists and liberal monarchists who
then enjoyed the support of much of the army.
Superimposed on this constitutional conﬂict was
the desire of the northern regions for autonomy:
they opposed attempts to centralise and unify
these regions which enjoyed extensive local rights
and traditions. Spain’s internal turbulence did not
come to an end during the last quarter of the
nineteenth century with the establishment of the
constitutional monarchy and the granting of uni-
versal male suffrage. The votes of the peasants inthe countryside were managed by the wealthy andby local men of inﬂuence. Despite the liberal con-
stitution, the parliamentary system did not
embody the hopes of all the reformers. Popular
discontent was further increased by Spain’s poor
showing abroad. The loss of colonies, the war
with the US at the turn of the century and the
failures of its imperial policies in Morocco, wherethe Spanish army suffered defeats, weakened theauthority of government.Besides the constitutional conﬂict, the problemof the regions and the failures of foreign and
imperial policies, Spanish industrialisation, though
slow, was concentrated in the north and so 
added to regional particularism as well as leading
to bitter economic conﬂict between worker and
employer. Spain was a very poor country, and suf-
fered perennially from the agricultural problem of
its landless and impoverished peasantry. In the
early twentieth century socialism made headway in
Spain. As in France, the movement was divided
and the anarcho-syndicalists who believed in
direct action had won many adherents among theworkers of the north and some of the peasants in the south. The strength of their main trade
union organisation, the CNT, lay in Catalonia 
and especially in Barcelona. Before 1936, the
Communist Party was small.On more than one occasion in the early twen-tieth century Spain seemed to be poised on the
brink of civil war; Barcelona, the capital of
Catalonia, was a focal point of bloodshed and civil
conﬂict. The civil guard, hated by the workers,
kept unrest just in check by ruthless force. Spain
was disintegrating amid warring factions, while
the politicians of the Cortes, the Spanish parlia-
ment, proved unable to provide effective andstable governments. In September 1923, repeat-ing a pattern familiar in the nineteenth century,
an army general seized power to bring peace to
Spain and save it from monarchist politicians.
Compared with other dictators, this general,
Primo de Rivera, was a charismatic ﬁgure. The
king, Alfonso XIII, acquiesced in the overthrow
of the constitution. Primo de Rivera followed a
policy of repression of politicians, the Socialist
Party, anarchists and supporters of Catalan
regionalism. The socialist trade union, the UGT,
became a mainstay of the regime. He also inau-
gurated public works which, in the 1920s, seemed
to promise some economic progress. Yet by 1930he had exhausted his credit and lost support inthe army, and the king dismissed him. The king
himself did not long survive. The cities had
turned against him and he left for exile in 1931.214THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
The second Republic was then establishedwithout violence or bloodshed. Its history wasbrief and ﬁlled with mounting political and social
conﬂict. The left had drawn together, temporar-
ily as it turned out, to take charge of the country.
But it was characteristic of the politics of the leftand the right that, once the electoral victory waswon by electoral pacts, rivalry between the parties
would thereafter prevent any coalition from pro-
viding stable government.First, until the end of 1933, the Republic wasgoverned by a coalition of the left and moderateRepublicans under the leadership of ManuelAzaña. He sought to solve the regional question
by granting autonomy to the Catalans; he pro-
moted educational reform, and plunged into a
programme of agricultural reform which achievedlittle. In the summer of 1932, there was anabortive generals’ rising against the government
of the Republic. It was a ﬁasco.What caused the greatest bitterness was theanti-clerical legislation of the government, whichregarded the Church as the bulwark of reaction. Itdrove moderate supporters who were faithful
Catholics into opposition. The anarchists stirred
up the workers in violent strikes which the gov-
ernment suppressed with bloodshed, thus alien-
ating supporters on the left. The moderate politicians, of whom Azaña was an example, wereassailed by extremists on the left and right, and
even the more moderate Socialists looked fearfully
over their shoulders lest supporting the govern-
ment should lose them the allegiance of their fol-lowers to those political groups further to the left,especially the anarchists. During the election of
November 1933, the left no longer fought by
means of electoral agreements. It was the turn of
the right to strike such bargains, forming a com-
mon opposition to the government’s anti-clericallegislation. Gil Robles founded CEDA, a confed-eration of right-wing Catholic groups. A new elec-
toral pact, with the radicals changing sides and
now supporting CEDA, gave the centre-right a
resounding victory. From 1934 to 1936 theRepublic struggled on amid mounting tensions.The coalition government of the centre sup-ported by CEDA reversed the ‘progressive’
aspects of the legislation of Azaña’s government.With the roles reversed, the miners in Asturias,under the united leadership of socialists, commu-nists and anarchists began a general strike in
October 1934 and seized Oviedo, the provincial
capital. Simultaneously there occurred an abortive
separatist rising in Catalonia. The governmentretaliated by using the Foreign Legion andMoorish troops from Morocco bloodily to sup-
press the Asturian rising. The shootings and tor-
tures inflicted on the miners increased the
extreme bitterness of the workers, while there was
strong Catholic feeling against the godlessMarxist conspiracy. Both the left and right werestrengthening their following. Among groups of
the right, José Antonio, son of Primo de Rivera,
attracted increasing support to the Falange Party,
which he had founded in 1933 and which cameclosest to a fascist party in Spain. But in the elec-tion of February 1936 the parties of the left,
which were out of power, organised an effective
electoral pact and presented themselves as the
Popular Front. Its cry was that the Republic wasin danger and that the parties of the right werefascist. The parties of the right called on the elec-
torate to vote for Spain and against revolution.
Spanish politics had become so polarised that
neither the parties of the right nor those of the
left were ready to accept the ‘democratic’ verdictof the people. The Popular Front combinationgave the left the parliamentary victory, but the
country was almost equally split between left and
right in the votes cast. What was now lacking was
a strong grouping of the centre, a majority whobelieved in a genuine democratic peace and par-liamentary institutions.The familiar spectacle of the united left achievingelectoral victory, and then falling into division
when they got to power, was repeated in thespring and summer of 1936. The left-wing social-ists, led by Largo Caballero, rejected all coopera-
tion with left ‘bourgeois’ governments; Caballero
continued the Popular Front but would not serve
in the government. He was supported by thecommunists; but despite all his revolutionary lan-guage, he had no plans for revolution. On the
right, however, plans were drawn up to forestall
the supposed revolution of the left. The generals1THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR AND EUROPE, 1936–9215
justiﬁed their July 1936 rising on precisely thesegrounds. Attacked by those who should have sup-ported the Republic, the government was too
weak to suppress the generals’ rising as easily as
in 1932. But the right, on its own, was unable to
wrest power from the government, either elec-torally or by force. It called on the army to restoreconservative order and to uphold the values and
position of the Church. And the army assumed
this task in an action that had more in common
with nineteenth-century Spanish tradition and the
military seizure of power by Primo de Rivera in1923, than with Nazi or fascist takeovers whichwere backed by their own paramilitary supporters,
the army standing aside.The government of the left in 1931–2 hadoffended army feeling by attempting its reform,replacing many ofﬁcers with those whose loyaltyto the Republic seemed certain. A large number 
of such promotions after the victory of thePopular Front in 1936 offended the traditionalistofﬁcers, and General Francisco Franco, ‘banished’to the military governorship of the remote Canary
Islands, protested that such unfair practices
offended the dignity of the army. The leader of
the ofﬁcers’ conspiracy was not Franco, however,but General José Sanjurjo, and General EmilioMola was its chief organiser. The army itself 
was divided between those ready to overthrow 
the Republic and those still prepared to serve 
it. Franco himself hesitated almost to the last
moment. The increasing disorder in Spain – thelawlessness and violence of demonstrations of the left, which the government seemed unable to
control – ﬁnally decided the army conspirators in
July 1936 to carry out a military coup, ‘planned’
since the previous April, to take over Spain.Franco had ﬁnally thrown in his lot with theconspirators and secretly, on 18 July, left the
Canary Islands to take charge of the army in216THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39

the military rising, which had actually already
been set in motion. A day early, on 17 July, the
army rose in Morocco. General Mola had orderedthe risings to begin in Morocco on 18 July andthe garrisons in mainland Spain to take power a
day later. But the risings on the mainland also
began earlier, on the 18th, and the following day
spread to Spain’s two largest cities, Madrid and
Barcelona. Here the risings were successfully sup-pressed. Thus the army failed to take over thewhole of Spain in one swift action. Within a 
short time the Nationalist and Republican zones
were becoming clear. Their respective military
resources were fairly equally balanced in metro-politan Spain with about half the army and mostof the air force and much of the ﬂeet siding with
the government of the Republic.What decisively tipped the balance was thehelp Hitler and Mussolini gave to Franco, pro-viding transport planes to ferry the African army
to the peninsula. Franco decided not to risk cross-
ing by sea. The Republican ﬂeet’s doubtful capac-
ity was thus not tested. The disorganisation onthe Republican side extended to the air force,which made no efforts to intercept the German
and Italian transport planes. The Nationalists
speedily dominated the west and much of the
south. By the end of July, Burgos in the north
had become the capital of Nationalist Spain.There, Mola had set up a junta of generals.However, it was Franco who was accepted by all
the generals as their commander-in-chief; by the
end of September he was also declared head of
the Spanish state as well as of the government.This marked the beginning of a long, undisputedhold on absolute power which was to last until
his death thirty-nine years later in 1975.1THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR AND EUROPE, 1936–9217
Militia coming to the aid of the Republic, 1936. © Robert Capa R/Magnum PhotosAs the Nationalists captured Republican-heldterritory, prominent Republican leaders, civil andmilitary, were murdered in their tens of thou-
sands. Terror was a weapon used to cow working-class populations. On the Republican side attackswere indiscriminately directed against the Church.
The Church’s political identiﬁcation with the right
(except in the Basque provinces) was beyonddoubt, but the Church had not participated in the uprising. Twelve bishops and thousands of
priests and monks were murdered. Many thou-sands suspected of sympathy with the Nationalistswere summarily executed. The government of the
Republic could not control its followers in this
bloody lawlessness. The bitter hatreds of the frat-ricidal war have lived on as long as survivors ofboth sides remain to recall the atrocities of three
years of war. These murders on both sides havebeen estimated to total a ghastly 130,000 (75,000committed by the Nationalists and 55,000 by 
the Republicans). To these losses must be added
deaths in battle – 90,000 Nationalists and110,000 Republicans – and death from all othercauses, about 500,000, out of a total population
of 25 million.The Republicans had the difficult task ofwelding together an effective central government
in Madrid from all the disparate forces of the left,
and a cohesive army from the many military for-mations that had gathered spontaneously. TheCommunists, declaring that the ‘revolution’ had
to be postponed, joined the moderate Socialistsand Republicans. Largo Caballero headed aPopular Front government in the autumn of
1936 which even the anarchists, dominant in
Catalonia and Barcelona, joined. But the leftcould not maintain unity through the war. Their‘fraternal’ strife, with the communists ﬁghting the
anarchists and the anti-Stalinist Marxists (knownby their initials as POUM), was the main causeof the ultimate defeat of the Republic. On the
other side, despite the heterogeneous political
complexion of the Nationalists, Franco and thearmy dominated and created an effective unityand an impressive ﬁghting force.After the Nationalist advances in August toOctober 1936, the Republic still held half of Spain– the whole east and south-east, as well as a strip in
the north. Madrid remained in government hands,having repulsed the Nationalist advance. In 1937the Nationalists ﬁnally overcame Basque resistancein the north. In Madrid the government was reor-

ganised to take a stronger line against dissidents.The Communists, whose strength rapidly grew,took a lead in ﬁghting against the POUM and the

anarchists. Caballero was replaced as premier by a
socialist professor, Dr Juan Negrin. By now theRepublicans had organised a well-disciplined army.In the winter of 1937 the Republican army
launched an offensive against the Nationalists.Franco’s counter-offensive, however, recovered allthe lost territory and went on to split the Republic
in half, separating Barcelona and Catalonia from
central and southern Spain. The defeat of theRepublic appeared imminent. Unexpectedly theRepublicans won a short-lived victory in the sum-

mer of 1938, but then in the autumn suffered acatastrophic defeat when Franco counter-attacked.Internationally the Republic simultaneously sus-

tained devastating blows. France, which intermit-

tently had allowed arms to pass the Pyreneesfrontier, closed it, and Stalin gave up sending aid tothe Republic. Franco’s victories and the desertion
of the Soviet Union and France doomed theRepublic. In January 1939 Barcelona fell. StillNegrin inspired the ﬁnal resistance. The Republic

came to an end in confusion, with part of its own
armed forces in rebellion. At the end of March1939, Madrid ﬁnally capitulated to Franco’s army.The Spanish Civil War was over. It haddragged on with enormous loss of life. Refugeesnow ﬂooded across the Pyrenees into France. ButEurope’s attention was only momentarily ﬁxed on
the final agony. War between the European
powers had been only narrowly averted in theautumn of 1938, and now in March 1939 Hitleragain held the centre of the stage. The world
would soon turn upside down. The Communists,seen by the left-wing idealists as the real oppo-nents of the Fascists and Nazis in Spain, would
that same year, in September 1939, praise Hitler
and condemn the imperialist-capitalist Westerndemocracies for going to war to check Naziexpansion in Europe.German and Italian help had been critical inthe early stages of the war and favoured Franco’sadvance to the gates of Madrid. But massiveSoviet military assistance including planes and218THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
tanks saved Madrid in November 1936. Britainand France, ostensibly with German, Soviet and
Italian agreement, set up a Non-Intervention
Committee whose undertaking not to sendweapons to either side was honoured only by thetwo Western democracies. The Germans sent
tanks and experts and the notorious Condor
Legion, which, with a hundred planes, played an
important role and horriﬁed the democracies bybombing defenceless towns. The wanton destruc-tion of Guernica (26 April 1937) symbolised the
terror of war on civilians. The lesson was not loston the British who week after week saw on theircinema screens the horrible effects of those air
raids. Not surprisingly it strengthened the desire
of the British people to keep out of war and tosupport those politicians who were trying to doso, though the committed did go to fight in
Spain. Mussolini sent over 70,000 volunteer
troops. The Russians, from headquarters in Paris,
organised the volunteer International Brigadesand sent tanks and planes. All this foreign aid suc-ceeded in staving off defeat for either side for a
time, but it was not sufﬁcient to ensure a victory.1THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR AND EUROPE, 1936–9219

EbroThe Spanish Civil War, 1936Responsibility is a portmanteau word coveringmany different meanings. All the nations in a
complex international society are to some degreeinvolved with each other and in that sense share‘responsibility’ for the most important inter-
national events such as war. In that sense, too, it
is both true and misleading to conclude that
Hitler’s Germany was not alone responsible forthe outbreak of war in 1939 – misleading whenresponsibility is equated with blame, and blame,
like responsibility, is considered something to be
shared out between all the nations involved. Such
an analysis of responsibility for the outbreak of
the second great war in Europe, confuses morethan it illuminates.Hitler, in September 1939, posed before theGerman people as the injured party, as acting in
defence of Germans persecuted by Poles, and inresponse to actual Polish attacks across the fron-tier (in fact, secretly organised by the Gestapo).Since coming to power he had built up the armed
forces of the Reich, not simply to gain his ends
by the bluff of overawing Germany’s weaker
neighbours: the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe were
fighting instruments prepared for real use.Although not precisely certain of the right timing,Hitler intended all along to pass from a policy of
piecemeal territorial acquisition by blackmail to
actual wars of conquest. In September 1938, he
was frustrated when he could not make war onCzechoslovakia. A year later he was not againdeterred. On 23 November 1939, a few weeksafter war began, he summoned the chiefs of thearmed services and explained that he had not
been sure whether to attack ﬁrst in the East or inthe West (it should be noted that it was only aquestion of either/or); but Polish resistance to his
demands had decided the issue:One will blame me [for engaging in] war andmore war. I regard such struggle as the fate ofall being. No one can avoid the ﬁght if he does
not wish to be the inferior. The growth of
population requires a larger living space. My
aim was to bring about a sensible relationship
between population size and living space. Thisis where the military struggle has to begin. Nopeople can evade the solution of this task
unless it renounces and gradually succumbs.
That is the lesson of history ...
While Hitler remained in power he intendedpassing from the phase of preparation for war to
actual wars of conquest, and the purpose of these
conquests was the aggrandisement of Germany
itself, and the reduction of the conquered nations
who would retain a separate existence only assatellites. The dominated people would all haveto conform to Hitler’s racialist plan for the New
Order of Europe. This racialist basis of Nazi
policy meant not that Hitler aimed at a
Wilhelmine German domination of Europe, butthat he planned a European revolution entailingmass population movements in the East, murderChapter 21THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE,
1937–9and the enslavement of ‘inferior’ races. For Hitler,then, the question of war and peace was a ques-tion of timing, of choosing the moment that
promised the greatest chance of success.The French, whose assessment of Hitler’s aimstended to be more realistic than that of the British,would not in any case risk war with Germany without a cast-iron guarantee of Britain’s backing.
Even then doubts about France’s survival as a
great power if it were further weakened by heavy
losses of men and reserves made the French 
look at the prospect with horror. What was true of France was also true of Germany’s smallerneighbours. As for the Soviet Union, it shared 
no frontier with Germany and hoped to contain it
by deterrence in association with the Western
powers; but that policy was bluff since the Sovietalternative to the failure of deterrence was not warbut a truce, an accommodation with Germany.
The US championed democracy abroad, though
imperfectly at home and, equally fervently, neu-
trality if it should come to war in Europe. Thatgave Britain the key role.Until the spring of 1939, Neville Chamberlaindominated the Cabinet as few prime ministers had
before him. He was Hitler’s most formidable pro-
tagonist. Chamberlain too, though subject to
public opinion and the pressure of his colleagues,would have to decide when to accept that generalEuropean war was inevitable, unless Britain were
simply to stand by while Hitler secured the dom-
ination of the European continent. The conquest
of Poland would have been followed by otherconquests, though no one can be sure in whatdirection Hitler would have struck ﬁrst and so
what precise sequence he would have followed.
Nor did he intend to spare a hostile and inde-
pendent Britain. When Hitler passed from ‘cold’
war to ‘hot’ war, Chamberlain reluctantly accept-ed that a great European war would becomeinevitable if Britain’s independence and security
were to survive.Chamberlain’s attitude stands in stark contrastto Hitler’s. Chamberlain abhorred war. Hebelonged to the generation of the Great War.Humanitarian feelings were the positive motiva-
tions of his life. He wished to better the lot of his
fellow men, to cure the ills, in particular unem-ployment, that still beset Britain’s industrial life.War, to him, was the ultimate waste and negationof human values. He believed in the sanctity of
individual human life and rejected the crude
notions of a people’s destiny, puriﬁcation through
violence and struggle, and the attainment of endsby brute force. He had faith in the triumph ofreason and, believing himself to be ﬁghting the
good fight for peace, he was prepared to be
patient, tenacious and stubborn, drawing on
inner resources to maintain a personal optimism
even when conditions all around pointed theother way. To the very end he hoped for somemiracle that would ensure a peaceful outcome.
Only a week away from war at the end of August
1939 he expressed his feelings in a private letter
to his sister Hilda:I feel like a man driving a clumsy coach overa narrow cracked road along the face of a
precipice ... I sat with Annie [Mrs

Chamberlain] in the drawing room, unable toread, unable to talk, just sitting with foldedhands and a gnawing pain in the stomach.When Chamberlain spoke to the nation over theBBC at the outbreak of war, he, unlike Hitler,
could say with sincerity:You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to methat all my long struggle to win peace has
failed. Yet I cannot believe that there is any-
thing more or anything different that I couldhave done and that would have been more suc-cessful. His [Hitler’s] action shows convinc-
ingly that there is no choice of expecting that
this man will ever give up his practice of using
force to gain his will. He can only be stopped
by force.There is no meaningful way Chamberlain’sresponsibility for war can be compared on the
same basis as Hitler’s, any more than a man who
violently attacks his neighbour is less responsiblefor his action because of the weakness of thepolice force.This is not to suggest that the origins of thewar in Europe can be reduced to a contrast1THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE, 1937–9221
between two men, Hitler and Chamberlain. Hitlercould not safely wage war without the assurancethat rearmament had progressed sufﬁciently – an
assurance that required the cooperation of indus-
try and the management of ﬁnance. Actually the
reserves were very low. Nor could he totally
ignore technical military considerations. He
needed the cooperation of the army. The overlap-
ping party and state machinery of government,
and the gearing of the economy to war prepara-
tions under Hermann Göring’s overall direction,
created many problems. The ‘court’ of leading
Nazis around the Führer – Himmler, Goebbels,
Hess, Bormann, Göring, and lesser sub-leaders
such as Rosenberg, Ribbentrop and Ley – wereengaged in bitter inﬁghting, jockeying for Hitler’sfavour and a more inﬂuential place in the hierar-
chy. German policy making was not monolithic;
various highly placed people and organisations
inﬂuenced policy. Hitler certainly had the last
word on all major issues, but took care to try to
carry the leaders of the army, industry and the
mass of the people with him. His speeches were a
torrent of untruths, carefully calculated; he was
well aware that war with Britain and France was
widely regarded with apprehension.The many dimensions of British policy andinﬂuences shaping it are just as complex, though
different. Party political considerations play animportant role in the making of policy in a parlia-
mentary democracy. Governments were more
directly affected by public feeling, which could be
freely expressed, unlike in Germany. Decisions in
Britain were taken by committees, the supreme
government committee being the Cabinet, which
met at the prime minister’s residence. Chamber-

lain’s control was never dictatorial as Hitler’s was.
Chamberlain’s ascendancy over his ministerial col-

leagues was at its height in 1938, but he could not
act without carrying them with him – resignations
had to be contained to the single minister in dis-

agreement. In 1939, Chamberlain’s inﬂuence less-

ened as the assumption behind his policies wasseen to be more and more at variance with unfold-
ing events in Europe. Belated rearmament was a
particular handicap, narrowing Britain’s policy
options.There was one further, striking differencebetween German and British policy. Hitler paidrelatively little attention to his two ‘allies’, Italy
and Japan, and fashioned policy without allowing
their reactions to affect his own decisions. Not so
the British government, which, while taking thelead in the framing of the policy in the West,could not ignore France’s reactions and later
Poland’s. Britain stood at the centre of the
Commonwealth, and the views of Canada, South
Africa, Australia and New Zealand also made
themselves felt.The greatest difference between Britain’s andGermany’s positions derived from Britain’s role
not only as a European but a world power with
imperial interests in every continent. These inter-
ests were each supported by different politiciansand pressure groups which conﬂicted with eachother when the priorities of policies came to 
be resolved. Britain’s commitments to defend
Australia, New Zealand and India from the
Japanese threat were as absolute as considerationsof security at home which required Britain tostand by France if it were attacked by Germany.
The Defence Requirements Committee, speciﬁc-
ally assigned the task of analysing Britain’s mili-
tary needs, came to a clear decision when it
reported to the Cabinet in February 1934 thatGermany was ‘the ultimate potential enemyagainst whom all our “long range” defence policy
must be directed’.For many years none of Britain’s armed forceswould be strong enough to meet all potentialenemies. At ﬁrst there were only two of these:Germany in Europe, rapidly arming, and Japan in
Asia. With the outbreak of the Italian–Abyssinian
war and Britain’s support for League sanctions
there was now a third potential enemy with naval
forces in the Mediterranean – Italy. The need todefend every British possession was equallyabsolute. How then was the lack of resources to
be matched to these requirements? That was the
task of diplomacy. The real question was not
whether or not to appease, but which nation tostand up to and which to conciliate. In the FarEast much would depend on the attitude of the
US. Britain’s situation vis-à-vis the US in Asia was
similar to that of France vis-à-vis Britain in222THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
Europe. France could not risk war with Germanywithout British support; Britain could not affordto contemplate war with Japan without the guar-
antee of American support unless driven into war
in defence of the territory of the empire and
Commonwealth. In Europe also, Britain couldonly act defensively. Its air force, intended as adeterrent, lagged behind the strength of the
German air force and so its deterrent value never
materialised. It did not even ﬁgure in Hitler’s cal-
culations: Germany made great efforts towards
self-sufficiency (autarky) under Göring’s Four-Year Plan after 1936, though Hitler recognisedthat, without conquests, self-sufﬁciency could not
be completely attained. Nevertheless, dependence
on foreign supplies was reduced and to that
extent the damage that a British blockade by seacould inﬂict lessened. How then did Britain con-ceive a war with Germany might be conducted so
that it would end in Germany’s defeat?The one consistent military assumption thatthe politicians in the British Cabinet made untilFebruary 1939 was the extraordinary one thatBritain needed no large army to ﬁght Germany
on the continent. Chamberlain, as chancellor of
the exchequer, argued that there was not enough
money to expand all three services and everyone,
except the chiefs of staff, agreed that the Britishpublic would never accept that Britain should, asin 1914–18, send an army of millions to France
and Belgium. The French realised that they could
not opt out of providing the land army to repel
Germany. All the heavy casualties would thus fallon them. No wonder that in the circumstancesthey sought to protect their depleted manhood
by reliance on the Maginot Line and felt bitter-
ness towards their British ally.While the British and French service chiefswere agreed that the most dangerous enemywould be a rearmed Germany, their policytowards Italy was never coordinated. When
France wanted to conciliate Mussolini in 1935,
Britain gave no backing and in January 1939 the
reverse occurred. British attention, moreover, andFrench too, was not exclusively fixed onGermany. From 1931 to 1933 Japanese aggres-
sion in Manchuria and the question of support for
the League of Nations occupied the attention ofthe public and of governments. Alarm atGermany’s growing armament was next divertedby the Italian–Abyssinian war in 1935. Hitler was
singularly lucky at having these ‘diversions’
during his years of military preparations. In just
the same way the remilitarisation of theRhineland, Germany’s own ‘backyard’, soon cameto be overshadowed by the outbreak of the
Spanish Civil War. While Hitler incessantly
worked in his foreign relations to extend and
strengthen Germany, he was simultaneously
transforming the country from inside withincreasing emphasis on Nazi ideology and themilitarisation of the whole of society. German
women were admonished to ‘give’ the Führer
many babies, the soldiers of the future. The
Führer cultivated the image of the lone leader onwhom rested all the burdens of his people. Hewas occasionally shown more humanly in the
company of children and dogs. But the existence
of his blonde mistress, Eva Braun, was one of the
best-kept secrets of the Third Reich.The middle 1930s were years of feverish prepara-tion for the great moment when Nazi Germany
would consummate Hitler’s revolution and estab-
lish the new racial order in Europe. The prepara-
tions were still taking place within the frontiers of Germany, though party propaganda was reach-ing out and spawning local parties not only in
Austria but as far aﬁeld as Latin America. Within
Germany, incessant propaganda was directed
against one arch-opponent in Nazi demonology,the Jews. Despite widespread anti-SemitismHitler felt he had to move with caution so as not
to arouse sympathy for the Jews: many good
‘Aryans’ knew at least ‘one good’ Jew. The Jews
were bewildered. Many saw themselves as patri-
otic Germans, tied to German culture, andthought the Hitler phenomenon was a passingmadness. The tide of emigration was slow. They
could transfer only a fraction of their possessions
out of the country. Opportunities of earning a
living abroad were restricted, and the languageand customs were strange. Most German Jewshung on. Despite all the discrimination against
them they continued to enjoy the protection of
the law from common violence. By and large they1THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE, 1937–9223
were not physically molested before November1938. Nevertheless, the screw was being turnedmore tightly year by year.The notorious anti-Semitic Nürnberg Laws,ﬁrst proclaimed at the Nazi Party rally in 1935,
and in subsequent years constantly extended,were but a logical step in the direction of the newNazi world that Hitler and his followers were cre-
ating. The persecution of the Jews was not an
accidental blemish of Hitler’s rule. Without
hatred of Jews and the relentless persecution
waged against them, the core of Nazi ideologycollapses.In 1935 all Jews remaining in the civil servicewere dismissed. The deﬁnitions of ‘full’ Jew, ‘half’
Jew or Mischlinge– ‘mixtures’ of various degrees– were determined not by a man’s baptism or per-sonal belief but by descent. Three Jewish grand-parents made the second-generation descendants
all Jews. The ‘full’ Jews, or ‘non-Aryans’ as they
were called, felt the total weight of persecution
from the very start. The only temporary exceptionwas made in cases where Jews were married toAryans and there were ‘mixed’ children from the
marriage. Pressure was placed on the Christian
partner to divorce the Jewish spouse. Some did
so. Other German wives and husbands protected
their partner and children with the utmostcourage and loyalty throughout the years of per-secution and so saved their lives; the war ended
before Hitler could take measures against them.
These brave people came from every walk of life.
Their behaviour alone should serve as a cautionagainst crude generalisations about the ‘Germancharacter’, even though they formed, like the
active resistance, only a small minority of the pop-
ulation. The Nürnberg Laws made the German
Jews second-class citizens ofﬁcially and forbade
further marriages between Jews and non-Jews andany sexual relations between Aryans and Jews.This latter crime was called Rassenschande andsevere sentences were passed where Jewish men
were accused. Over a period of time Jews were
removed from all professional contact with non-Jews. Only in business activities were Jews per-mitted to carry on until 1938, since it was feared
that their sudden removal would harm the
German economy. This concession was not dueto Hitler’s moderation – rather it is an indicationthat he was prepared to countenance a tacticaldelay while never deviating one inch from his ulti-
mate ideological goals.This pressure on the helpless, small GermanJewish population in 1933 – there were about500,000 racially deﬁned as Jews – drove theminto increasing isolation and hardship. Even so
they did not emigrate to Palestine or elsewhere
fast enough. The majority of German Jews
wanted to stay in their homes and in their
country, whose cultural heritage they cherished.German culture was their culture. Not inmoments of blackest nightmare could they
imagine that in the twentieth century in Western
Europe women and children would be murdered
in factories of death. Many Jews were still livingin reasonable comfort, and for the most part rela-tionships with their fellow Germans were correct
and occasionally even friendly. But ofﬁcial dis-
crimination steadily increased; Jews were expelled
by the autumn of 1938 from all professions, they could no longer study in universities, andtheir shops were compulsorily purchased and
Aryanised. It was by then clear that there was no
future for young Jews, but the older generation
expected to live out the rest of their days in
Germany on their pensions and savings. Duringthe summer of 1938, however, the Nazi leader-ship had decided to take far harsher measures
against the Jews. First, it was the turn of Jews
from Poland to be expelled brutally overnight.
Then concentration camps were readied insideGermany. The German people would be given apractical demonstration of how to treat their
Jewish neighbours as their enemies. Only a
pretext was needed.It was provided on 7 November 1938 by thefatal shooting of the third secretary of theGerman Embassy in Paris. The perpetrator was ahalf-crazed young Jew whose parents (of Polish
origin) had just been deported. Paradoxically, the
diplomat, Ernst vom Rath, was no Nazi. After
news of Rath’s death reached Germany on theafternoon of 9 November, a pogrom all overGermany was launched. Synagogues were set on
ﬁre, Jewish shop windows smashed. With typical
black humour, Berliners dubbed the 9 November224THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
‘Kristallnacht’, the night of shards of glass. Gangsof rufﬁans roamed the streets and entered Jewishapartments – it was a night of terror. Jewish men
were arrested in their homes on the following 
day and incarcerated in concentration camps.
Goebbels’ diary fully implicates Hitler, thusadding more evidence, if any were needed, thatno major action could be undertaken in the Reich
without the Führer’s explicit approval. It so hap-
pened that 9 November was the annual occasion
when all the Nazi leaders met to commemorate
the abortive Putschof 1923. In Munich,Goebbels wrote in his diary:I report the situation to the Führer. He decides:let the demonstrations continue. Pull back the
police. The Jews should be made to feel thewrath of the people. ... As I head for the hotel,
I see the sky is blood-red. The synagogue is
burning. ... the Führer has ordered 20,000–

30,000 Jews to be arrested immediately.The purpose of the great November pogromof 1938 was to force the remaining Jews into emi-
gration. A visa to a foreign country gained release
from concentration camps. The question is often
asked: why did Hitler try to force the Jews out of
Germany even after the war began? Does thismean he would have preferred this solution tomurdering them later? We do not know exactly
what was in Hitler’s mind but it is safe to con-
clude that humanitarian considerations did not
come into his calculations on so central a ques-tion as his hatred of the Jews. He certainly wassensitive to German public feeling and presum-
ably concluded that the German people were not
ready to back his rule with increasing enthusiasm
if he simply massacred all German Jews, men,
women and children, inside the Reich.During the war, vain efforts were made to pre-serve the secrecy of the death camps. Hitler
wished to remove physically all Jews from the ter-
ritory ruled by him. Emigration would ‘export’
anti-Semitism. And when he had won his wars theJews would be done for in any case, as Nazi poli-cies in all occupied Europe were to show during
the war. After November 1938 the Jews in panic
belatedly attempted to leave: the civilised worlddebated but could not agree to absorb theremaining 300,000. But tens of thousands ofpeople were saved, with the ‘children’s transports’
to Britain forming a poignant part of these emi-
grants. Most of these children never saw their
parents again. The exodus was made possible bythe response of thousands of concerned individ-uals who collected money and pressurised their
reluctant governments to let the refugees in. The
Jewish persecution by bureaucratic machine
involved and implicated more and more Germans
in the criminal activities of the Nazi regime underpseudo-legislative cover. Opposition becamemore risky as the grip of the totalitarian state
tightened. There were still a few who spoke out
openly, such as the Protestant pastor Martin
Niemöller, and were placed in concentrationcamps. Amid the general enthusiasm for theNazis, it must be remembered that there were
many, too, who were terrorised into silence.The Jews were the most obvious and opentargets of persecution. But there were hundredsof thousands of others who suffered. In ruthlesspursuit of the supposedly racially healthy German
Volk, laws were passed in 1933 which permitted
mass sterilisation of those deemed able to pass on
genetic defects, such as medical handicaps,
epilepsy and deafness, mental defects or evensocial defects, one of which was identified asdrunkenness and another as habitual criminality.
Not only were pregnancies aborted and sterilisa-
tion ordered for the individual affected, but the
whole family, including young adolescents, weresterilised. Convicted homosexuals were incarcer-ated in concentration camps. In the interests of
‘racial hygiene’ it was then but a step to proceed
to murder people with disabilities during the war
under the pretence that they were being released
from their suffering – this was the ‘euthanasia’programme. But, as with the murder of the Jews,Hitler decided that the extermination of ‘lives not
worthy of life’ would have to wait for the cover
of war. Racial discrimination after 1935 was also
suffered by the 22,000 gypsies living in Germany.They too, men, women, children and babies,together with the tens of thousands of Polish and
European gypsies, were designated for extermi-
nation.1THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE, 1937–9225
Hitler was still telling the German people that hewanted peace and desired no more than to bringhome to the Reich those German people living
beyond the German frontier: not just the people
of course but also the lands in which they were
living. At a meeting of his military commandersand in the presence also of the foreign and warministers in his chancellery on 5 November 1937
Hitler spoke his mind. Colonel Hossbach
recorded the meeting. The aims Hitler expressed
contained nothing new; they were all familiarfrom his previous statements and writings. Hereferred to the need to realise them within six to
eight years at the latest. The German race needed
space in the east to expand and multiply or it
would be doomed to decline. More land and
resources were an economic necessity. The solu-tion to Germany’s problems could be found onlyby using force. Beyond the years 1943–5 the rear-
mament of Germany’s enemies would exceed the
ageing equipment of the German military.
Germany had to assume the enmity of Britain andFrance. Hitler speculated on international com-plications like a civil war in France or a warbetween the Mediterranean powers which woulddivide Germany’s enemies to its advantage. As aﬁrst step, a strategic necessity was an ‘attack’ on
Austria and Czechoslovakia. It was therefore
obvious that rearmament expenditure could not
be reduced. The immediate objective of winningAustria and Czechoslovakia, however, would beattained by a little war conducted with lightning
speed; and Hitler assured the generals that this
would not lead to general war.What is noteworthy about Hitler’s policy from1937 to 1939 is the acceleration of pace – hisreluctance simply to await events and to exploit
suitable opportunities. He became more conﬁ-
dent and reckless; he wanted to carry through his
grand design without waiting much longer. He
became obsessed with his health, nerves andvarious disorders. He was ageing and would doso rapidly during the war. Such independence as
the army had retained, as a professional body
whose independent judgement was expressed on
the military feasibility of Hitler’s plans, was anobstacle to their realisation. The commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht as well as the war 226THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39

with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW,or high command of the armed forces). The
general staff of the army was subordinated to theOKW. The army was purged of generals unen-thusiastic about Nazi plans. The foreign minister,
Konstantin von Neurath, was also replaced – by
an ardent Nazi, Joachim von Ribbentrop – and
the diplomatic service was purged. Before
embarking on action, Hitler had thus powerfullystrengthened his authority.Hitler had no immediate plans for the annex-ation of independent Austria. Yet within a few
weeks it was a fact. The events as they unfolded
made possible a quick ﬁnish to Austria’s inde-pendence and convinced Hitler in the spring of1938 that the tide was running swiftly and
favourably towards Germany’s destiny. He had
wished to cow Austria into satellite status
without, for the time being, openly destroying itsindependence. From 1936 to February 1938 hesucceeded well with the Austrian chancellor,
Schuschnigg, who was ﬁnally summoned to his
mountain retreat at Berchtesgaden a month
before the Anschlussto be bullied into agreeingto make far-reaching further concessions to theNazis in Austria entailing the certain erosion ofwhat independence had remained. Deserted by
Mussolini, he had little choice but to agree to
German demands.Mussolini preferred a German alignment eversince his conﬂict with Britain over Italian aggres-sions in Abyssinia and involvement in Spain. He
was jealous of German success, but in 1936 bom-
bastically claimed that European affairs now
revolved around the Axis of Berlin and Rome. He
visited Hitler in September 1937 and wasimpressed by the spectacle of Germany’s mightand ﬂattered by the Führer’s attentions. He had
already secretly removed his objection to German
dominance over Austria and had been assured
that its independence would not be too blatantlydestroyed.That is one reason why Hitler as late as 28February 1938 sought an ‘evolutionary’ Austrian
course. But Schuschnigg in the end would notplay the game; the rabbit bolted. When hereturned to Austria he announced he would holda plebiscite on 13 March, intending to ask the
people whether they desired independence or
union with Germany. Despite the suppression of
the socialists and trade unions, who had no love
for Schuschnigg, their vote would have been cast
against Hitler’s Germany. Hitler demanded a
‘postponement’ of the plebiscite. Schuschnigg
conceded and resigned. But now the president
would not appoint the National Socialist nominee
in his place, a new demand. Göring, given respon-
sibility for the Austrian Nazi takeover, had com-
pleted the military preparations. On 12 March
1938 the Wehrmacht crossed the frontier; Hitlerfollowed close behind. There was no militaryopposition. Hitler was received in Linz with
cheers and ﬂowers by part of the population. He
decided on an instantaneous acceleration of his
plans. Instead of a gradual fusion of the two
countries, complete union, or the Anschluss, wasannounced on 13 March and later approved by a
charade of a plebiscite.It all happened so quickly that internationalreaction in the first place consisted merely of
some ineffectual protests. But this ruthless expan-
sion of Germany’s frontiers forced the British and
French governments into a fresh stock-taking.In February 1938 Eden resigned and Halifaxreplaced him at the Foreign Ofﬁce. Eden hadresigned over the immediate difference of opinion
with Prime Minister Chamberlain on whether
Mussolini should be appeased before he had given
concrete proof of abiding by international under-
takings and withdrawing troops from Spain. Eden
was testing the good faith of the dictators, while
Chamberlain was following a grand design of
foreign policy and was ready to subordinate ‘sec-
ondary’ questions to its fulﬁlment. Chamberlain’s
grand design for peace and stability involved
working separately on Hitler and Mussolini. His
ideas had already been clearly formulated the pre-
vious November 1937 when he sent Halifax, thenlord president of the Council and not foreign secretary, on a mission to Hitler. Halifax, accord-
ing to the ofﬁcial British record, told Hitler that
Britain accepted:1THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE, 1937–9227

The expansion of Germany, January 1935–October 1939possible alterations in the European orderwhich might be destined to come about withthe passage of time. Amongst these questions
were Danzig, Austria, Czechoslovakia. Britain
was interested to see that any alterationsshould come through the course of peacefulevolution ...
The German record is more pointed and hasHalifax expressing the view that he ‘did notbelieve that the status quo had to be main-
tained under all circumstances’. As further baits
to persuade Germany into the paths of peace,
Chamberlain was prepared to make economicconcessions and even envisaged some eventualAfrican colonial appeasement.Privately, Chamberlain explained to his sisterIda in November 1937 that he regarded the visit
a great success because it had created an atmos-phere that would make possible discussions withGermany on ‘the practical questions involved in
a European settlement’:What I wanted to do was to convince Hitlerof our sincerity and to ascertain what objec-
tives he had in mind ... Both Hitler and

Göring said separately and emphatically thatthey had no desire or intention of making warand I think we may take this as correct at any
rate for the present. Of course they want to
dominate Eastern Europe; they want as close
a union with Austria as they can get withoutincorporating her in the Reich and they wantmuch the same thing for the Sudeten Deutsch
as we did for the Uitlanders in the Transvaal.
... But I don’t see why we shouldn’t say to

Germany give us satisfactory assurances thatyou won’t use force to deal with the Austriansand Czecho-Slovakians and we will give you
similar assurances that we won’t use force to
prevent the changes you want, if you can getthem by peaceful means.The flaws in Chamberlain’s reasoning wereseveral and serious. First, it was wrong that Hitler
was pursuing a nationalist foreign policy thatcould be satisﬁed by limited territorial adjust-
ments. Down to the outbreak of war in 1939
Chamberlain failed to comprehend the centralracialist kernel of Hitler’s policy and therefore thesigniﬁcance of the persecution of the Jews. Thereis one interesting piece of evidence about this in
an unpublished private letter. His sister Hilda had
passed the absurd information to him that it was
possible for Jews to be admitted to the HitlerYouth, and Chamberlain replied in July 1939:I had no idea that Jews were still allowed towork or join such organisations as the Hitler
Youth in Germany. It shows, doesn’t it, how
much sincerity there is in the talk of racialpurity. I believe the persecution arose out of two motives: a desire to rob the Jews of
their money and a jealousy of their superior
cleverness.Chamberlain, unlike Churchill, did not havewarm feelings for Jews in general. He wrote that
he did not regard them a ‘lovable people’ but
condemned their persecution: ‘I don’t care about
them myself’ but that was not sufﬁcient reason tojustify pogroms. Chamberlain failed to grasp earlyon the limitless nature of Hitler’s demands. He
worked for a ‘reasonable’ settlement so that a
great war would be seen as a needless and crimi-
nal sacriﬁce of life.The second ﬂaw, which led to the taint ofmoral guilt, was that Chamberlain believed in thejustiﬁcation of the greater good, or more precisely
the avoidance of the greater evil, which for him
was a general war. This played into Hitler’s hands.
Hitler intended to secure the maximum advan-tages at minimum cost. He would thus withoutrisk of general war provide Germany with a strong
base before launching his ultimate wars of con-
quest. The sacrifices Chamberlain called for,
moreover, were not of British territory. It would
be the Austrians, Czechs and other ‘foreigners’who would actually suffer the consequences. So,too, the colonial concessions in Africa would be
offered largely at the expense of Portugal and
Belgium and, far more importantly, would have
placed racist Nazis in control of black peopleswhom they looked on as subhumans. It is doubt-ful whether Chamberlain really grasped this fact.The third ﬂaw was the weakening of Britain’sallies, actual and potential, on the continent. But1THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE, 1937–9229
Chamberlain was essentially right when heassessed the US as an unlikely ally at the outsetof any war in Europe. Whatever Roosevelt might
say, he was the prisoner of an overwhelmingly iso-
lationist Congress. Also Chamberlain was right
that no reliance could be placed on the SovietUnion, which was not ready for war and wouldnot ﬁght Germany in alliance with Britain and
France as long as she could divert the German
attack from her own territory.By the spring of 1938 the Anglo-Frenchalliance had reached a pretty low point. TheBritish Cabinet was forging ahead with the granddesign of Chamberlain’s peace policy, intermit-
tently consulting French ministers. A consistent
British policy was followed throughout 1938. It
was obvious that the German-speaking inhabi-
tants of Czechoslovakia would be the next target.Germany was informed that the November 1937
assurances to Hitler still held. Britain was willing
to come to an agreement over the Sudeten ques-
tion on Germany’s terms provided this could beaccomplished peacefully. The new French gov-ernment of Prime Minister Édouard Daladier and
Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet was promised
the support of the British alliance if Germany
launched an unprovoked attack on France. The
sting in this seemingly satisfactory guarantee wasthat it was not extended to the case where Francedeclared war on Germany in fulﬁlment of its com-
mitment to the Franco-Czechoslovakian alliance.
In this way the British alliance became a potent
weapon which Chamberlain and Halifax used toforce the French into line behind a policy of con-cessions to Germany at Czechoslovakia’s expense.
Not that the French had much spirit of resistance
given the pessimism of General Gamelin and the
British attitude. French policy too was to reach
agreement with Germany. The French consis-
tently sought to inﬂuence British policy, withoutever taking a position in advance of Britain’s
which risked war. France, the ministers had
decided in March 1938, ‘could only react to
events, she could not take the initiative’.In dealing with Germany, Britain offered thecarrot and the stick. The colonial, territorial and
economic carrots dangled before the Germans
have already been noted. The ‘stick’ consisted ofrefusing to bind Britain to neutrality if Hitler didresort to force. Chamberlain declared in theHouse of Commons after the Anschluss:His Majesty’s Government would not howeverpretend that, where peace and war are con-cerned, legal obligations are alone involvedand that if war broke out it would be likely to
be conﬁned to those who have assumed oblig-
ations. It would be quite impossible to say
where it might end and what Governments
might become involved.It was a clear warning to Hitler not to attackCzechoslovakia, though secretly the Cabinet had
already concluded that there was no way in which
Czechoslovakia could be helped militarily.Plans for attacking Czechoslovakia were discussedby Hitler and the generals in April 1938. To
ensure that Czechoslovakia would receive no sup-
port, a crisis was to be worked up. At the end ofMay Hitler declared to his generals his ‘unshake-able will that Czechoslovakia shall be wiped off
the map’. He signed a military directive which set
a ﬁnal date, 1 October 1938. He had been infuri-
ated by indications that Czechoslovakia would not
tamely submit as Austria had done. Rumours ofGerman military moves had in May led to a partialCzech mobilisation and warnings from Britain 
and France. He was not yet ready to smash
Czechoslovakia but soon would be.Among all the Eastern European states, onlyCzechoslovakia had retained its Western demo-
cratic constitution – an added reason to make it
unﬁt for German partnership. Another sin was the
prominent support Czech statesmen gave to the
ideals of the League of Nations. Czechoslovakia,
largely because of its national composition, facedgrave difﬁculties as a new successor state. In 1930the country was inhabited by 7.1 million Czechs,
3.3 million Germans, 2.6 million Slovaks, 720,000
Hungarians, 569,000 Ruthenes, 100,000 Poles
and a smaller number of Romanians andYugoslavs. The cohesion of the state depended onthe cooperation of Slovaks and Czechs as symbol-

ised by the founding fathers, Thomas Masaryk and
Eduard Benesˇ. The peasantry of Slovakia was230THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
administered mainly by the more educated Czechs,which caused discontent and the creation of aSlovak People’s Party, led by Father Hlinka,
demanding autonomy. But the most serious difﬁ-

culty was caused by relations with the German-
speaking ex-Habsburg population living inBohemia and Moravia and along the frontiers withGermany and the new Austria. Most of the
Germans, once the masters, now resented their
subordination to the ‘Slav’ state. Czech suspicions
of German loyalties and attempts to favour Czech
education and discriminate against Germansaroused anger and resentment.The depression of the 1930s and the conse-quent economic crisis sharpened nationality con-
flicts as both Slovaks and Sudeten Germans
blamed the Czechs. It coincided with the rise ofHitler, whose movement inspired imitations. InBohemia and Moravia Konrad Henlein led the
German National Front, which claimed rights for
the Germans within the state, but secretly in 1938
worked for its disruption and union withGermany. Meanwhile, Hitler publicly proclaimedthat he would ‘protect’ the Sudeten Germans,
who were unable to protect themselves. But not
all Germans were enamoured of the Nazis. A
signiﬁcant minority of Social Democrats opted for
Czechoslovakia out of hatred for Hitler. In 1938the Czechs made far-reaching attempts to satisfythe German minority in negotiations with
Henlein. But as Henlein had been told at a
meeting with Hitler always to ask for more than
the Czechs would accede to, these negotiationswere doomed. Despite the genuine catalogue ofinternal difﬁculties, the ‘multinational’ army was
patriotic and loyal and Czechoslovakia was in no
danger of internal disruption. It was Hitler’s
aggression and Anglo-French diplomacy that
destroyed Czechoslovakia in two stages, inSeptember 1938 and in March 1939.The agony of Czechoslovakia had its counter-part in Chamberlain’s triumphant reception after
saving the peace in September 1938. For the ﬁrst
time the Western democracies had been broughtto the brink of war. The German army highcommand was alarmed as well by Hitler’s tactics
and warned Hitler that the Wehrmacht was not
ready for war against France and Czechoslovakia.In August 1938 Colonel Ludwig Beck, the chiefof the army general staff, courageously resignedin protest at Hitler’s insistence that Czecho-

slovakia must be attacked regardless of the risks
of war with France. His successor was General
Halder. In August both Halder and Beck plottedagainst Hitler and planned to arrest him beforehe could plunge Germany into war. The attitude
of the majority of the army, including General
von Brauchitsch, the commander-in-chief, makes
it extremely doubtful whether the plot would
have succeeded had it ever materialised. Itdepended in part on the appeal sent to Londonsecretly urging Chamberlain to stand ﬁrm. Not
unreasonably, Chamberlain was not prepared to
risk the issue of war and peace on the success of
a few conspirators in Germany.Chamberlain was pursuing his own peacefulpolicy. He induced the Czech government to
‘invite’ Lord Runciman early in August to assist
as ‘mediator’ in the negotiations between the
Czech government and Henlein. In view ofHitler’s instructions to Henlein not to reach asettlement the mission was futile from the start.
On 7 September Henlein broke off the negotia-
tions. Hitler now deliberately worked for his
pretext to attack Czechoslovakia, having carefully
made all the necessary military preparations. Thelast stage of the German propaganda campaignbegan with Hitler’s attack on President Benes
ˇin a speech to the faithful at Nürnberg. But
Chamberlain now began to interfere with Hitler’s
well-laid plans. Chamberlain’s personal diplo-
macy, his ﬂight to visit Hitler at Berchtesgadenon 15 September, caught the public imagination
not only in Britain but also in Germany. He had
come to ﬁnd out what Hitler wanted. The crisis
would be solved by diplomacy not force. The
Czechs were diplomatically bludgeoned intoagreeing on the cession of the Sudeten region toGermany and the French were persuaded to
desert their Czech ally. But when Chamberlain
met Hitler with these fruits of his diplomacy on
a second occasion in Godesberg, the Führerrefused to give up the use of force andChamberlain broke off the negotiations. The
Czechs mobilised. It looked as if war might still
result.1THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE, 1937–9231
What made Hitler draw back on the brink atthe end of September and forgo his Blitzkriegor‘lightning war’? We can only surmise. He deliv-
ered another almost unbelievably insulting speech
abusing Benesˇon 26 September. But the likeli-
hood of war with France and Britain made Hitlerhesitate. A probable major inﬂuence on his deci-sion not to force a war was the ‘unsatisfactory’
state of German public opinion. Watching the
dramatic newsreels, the German cinema audiences
applauded the old gentleman with his umbrella so
determined to struggle for peace. The Germansfeared the consequences of another war withBritain and France. And so Hitler allowed
Mussolini the glory of arranging for a peaceful
outcome. A conference was called at Munich and
Hitler, Mussolini, Daladier and Chamberlainassembled on 29 September. By the early hoursof 30 September the formalities of arranging 
for a German occupation of the Sudeten areas
between 1 and 10 October were agreed and a few
other details such as a declaration that what wasleft of Czechoslovakia would be guaranteed oncethe Poles and Hungarians too were satisfied.
Chamberlain even got Hitler to sign the piece of
paper he waved at the airport on his return to
Britain promising to settle all future Anglo-
German differences by diplomacy. The Czechswere not allowed to participate. Nor were theRussians, who in 1938 were still the sworn
Bolshevik enemies of Nazi Germany.The new rump Czech–Slovak state did not lastlong, although she tried to avoid all offence inGermany. The Slovak autonomy movementproved disruptive and in March 1939 Hitler
browbeat the Czech president Hacha in Berlin to
sign away what was left of the independence of
his country. Göring threatened that he would
otherwise obliterate Prague with bombs. TheCzech will to resist had already been broken atMunich. On 15 March 1939 the Wehrmacht
moved in and Hitler hastened to Prague to savour
his new triumph. But his cynical breach of the
Munich settlement caused revulsion in the Westand the crowds that had so recently applaudedChamberlain on his triumphant return from
Munich demanded that something should now
be done to stop Hitler. Thirty-ﬁve well-equippedCzechoslovak divisions were lost to the Frenchally. Could the French without a ‘second front’in the east still check Germany on land? Fears
were voiced in the British Cabinet that France
might even abandon the British alliance and make
the best terms it could with Germany. Theseworries drove both the Cabinet and the militaryadvisers of the government to accept the need for
a continental commitment. At the end of March
1939 plans were approved which would double
the strength of the British Territorial Army from
thirteen to twenty-six divisions.Britain’s foreign policy now had to be aligned tothe recently perceived shift in the balance of power
on the European continent. After initial hesita-
tions Chamberlain responded in a speech he deliv-ered in Birmingham on 17 March 1939. Heaccused Hitler of breaking his word and taking the
law into his own hands, and asked rhetorically:232THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
Hitler and Mussolini, 1938. © Bettmann/CorbisIs this the end of an old adventure or is it thebeginning of a new? Is this the last attack upon
a small state or is it to be followed by others?
Is this, in effect, a step in the direction of an
attempt to dominate the world by force?In London, the Cabinet insisted on steps to createa deterrent alliance to save the peace if it could still
be saved. They believed that only the threat of
force might stop Hitler. Rumours of an impending
German ultimatum to Romania, false as it turnedout, served as the initial impetus which led to aunilateral Anglo-French guarantee, announced on
31 March 1939, to defend Romania and Poland
against German aggression. Although Chamber-

lain continued to place faith in conciliating Hitler,
he too was converted to the need for a deterrentalliance. Halifax and the Cabinet also urged thatthe alliance of the Soviet Union, too, should be
sought. A sceptical Chamberlain had to give way.The long and weary Anglo-French–Soviet negoti-
ations which followed lasted until 23 August 1939
when Stalin decided that Soviet interests were best
served by concluding a non-aggression treaty with
Nazi Germany instead.If Britain’s negotiations with Russia and itsguarantee (and later alliance) with Poland proveanything, it is that the British never sought to
embroil the Germans in a war with Russia while
they, themselves, stood aside. Hitler could have
invaded Russia on a broad front only by way ofPoland or Romania, and Britain’s policy had putup a barrier which could not be breached without
involving Britain and France in war as well. It was
ironic that the Western democracies should now
be aligned with authoritarian Poland, having sac-
riﬁced democratic Czechoslovakia.It has been argued that Britain and France wereunnecessarily dragged into war by the March 1939
guarantees to Poland. Hitler, so this reasoning

A world media event, note the number of microphones. © Underwood & Underwood Corbisruns, would have followed the attack on Polandwith an invasion of the Soviet Union. Would thisnot have been in Britain’s and France’s interest?
The speculation about beneﬁt is highly dubious.

The evidence, moreover, is by no means so con-

clusive. At various times after Munich Hitler spoke
of having to strike at France ﬁrst before turning

eastwards, on other occasions of ﬁnishing Poland

ﬁrst. He hoped by coercion and cajolery to keep
Britain neutral. Logically the strategy of the light-

ning war suggested a quick campaign against
Poland, then France, before resuming the war in
the east again. In any case this was the path Hitler
followed. Our uncertainty concerns only his timing
and strategic priorities.Hitler’s well-tried step-by-step policy ofaggrandisement entered a new phase in 1939. He
recognised that further bloodless successes were
unlikely; he welcomed the opportunity of war,
preferably against a small, weaker neighbour.
Britain and France fought in September 1939 not
because Hitler had then forced war on them.
They fought because there could no longer be
any doubt about the pattern of Hitler’s violence
nor about his ultimate goals. It would have been
madness to allow him to pick off his victims one
by one and to choose his time for overpowering
them while reassuring those whose turn had not
yet come. Belatedly, by September 1939, Hitlerwas no longer able to call the tune. ForChamberlain, Hitler’s choice of how to settle his
Polish demands was the ultimate test.The intricate diplomacy of the powers fromMarch to September 1939 can only be brieﬂy
summarised here. The British and French govern-
ments were still seeking a settlement with Hitler
and were even prepared to make far-reaching 
concessions to him after March 1939. They had
accepted his seizure of Memel on the Baltic only
a week after his entry into Prague. Poland, more-
over, had not been guaranteed unconditionally.
Its frontiers were not regarded as inviolate. As in the case of Czechoslovakia, if Hitler made ‘reasonable’ demands the Western powers hoped
that the Poles would be ‘reasonable’ too. What
the two Western powers ruled out, however, wasthat Hitler should simply seize what he wantedby launching with impunity a war against Poland.In October 1938 Poland was ﬁrst approachedby the Nazi foreign minister Ribbentrop with
demands that it return Danzig to Germany, create
an extra-territorial corridor to East Prussia and
join with Italy and Japan in the anti-communistalignment known as the Anti-Comintern Pact.Then in January 1939 the Polish foreign minister
Colonel Beck visited Hitler and was offered a
junior partnership as Germany’s ally, with pro-
mises of Czech territory and the Soviet Ukraine.During the earlier Czech crisis Hitler had alreadybeen helpful in permitting the Poles to acquire the
Czech territory of Teschen. It seems that because
of Poland’s strong anti-communist past, and the
‘racial’ mixture of Balt and Slav in the population,
Hitler was ready to see the ‘best’ Polish elementsas a suitable ally. Anti-Semitism and the Polishgovernment’s desire to force Poland’s own Jewish
population into emigration was another link
between them. But the Poles proved stubborn.
They overestimated the worth of their own armyand with a population of more than 34 millionregarded themselves as almost a great European
power. The cession of territory was anathema to
them; in Polish history cession of territory had
been the prelude to partition.Hitler had offered the Poles what amounted toan alliance in the east. Later, during the waragainst the Soviet Union, other Slav nations, the
Slovaks and Croats, were to become allies. Does
this mean that Hitler was ﬂexible about his deﬁ-
nition of ‘subhumans’ other than the Jews? MightPoland have been spared the carnage that fol-lowed? For 3 million Poles who were Jews the
outcome would have been no different; for the
rest of the Poles, of whom another 3 million were
murdered, the great majority would probablyhave survived the war as the Czechs did. But therejection by the Poles of Hitler’s offers as late as
1939 sealed their immediate fate.Beck’s rejection and the Anglo-French guar-antee determined Hitler to smash the Poles at the
ﬁrst opportunity. In May 1939 Germany and Italyostentatiously signed the bombastically namedPact of Steel which, by its terms, committed Italy
to go to war whenever Hitler chose that Germany234THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
would ﬁght, despite the duce’s explanations thatItaly would not be ready for war for another threeyears. The conquest of Abyssinia and the more
recent occupation of little Albania by Italian
troops (in April 1939) were one thing, war with
France and Britain quite a different prospect. Thealliance nevertheless served the purpose ofdashing any hopes Chamberlain might have had
left of detaching Italy from Germany after his
own abortive attempt to achieve this on a visit to
Rome the previous January. It was intended to
pressurise Britain into neutrality. Far moreimportant was the conclusion on 23 August of aNazi–Soviet pact, which Hitler hoped would con-
vince Britain and France that it was useless to
ﬁght for Poland.August 1939 turned out to be the last fullmonth of peace. The crisis started when Polandinsisted on its treaty rights in Danzig and Hitler
chose to regard this as a provocation. However,
Danzig was not the real issue; nor even was the
future of the territory lying between East Prussiaand the rest of Germany – the Polish corridor.Rather, it was that Hitler could not tolerate an
independent Poland which blocked his road to
Lebensraumin the east. The Poles were notimpressed either by efforts at intimidating them
by the Nazis on the one hand and pressure to be‘reasonable’ exerted by Britain and France on theother. They had no intention of suffering the fate
of Czechoslovakia. But the Chamberlain Cabinet
in London and Daladier’s government vainly
hoped that the dispute was about no more thanDanzig and the corridor and that war could beavoided if Poland gave way.However, from Hitler’s point of view, warwith France and Britain would only be post-
poned, not avoided, that is postponed until he
decided that the balance of power was mostadvantageously in Germany’s favour. To theextent that one can fathom Hitler’s mind, war
with Poland was by now a certainty. He told his
commanders-in-chief on 22 August that the
destruction of Poland was necessary even if itmeant conﬂict with Britain and France. He addedthat he did not believe it likely that Britain and
France would go to war. What was desirable,
politically and militarily, was not a settling of allaccounts, but concentration on single tasks.Hitler had no intention of allowing the British orFrench any role as mediators.According to Hitler’s original plans, the attackon Poland was to begin on 26 August. On 25
August at 3 p.m. the order to attack was givenand then, much to the annoyance of the Wehrma-cht countermanded at 7 p.m. when the final 
troop movements were already under way. The
attack was postponed by Hitler for a few days.
How significant was the postponement? Was
there a real chance of peace somehow missed by lack of communication or misunderstanding?Chamberlain was aware of the parallel with July
1914. In a personal letter to Hitler on 22 August
he made it clear that Britain would stand by its
Polish commitments regardless of the German–Soviet pact. Hitler received the letter on 23August. The flurry of negotiations principally
between London and Berlin during the last days
of peace were undertaken by Britain to induce
Germany and Poland to negotiate the differencesover Danzig and the corridor. In that respectthere was a parallel between the Czech crisis of
1938 and the Polish crisis. Britain and France
would have acquiesced in any territorial gains
Germany succeeded in obtaining from Poland
without use of force. Mere German blackmail hadbecome almost an acceptable fact of life as far asdiplomacy was concerned. But if Germany
attacked Poland to gain her ends by force then
there was no doubt that Britain would support
Poland by declaring war on Germany. The BritishCabinet knew no other policy was possible andthat the country would not accept another
Munich, especially with the Poles, unlike the
Czechs, fighting for their country. In France,
Daladier ﬁrmly controlled his government and
Bonnet, the foreign minister, counted for littlenow; there was no doubt here, too, that an actualGerman invasion of Poland meant war.That is not to say that Britain and Francewanted to ﬁght Germany. Quite the contrary; the
two governments were ready to talk and negoti-ate as long as Hitler did not actually attack. Therewas no certainty in their minds that he would
actually go to war – so talk they did from 25
August until the outbreak of war with Poland,1THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE, 1937–9235
and even for two days beyond that. Only Hitlerwas sure that he was going to attack Poland andthat his military timetable allowed only a few
days’ leeway. He used these days not to make any
genuine attempt to draw back from the war with
Poland, but to try to persuade Britain and Franceto abandon it. He wanted to postpone war withthem until after Poland had been defeated and so
avoid, if he could, a war on two fronts. Hitler
concentrated on Britain. The most dramatic day
of the crisis in Berlin was 25 August. At 1.30 p.m.
Hitler talked to the British ambassador, NevileHenderson, and he put on a very good act; hedeclared that he wanted to live on good terms
with Britain, that he would personally guarantee
its world empire, that Germany’s colonial
demands were limited and that his offer of ageneral settlement would follow the solution ofthe Polish–German disputes, which in any case he
was determined to settle. This, he emphasised,
was his last offer. He overdid it a little, stretching
credulity too far by conﬁding to Henderson thatonce the Polish question was out of the way hewould conclude his life as an artist and not as a
war-maker.About half an hour after Henderson had leftthe chancellery in Berlin to ﬂy with this offer to
London, Hitler ordered the attack on Poland tocommence the following day. The war machinewas set in motion at 3 p.m. At 5.30 p.m. Hitler
received the French ambassador to tell him
Germany wanted to live at peace with France and
that the issue of peace and war was up to theFrench. But Hitler was unsettled that afternoonby the news of the imminent conclusion of the
Anglo-Polish alliance, and by Mussolini’s message
revealing his unwillingness to join Germany in
war. In London, meanwhile, the news that the
Soviet Union and Germany had signed a treaty,and that the Anglo-French alliance negotiationswith Russia had thus ended in failure, meant that
nothing now stood in the way of the formal con-
clusion of the Anglo-Polish alliance, which was
signed on 25 August. It promised Poland thatBritain would go to war with Germany ifGermany attacked Poland. In Berlin it was
dawning on Hitler that Britain might not simply
desert Poland the very moment Germany attackedit. Then, in the late afternoon of 25 August,Mussolini informed Hitler that Italy did not havethe resources to go to war.Not surprisingly Hitler now thought itprudent to give his ‘offer’ to Britain a last chance
of being accepted and not to jeopardise his over-ture by simultaneously attacking Poland. Hitlerdid not rely on Henderson alone. Göring had ini-
tiated the use of an unofﬁcial emissary, Birger
Dahlerus, a Swedish businessman, who shuttled
between London and Berlin from 25 to 30
August. After his ﬁrst return from London he sawboth Göring and Hitler; unwittingly he became atool of Hitler’s diplomacy to detach Britain from
Poland. If that succeeded, then France also could
be counted on to remain out of the war. The
British reply on 28 August to Hitler’s ‘last’ offerwas to welcome the opportunity of an Anglo-German settlement, but not at Poland’s expense.
Instead, the British Cabinet urged direct
Polish–German negotiations, offered to act as
mediators and informed Hitler that the Poleswere willing to enter such negotiations. Germanywas warned against the use of force. Henderson
saw Hitler on the 28th and again on the evening
of 29 August when Hitler angrily conceded direct
negotiations – solely, so he claimed, to prove his
desire for lasting friendship with Britain. Suchproof, he hoped, would dissuade the British fromsupporting an unreasonable Poland. As Goebbels
recorded in his diary, Hitler’s aim was ‘to decou-
ple Warsaw from London and still ﬁnd an excuse
to attack’.Hitler demanded that a special envoy mustreach Berlin the very day following, on 30
August. Henderson was upset by the peremptory
German reply. He gave as good as he got, shout-
ing back at Hitler and warning him that Britain
was just as determined as Germany and wouldﬁght. The British Cabinet refused to ‘mediate’what amounted to an ultimatum. The German
demands were unknown yet Hitler was insisting
that the Poles should come immediately to Berlin
to settle all that Germany required within a timelimit of only a few hours. The time limit wasignored in London and discussions about starting
direct negotiations were still proceeding on 31
August. Hitler’s time limit for a Polish plenipo-236THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
tentiary to present himself in Berlin expired atmidnight on 30 August. The Poles were not pre-pared to rush cap in hand to Hitler.Polish policy has been characterised as suicidal.How could the Poles hope to maintain their inde-
pendence sandwiched, as they were, betweenGermany and the Soviet Union? It is perfectlytrue that Poland’s military situation in September
1939 was hopeless. The Poles overrated their
capacity to resist in the short term. So did the
French commander-in-chief, General Gamelin,
who expected the Poles to be able to hold outuntil the following spring. The Poles also countedon effective help from France and Britain. There
was logic and reason in Poland’s refusal to con-
template signiﬁcant concessions to Germany in
1939. The recent example of Czechoslovakiashowed only too clearly that independence couldnot be bought for long by making concessions to
Hitler. Once started on that road, the Poles
believed with good reason, the end at best would
be that they might be permitted to remainGermany’s satellite. So they reasoned that if theGermans intended the destruction of Polish inde-
pendence, it would be better to ﬁght them at the
outset with Britain and France as allies than to
accept piecemeal subordination to Germany and
to risk the loss of the French and British alliance.Furthermore, there was just the possibility thatHitler’s objectives were limited to Danzig and
access, through the Polish corridor. For such aims
alone, Hitler, so they thought, might not risk a
great European war. But if his aims were notlimited, then Poland’s only choice was to submitor ﬁght. Accordingly the Polish government came
to the conclusion that Poland’s national interests
were best served by resisting Hitler’s territorial
demands, by holding tight and so testing his real
intentions. Hitler’s determination, the Polesvainly hoped, might crack if his policy was basedon bluff.Did this Polish attitude then dash hopes of apeaceful settlement? That would have been so
only to the extent that, if the Polish governmenthad submitted to whatever Hitler demanded inAugust 1939, then France and Britain would have
had no cause for war in September 1939. But
while the British Cabinet and the French govern-ment were anxious for the Poles to explore all pos-sibilities of a peaceful settlement with Germany byopening direct negotiations with Hitler, they did
not expect the Poles simply to submit to time lim-
its and the threat of force. Hitler, too, would have
to demonstrate Germany’s desire for peace byputting forward reasonable terms for a settlement,and by negotiating in a reasonable way without
ultimatums.At ﬁrst sight he appeared to be putting forwardwhat in London and Paris might be considered
‘reasonable’ terms. The German demands wereembodied in sixteen points; they struck theBritish ambassador in Berlin as moderate, when
he eventually heard what they were. They
included the immediate takeover by Germany of
Danzig and a plebiscite later in the corridor todecide whether it was to remain Polish or becomeGerman, with the loser being granted extra-
territorial rights across the strip of territory. But
the method of negotiation belied the apparent
moderation of the sixteen points. They weredrawn up in strict secrecy and not communicateduntil after the time set for the appearance in
Berlin of a Polish plenipotentiary with full powers
to negotiate. In fact, they ﬁrst reached the ears of
the British ambassador just after midnight – in the
early hours of 31 August. Henderson had calledon the German foreign minister, Ribbentrop,who after a stormy discussion pulled a piece of
paper out of his pocket and then read the sixteen
demands aloud in German, according to
Henderson, at ‘top speed’. Ribbentrop addedthat since no Pole had arrived they were super-seded anyway. He refused the ambassador’s
request for a copy. Henderson was astonished at
this breach of diplomatic practice and had to rely
on his memory for the gist of the proposals.Henderson in Berlin, and Halifax in London,nevertheless tried to persuade the Poles to actquickly to open discussions in Berlin. Not until
noon on 31 August did Dahlerus, the innocent
intermediary, who was being used by Göring and
Hitler in an attempt to keep Britain out of thewar, communicate the full terms to the Britishand Polish ambassadors in Berlin. All the efforts
of the professional and amateur diplomats were in
vain. The sixteen points and Hitler’s diplomatic1THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN EUROPE, 1937–9237
manoeuvres in August were designed to providean alibi to put the Poles in the wrong and sojustify war to the German people. Furthermore,
Hitler almost to the last seemed to have had some
hopes that, if the Poles could be shown to be
unreasonable, then France and Britain wouldrefuse to live up to their alliance commitments.But in the last resort he was prepared to risk war
with France and Britain rather than abandon the
war he was preparing to launch against Poland.
The first order to the Wehrmacht, to attack
Poland at 4.35 a.m. on 1 September, reached thearmy high command at 6.30 a.m. on 31 August,that is, several hours before the full text of the
‘moderate’ proposals was communicated to the
British and Polish ambassadors in Berlin. It was
ﬁnally conﬁrmed by Hitler at 4 p.m., little morethan three hours after the full text of the sixteenpoints was ﬁrst revealed.Hitler was driven by his conviction that theWehrmacht, navy and Luftwaffe needed a
Feuertaufe, a baptism of ﬁre, to maintain theirﬁghting ﬁbre. The German people too had to betaught to accept a real war, not be softened into
believing that every victory would be bloodless.
Hitler did not hesitate for long. If war with
Poland risked a great European war, that risk had
to be taken. As Henderson later wrote in hismemoirs, the conclusion that Hitler did not wantto negotiate at all on the basis of these proposals
is inescapable.The invasion of Poland began at 4.45 a.m. on1 September. Now it is true that in both Paris andLondon, while Poland fought back, the ministerswere still clutching at hopes of restoring peace
even less substantial than straws. Mussolini offered
again, as at the time of Munich, his mediation and
held out hopes that another conference of thepowers might be called. But the British Cabinetmade it a ﬁrm precondition that Germany shouldﬁrst withdraw its troops from Poland. As Hitler
would never have accepted this, Mussolini told 
the British and French that there was no point 
in his attempting further mediation. Meanwhile,between Paris and London, there was an extraor-dinary lack of coordination on the very eve of the
war. On 1 September, Germany was warned about
the consequences of war on Poland only by
Britain. On 2 September, Chamberlain faced a
hostile and suspicious House of Commons. Wasanother Munich in the making? But there was nochance that Britain and France this time could
avoid war. On 3 September, separate British and
French ultimatums led to the declaration of war
on Germany, the French actually going to war afew hours after the British, though they did notstart attacking Germany for a while longer, and
then only ineffectually.There could be no other outcome but aEuropean war once Hitler had decided to attackPoland. Not a single country in Europe wished toattack Germany, but in September 1939 the
British and French governments were forced to
the conclusion that they must ﬁght in their own
defence and not allow Hitler to pick off one
European state after another. There can be littledoubt that this is precisely what Hitler wouldhave done had he been allowed his war against
the Poles. Hitler’s aggression against Poland,
despite the clear warnings he received of its con-
sequences on the one hand and the perception ofthe British and French governments of his realintentions after the unprecedented concessions to
his demands in the previous year on the other,
thus led to the outbreak of the second great
European war within twenty-ﬁve years of the ﬁrst.238THE CONTINUING WORLD CRISIS, 1929–39
1Part V
THE SECOND WORLD WAR
During the ﬁrst two years of war, Germany wona series of victories on the continent of Europe
that staggered the world and made the Wehr-
macht appear invincible. Apprehensive at theoutset, the German people were intoxicated bymilitary success; all that Hitler had done appeared
justiﬁed. The nightmare that the experiences of
the First World War would be repeated seemed
for the Germans no more than a bad dream in
1940. Europe learned the reality of the Blitzkrieg.The Wehrmacht used the tactics of speedy pene-tration by tanks, followed by mechanised infantry
and then more slowly by infantry on foot, sup-
ported closely by the Luftwaffe; towns were sub-
jected to indiscriminate bombing, and theterrorised populations jammed the roads toescape the advancing Germans. The Blitzkriegrequired careful planning, a well-coordinated
command structure and highly disciplined, well-
equipped troops. The armed forces, from the
most senior officers to the newest conscripts,served Hitler’s cause, which they identiﬁed withGermany’s, with efﬁciency and the utmost devo-
tion. The home front supplied the means. It was
their war, too, though Hitler’s lightning wars did
not require the entire mobilisation of the homefront as in Britain. Women were not conscriptedand luxury items continued to be produced to
keep the Germans happy. Military victory alone
made possible the horrors that Hitler’s regime
inﬂicted on the millions of people who fell intoGermany’s grasp.In September 1939 Poland was conquered; inApril 1940, Denmark and Norway; during May
the Netherlands and Belgium; and then in June
1940 the greatest victory of all, France wasdefeated. With France prostrate, Britain withdrewfrom the continent of Europe. Did not the ‘good’
which Hitler had achieved outweigh the ‘bad’? –
so many Germans now reasoned. Hitler even
publicly offered peace to Britain. In July 1940 the
war, so it seemed, was virtually over, an astonish-ingly short war rather than the expected long andbloody struggle, leaving Germany victorious.
Why were these German dreams shattered so
soon?Hitler was not satisfied with what he hadachieved so far. He had not won sufficientLebensraumin the east or the undisputed hege-mony of Europe. Any ‘peace’ for him now would
have been tactical and short-lived. Everything he
said to his associates, either secretly at the time or
in conversations and writings before, points to thefact that he regarded the victory in the west asonly a prelude to greater conquests. Plans for a
great ﬂeet had been carried forward not with a
view to winning the continental European war
but with an eye to the wars after that, includingthe world war with the British Empire and theUS. The struggle would continue as long as
Hitler lived and until Europe was racially trans-
formed and world power was won; but Hitler
proceeded according to his own timetable. TheGermans were not allowed for long to enjoy the1Chapter 22GERMANY’S WARS OF CONQUEST IN
EUROPE, 1939–41fruits of victory, the victory parades accompaniedby champagne and other luxuries looted fromFrance. Hitler’s megalomania was Germany’s
undoing. Its defeat then was so complete that it
is easy to overlook the fact that four years earlier
it had been a much more close-run thing.Germany’s defeat of Poland was rapid.Surrounded, Warsaw resisted until 27 September
1939. Badly led, the Poles bravely fought the
Wehrmacht, which enjoyed overwhelming
strength. In the earliest days of the war, the
Luftwaffe destroyed the Polish air force, mostlyon the ground. Any chance the Poles had ofholding out a little longer was lost when the
Russians on 17 September invaded from the east
in accordance with their secret agreement with
Germany of the previous August. Still it was nowalkover. The Poles inﬂicted heavy casualties andthe Wehrmacht was in no fit state to switch
immediately to the west and to attack France in
November 1939 as Hitler desired.Hitler’s public ‘peace’ proposals to Britain andFrance early in October 1939, after the victoriousPolish campaign, were almost certainly meant for
German public opinion. He would not, of course,
have rejected the idea that Britain should accept
and withdraw from involvement on the continent.
Then France could not have continued the waron its own and would have been in his powereven without a battle. Did Britain contemplate
any sort of peace? Whatever differences of opinion
may have existed, peace terms involving the even-
tual abandonment of France were unthinkable in1939.Militarily, on land and in the air, the warscarcely got started in terms of real ﬁghting on
the western front. The French were not ready to
take quickoffensive action against the weak screenof German troops facing them behind the incom-plete fortiﬁcations of the Siegfried Line. By thetime the army was fully mobilised and in a state
of readiness for offensive action – had the 
commander-in-chief, Maurice Gamelin, desired 
it – the Polish campaign was drawing to its closeand the German high command was rushing reinforcements westwards from Poland. The mil-
itary inaction on land corresponded to the doc-
trine, Poland notwithstanding, that the army thatattacked would be forced to suffer huge casual-ties. All the advantage was believed to lie with thedefence behind such powerfully constructed for-
tiﬁcations as the Maginot Line. In preparing the
defence of France, one section of the front – the
Franco-Belgian frontier to the Channel – hadbeen left ‘open’, designed to act as a limitedregion for offensive manoeuvre. But when the
Belgians returned to a position of complete neu-
trality in 1936 this strategy was more difﬁcult to
execute. The Anglo-French campaign plan of
1939–40 was nevertheless designed to meet theexpected German advance through Belgium, by aforward movement of their own into Belgium the
moment the Germans attacked that country; no
earlier move was possible as the Belgians fearfully
clung to absolute neutrality.These military assumptions about how best toconduct the war were paralleled by political
assumptions held by Chamberlain about the war
and its likely outcome. It would be ended, if possi-

ble, without great sacriﬁce of life by imposing a
strict blockade on Germany. The British andFrench governments even considered blowing up
the sources of Germany’s oil supplies in Romania
and the Soviet Caucasus. With neutral Scandinavia,
the Balkan states and the Soviet Union delivering
oil and other essential raw materials, the Britishblockade by sea was far less effective than duringthe First World War. It did not seriously impede
Hitler’s intended lightning strikes against the
West. For fear of massive reprisals, the French and
British dropped nothing more lethal than pam-
phlets on the industrial Ruhr. But thenChamberlain did not believe that the war would be
won by military force. In December 1939 he wrote
to the archbishop of Canterbury, ‘I feel before
another Christmas comes the war will be over, and
then the troubles will really begin!’. What was inhis mind when he wrote that? Was it that heexpected reasonable negotiations and a peace
treaty? He certainly thought that the war would
end in a stalemate and that, once the Germans
were convinced that they could not win, theywould negotiate for peace. The war would be wonon the home front. Chamberlain was certainly anx-

ious whether the British people would stand for a
long stalemated kind of war. He feared there was242THE SECOND WORLD WAR
in Britain a ‘peace at any price’ party whose inﬂu-
ence might become powerful. He thought it prob-
able nevertheless that the German home front
would crack ﬁrst, forcing Hitler into the wrong
policy of attack.Whether all aspects of ‘appeasement’ com-
pletely ended after the outbreak of war inSeptember 1939 poses questions that can, as yet,
be answered only tentatively. From existing evi-
dence we can reasonably conclude that Chamber-
lain would never have consented to peace on
Hitler’s terms; also that Chamberlain thoughtBritain and France would not be able to imposea Carthaginian peace on Germany. He appears to
have thought that some reshufﬂe of power setting
Hitler aside might offer a solution. ‘Until he dis-
appears and his system collapses there can be nopeace’, he wrote a week after the outbreak of thewar. Chamberlain’s assumptions were mistaken.
Events turned out very differently, when what was
to him the unthinkable occurred and the French
armies collapsed. Only then did the pre-war illu-sions on which policies had been based for solong ﬁnally collapse.While at sea Britain had the better of the war,serious ﬁghting on land began not on the fron-
tiers of France but in Norway. Winston Churchill
had rejoined the Cabinet as first lord of the admiralty at the beginning of the war and wasanxious that some visible blow be struck at
Germany’s war effort. The attack by the Soviet
Union on Finland on 30 November 1939 seemed
to provide a good opportunity. Swedish iron orewas vital to the German war machine. During the winter months it was shipped through the
Norwegian port of Narvik. For weeks, under
Chamberlain’s chairmanship, the Cabinet dis-

cussed the possibility of an operation that would
disrupt its ﬂow. The favourite idea was to help theFinns against the Russians by sending volunteerswho would, on the way so to speak, control the
railway line from northern Sweden to the coast.
This scheme made use of the public indignation
in the West about Russia’s attack to damage bothGermany and the Soviet Union, which was seenas Germany’s partner in the European war of
aggression. The Finns successfully resisted the ill-
prepared Soviet troops for weeks, inﬂicting heavycasualties on them in what became known as theWinter War.The French, too, were keen to ﬁght, but notin France. They agreed in February 1940 to a
joint Anglo-French expedition of ‘volunteers’ to
aid the Finns and occupy the strategic northernrailway. British scruples about infringing neutralrights, and Norway’s terriﬁed adherence to neu-
trality – the Norwegians did not wish to give
Germany an excuse for invasion – led to delays,
until ﬁnally the British decided to mine the waters
off Narvik through which the ore ships sailed(though only until spring had opened the otherroute by way of the Baltic, blocked by ice in the
winter). Before an expedition could be sent to the
Finns, however, they were defeated, making peace
on 12 March 1940. French politicians were sooutraged at the inability of the government tohelp that Daladier’s ministry fell; the more mili-
tant Paul Reynaud became prime minister.
Chamberlain’s own fall was delayed by another
month and historically was far more important.The public was tiring of the phoney war andthe easy successes of the dictators, Hitler and
Stalin. Poland and now Finland had fallen. Fortu-
nately the British Cabinet (unlike the French)
never contemplated any steps that might lead to
outright war with the Soviet Union as well, eventhough, or perhaps because, the Soviet Unionrepresented a far greater threat to Britain’s impe-
rial interests than to France. Chamberlain was sin-
gularly unlucky in some of his public utterances.
After Munich he had rashly repeated the phraseabout ‘peace in our time’. Early in April 1940 hecoined one phrase too many when he told the
nation that Hitler ‘has missed the bus’. After 
relatively small forces had secretly begun the
operation at sea on 3 April 1940, the main force
following during the night of 7 and 8 April, theGermans in a daring move occupied all Norway’smajor ports, including the capital, Oslo, on 9
April. The Norwegians resisted and inﬂicted casu-
alties, especially on the German warships making
for Oslo’s harbour. But Germany’s attack wasalmost entirely successful, even though it was not a complete surprise to Britain and France.
The British navy missed the German warships.
Executing the policy decided on by the Cabinet,1GERMANY’S WARS OF CONQUEST IN EUROPE, 1939–41243
the Royal Navy on 8 April was proceeding to laymines in Norwegian territorial waters accompa-nied by a small force of troops which was ready
to land in Norway should the Germans retaliate
by invading. In fact, they had already anticipated
the British move. The instructions to the Britishforce were unclear and reveal Britain’s moraldilemma about landing in Norway if the
Norwegians chose to resist.Only in the extreme north, in Narvik, wereAnglo-French forces able to inﬂict a temporary
setback to the small German forces far from theirbase. The British navy sank the German destroy-ers in the port and a month later Narvik was reoc-
cupied. After Dunkirk, these forces had to be
withdrawn and the whole of Norway fell under
German occupation. Nevertheless, German navallosses had been so severe that in July 1940 therewas no surface ﬂeet in active service; only a few
lighter warships were undamaged.The most important political consequence of act-ing too late in Norway was the fall of theChamberlain Cabinet, and the outcome – surpris-
ing at the time of the crisis – was that Winston
Churchill became prime minister on 10 May 1940
of a national government joined by Labour and
the Liberals. With the passage of time the adula-tion of Churchill as war leader has rightly givenplace to a more critical assessment of his role in
policy making at home, in foreign relations and in
military strategy, which together make up the con-
duct of the war. Churchill’s shortcomings standrevealed. By ﬁlling in the shadows, showing hismistakes as well as his successes, Churchill
becomes more real and believable. The shadows
only bring into sharper relief the predominance of
that galvanising spirit, the enormous energy and
undaunted faith in ﬁnal victory that became anasset of inestimable value to Britain and to the wareffort of the whole alliance. And, despite wartime
restrictions, Churchill still led a democracy rooted
in Parliament, and was dependent upon the sup-
port of the people. The nation thrilled by therhetoric of his radio speeches and sensed thatBritain now had a war leader who was a match for
Hitler. Churchill, more than any single man, sus-
tained national morale and hope in the future.It is therefore all the more remarkable that thesecrets now emerging from private papers and
ofﬁcial records reveal how insecure Churchill’s
position really was during the ﬁrst four months ofhis administration. Chamberlain was no brokenreed. His government had actually won what
amounted to a vote of conﬁdence, though many
Conservatives had abstained or voted with the
Opposition. Chamberlain was deeply injured byso many of his former supporters turning againsthim. It was he who decided that for the ‘dura-
tion’ what was required was a truly national gov-
ernment. But he would remain leader of the
Conservative Party and thought that he might
return to power when sanity returned; the timewould come when his unrivalled experiencewould be needed to bring back peace. As yet he
had no inkling of the cancer that, within a few
weeks, turned him into an invalid and caused his
death early in November 1940. Churchill wasprime minister, but Chamberlain and Halifaxremained the most powerful Conservatives in the
Cabinet. When Churchill ﬁrst presented himself244THE SECOND WORLD WAR
A war leader. Winston Churchill, 1941. © Bettmann/Corbisto the House of Commons, it was Chamberlainwhom the Conservatives loudly cheered. Cham-berlain was soon to earn those cheers for far more
than his readiness to accept second place under
Churchill.Norway was a serious defeat for the Allied wareffort. The Norwegian fjords could now serve asideal bases for the German submarines threaten-
ing to sever the lifeline of war supplies crossing
the Atlantic from the US. The most shattering
blow of all was the defeat of France, on whose
armies the containment of Germany overwhelm-ingly rested. It seemed unthinkable that a greatpower such as France would succumb as quickly
and as totally to the onslaught of the Blitzkriegas smaller nations like Poland and Norway had
done. Yet that is what occurred.The military debacle of the Allied campaign inFrance can be briefly summarised. The total
strength of the German army on the one hand
and the French, British, Belgian and Dutch forces
on the other were roughly comparable, as werethe numbers of tanks on each side. Arguably theFrench had the edge in the quality of their tanks
and artillery. Germany achieved superiority in the
air but this in itself was not decisive and, contrary
to popular belief, the Maginot Line, to which so
much blame came to be attached, was of advan-tage to the Allies: it deterred the Germans fromattacking more than half the frontier and it could
be held by a relatively small force. This meant that
the Allies did not have to concentrate on the
Franco-German border but could predict that themain battles would occur in the regions notcovered by the Maginot Line. The Allies then had
apparently good reason for quiet confidence
before the Germans opened the offensive.The Allies thought that the obvious route ofinvasion lay through the north, the Netherlandsand Belgium, and made their plans accordingly.The Germans, when they attacked, should not be
allowed to turn industrial northern France
immediately into a battle zone as they had done in
the First World War. The French and British forceswould, and did, have time to meet the Germanthrust in Belgium before it reached France. The
Maginot Line ran alongside the whole frontier
with Germany, alongside that of Luxembourg andalongside the southern tip of the Belgian frontier.Just beyond was the heavily wooded Ardennesregion, believed by the Allies to be impassable to
any major German offensive with tanks; this sec-

tion of the front was lightly held. Beyond the
Maginot Line to the sea, one careful calculation –others did not differ appreciably – indicated thatforty French divisions and nine British were facing
two German armies totalling seventy-four divi-
sions. But alongside the Allies another twenty-two
Belgian divisions were expected to ﬁght, even dis-

counting ten Dutch divisions which were quicklyoverwhelmed. The purely Anglo-French/Germandisparity would have disappeared if thirty-five
French and one British division had not been
allotted to the Maginot Line and upper Rhine.
Germany’s success was based not on superiority ofnumbers or equipment but on taking and choosingthe offensives and in so distributing the German
divisions that they would appear in overwhelming
strength at the weak point of the Allied front. The
massed, coordinated use of armour would ensurethat the initial breakthrough could be exploitedwith great speed.The Allies had anticipated no major thrustthrough the Ardennes and the Germans achieved
complete surprise there. The second unexpected
development was the direction of the thrust. TheFrench high command thought in terms of 1914.They expected the Germans would continue
straight from Sedan in a south-westerly direction
for Paris. Instead, in a great arc the massed Panzers
coordinated with aircraft followed by infantry,turned west towards the Channel coast atAbbeville, and north-west to Boulogne, Calais and
in the direction of Dunkirk. The BEF (the British
Expeditionary Force) and northern French armies
were now caught in a nutcracker, with one
German army pressing them through Belgium andthe other swinging behind their rear. It was like amirror image of the Schlieffen Plan and had the
advantage that the wheel to the coast was a ﬁnite

and limited distance, whereas Schlieffen’s arc had
been huge, and of virtually indeﬁnite length. Had
the Wehrmacht attacked in November 1939, theplan would then have corresponded to Anglo-
French expectations of an offensive predominantly
through Belgium, the old Schlieffen formula.1GERMANY’S WARS OF CONQUEST IN EUROPE, 1939–41245
In short, German victory was due to the bril-liance of the amended war-plan carried out inMay 1940, its successful execution by the German
high command and the ﬁghting qualities of the
well-trained troops, particularly the Panzer divi-
sions. Obversely, Allied failure was primarily afailure of strategy. French armies were throwninto total confusion, their generals lost control
over communications and over the movements of
whole armies. No soldier can successfully ﬁght in
such a situation, except in local actions. Later, the
generals and politicians were quick to blame allsorts of factors – the communists, sabotage, poorequipment, low morale – as having greatly con-
tributed to defeat. The blame must lie over-

whelmingly with Gamelin and the Allied generals
themselves.The devastating timetable of defeat can betersely set out. On 10 May 1940 the Germans
launched the western offensive, simultaneously
attacking the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxem-
bourg. The terror-bombing and destruction ofRotterdam added a new term to the war vocab-ulary. The French and British troops moved
forward according to a plan which, as it turned
out, placed them more securely in the noose. On
13 May the Germans broke through on the
Meuse. The French prime minister Reynaud tele-phoned Churchill the following day telling himthat the situation was grave, and on the 15th that
the battle was lost, the way to Paris open.The ﬁrst rift now appeared between the Britishand French conduct of the war. The Frenchwanted the outcome of the whole war to dependon the battle for France. Churchill already foresaw
that if indeed the battle for France was lost the
war would go on. There would then be the battle
for Britain. So 15 May 1940 is an important date.
Reynaud appealed to Britain to throw the wholeof its air force into the battle as the only chanceleft to stop the Germans. Churchill and the
Cabinet were ready to send further squadrons of
fighters to France. But twenty-five squadrons
would be retained as indispensable for the defenceof Britain, as the commander-in-chief of ﬁghtercommand, Air Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding,
insisted that this represented the minimum nec-
essary protection. On 15 May, to Reynaud’s des-perate plea, Churchill responded: ‘we would doeverything we could, but we could not denudeEngland of her essential defences’.On 16 May Churchill crossed the Channel tosee the situation for himself and to infuse some
of his ﬁghting spirit into Reynaud’s government.The full disaster became evident, there was nearpanic in Paris. Gamelin was dismissed and
replaced by General Weygand on 19 May. But
Hitler had slowed the advance to the Channel.
He did not wish to risk his tanks in unsuitable
terrain; to Göring and his Luftwaffe was to be lefta share in annihilating the trapped British. Thetanks were temporarily halted. General de Gaulle,
of later fame, managed a small-scale counter-
attack on 17 May but it could not affect the
outcome of the battle. In the north the BEF andFrench divisions were retreating in good order –much too slowly. On 20 May Reynaud had
brought Marshal Pétain into his new government.
Defeat was in the air. On 24 May the German
Panzers reached the coast at Abbeville on themouth of the Somme. The Allied northern armieswere now cut off.The story of the French capitulation is wellknown. Increasingly the French began to blame
the British for not throwing their last reserves into
the battle. They could not conceive how Britainwould continue the war without France. Churchillwas back in Paris on 23 May to discover how the
northern Allied armies including the BEF might
be saved. It was trapped, he reported back to the
War Cabinet in London the next day. On 25 May,General Lord Gort, the commander of the BEF,in spite of instructions on the 19th from Churchill
and the chiefs of staff to link with the French,
independently began the manoeuvre, subse-
quently approved, that eventually made it possible
to save the British divisions, and many Frenchtroops too, from the beaches of Dunkirk. Wey-gand’s planned counter-offensive against the
German ﬂanks never had a chance; there were no
French forces left who could seriously threaten the
Germans. Meanwhile in Paris on the night of 25May Pétain and other members of the govern-ment were already searching for a way to conclude
a separate peace with Germany. Prime Minister
Reynaud was despatched to London to sound out246THE SECOND WORLD WAR
British reactions to peace initiatives. That sameday contingency arrangements to evacuate theBEF were acted on.The last week of May 1940 was the mostcritical and dramatic of the Second World War.
The full account of British Cabinet deliberationson possible peace negotiations with HitleriteGermany only recently came to light, some so
secret that their record was kept in a special ﬁle.
Churchill’s ‘finest hour’ was to come: Britain
withstood the German Blitz, later that summer
and autumn. Government and people were deter-mined to repel invasion from their shores. InChurchill’s speeches the spirit of resolution and
the will to ﬁght were accurately encapsulated. Yet,
the ‘ﬁnest hour’ might never have struck.The picture of Churchill as the indomitable war leader towering over colleagues is so deeplyetched in the history of the Second World War
that it comes as a surprise that his position as
prime minister during the ﬁrst weeks of ofﬁce 
was far weaker than that enjoyed by any of his predecessors since the fall of Lloyd George.Chamberlain saw Churchill as the best war leader
for the duration of the conﬂict and he was also the
one Conservative whom Labour and Liberals
could agree to serve under. Churchill presided
over a small War Cabinet of ﬁve. Chamberlain andHalifax, the two most powerful Conservatives,were now joined by two Labour Party ministers,
Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood. But
Churchill was regarded with much suspicion by
many Conservatives, who continued to look toChamberlain for guidance. Within the WarCabinet, Chamberlain’s role was still decisive. If
he sided with Halifax against Churchill, given the
continued party loyalty Chamberlain still enjoyed
and the overwhelming strength of the Conserva-
tives in the House of Commons, Churchill wouldnot be able to make his views prevail even with thesupport of Labour and its two representatives in
the War Cabinet. The government might then
break up – as the French did – with disastrous
results at a moment of crisis. This political realityhas to be borne in mind when assessing whatChurchill, Chamberlain, Halifax, Attlee and
Greenwood said during the long hours of Cabinet
discussion in May 1940. What was at stake wasmore than the fate of a government. WhetherBritain would remain in the war, the future ofWestern Europe and the course of world history.Halifax, the foreign secretary, made a deter-mined bid to persuade the War Cabinet to sanc-
tion peace feelers. The Cabinet had authorisedhim on 24 May to try to discover what termsmight keep Mussolini out of the war. But Halifax
went beyond his brief when he spoke to the
Italian ambassador on 25 May. He reported back
to the Cabinet on the morning of Sunday, 26
May, that the Italian ambassador had soundedhim out on whether the British governmentwould agree to a conference; according to the
ambassador, Mussolini’s principal wish was to
secure peace in Europe, and he wanted Italian and
British issues to be looked at as ‘part of a generalEuropean settlement’. Halifax agreed emphati-
cally and replied that peace and security in Europe
were equally Britain’s main object and that ‘we
should naturally be prepared to consider any pro-
posal which might lead to this provided ourliberty and independence were assured’. In thisway efforts to keep Italy out of the war – efforts
that the Cabinet had already sanctioned involved
seeking Roosevelt’s good ofﬁces – were being
widened to draw in Germany and France in an
attempt to reach a general peace. Halifax nowwanted to secure the authorisation of the Cabinetto seek the duce’s mediation for this purpose.
Churchill opposed Halifax; the prime minister’s
instincts were sound. Even if ‘decent’ terms were
offered in May 1940 they would have been nosafeguard against fresh demands later, onceBritain was at Hitler’s mercy. Churchill also knew
that if he consented to the commencement of any
negotiations it might then prove impossible to
ﬁght on. He was therefore determined by any and
all means to block Halifax’s manoeuvres.After the Cabinet meeting on the morning ofSunday 26 May, Churchill lunched with the
French prime minister Paul Reynaud, who had
ﬂown over from France. Churchill urged him to
keep France in the war. Reynaud, according toChurchill, ‘dwelt not obscurely upon the possibleFrench withdrawal from the war’. Reynaud’s
immediate request was that negotiations should
be started to keep Italy out of the war by bribing1GERMANY’S WARS OF CONQUEST IN EUROPE, 1939–41247
Mussolini with offers including the neutralisationof Gibraltar and Suez as well as the demilitarisa-tion of Malta. But Churchill wanted no approach
to Italy. He knew how easily this could slide into
peace negotiations with Germany. He told
Reynaud that Britain would not give up on anyaccount but would rather go down ﬁghting thanbe enslaved to Germany.After further discussions with the French prime minister, the British Cabinet reassembled
in the afternoon. Halifax urged that the media-
tion of Mussolini be sought; Hitler, he observed,might not present such unreasonable terms.Churchill repeatedly opposed such a move. In the
diary Chamberlain kept of these vital hours he
records Churchill as saying:It was incredible that Hitler would consent toany terms that we could accept though if we
could get out of this jam by giving up Malta
and some African colonies he would jump at
it. But the only safe way was to convince Hitlerthat he could not beat us. We might do betterwithout the French than with them if they tied
us to a conference into which we should enter
with our case lost beforehand.What are we to make of Churchill’s remark that‘he would jump’ at the chance of getting out ofthe war? If this one remark is considered out of
context it might appear that not much separated
Churchill from Halifax. But Churchill’s actions
throughout these critical days, and all the argu-ments he marshalled, make it absurd to supposethat he had any other intention but that of defeat-
ing Halifax and of winning over the remaining
Cabinet ministers in order to fight on. An
approach to Mussolini, Churchill warned, would
not only be futile but would involve Britain in‘deadly danger’; ‘let us therefore avoid beingdragged down the slippery slope with France’.Nevertheless, in making an effort to appearreasonable, by apparent concessions to Halifax’s
arguments, Churchill was manoeuvred into a dan-gerous corner at the Cabinet meeting on the fol-lowing day, 27 May. He reiterated his view that
no attempt should be made to start any negotia-
tions by way of Mussolini. Halifax, who was aformidable opponent, now accused Churchill ofinconsistency, saying that when on the previousday he had asked him whether he were satisﬁed
that if matters vital to Britain’s independence
were unaffected he would be prepared to discuss
terms, Churchill had then replied that ‘he wouldbe thankful to get out of our present difﬁcultieson such terms, provided we retained the essen-
tials and the elements of our vital strength, even
at the cost of some cession of territory’. Yet now,
Halifax pointed out, Churchill spoke only of
ﬁghting to a ﬁnish. Churchill was ﬂustered; heattempted to reconcile what could not be recon-ciled by saying, ‘If Herr Hitler were prepared to
make peace on the terms of the restoration of the
German colonies and the overlordship of Central
Europe, that was one thing. But it was quiteunlikely that he would make any such offer.’Halifax immediately followed up his advantage,
pressing Churchill by asking him whether he
would be willing to discuss Hitler’s terms.
Churchill rather feebly responded that: ‘Hewould not join France in asking for terms; but ifhe were told what the terms offered were, he
would be prepared to consider them.’ The
Cabinet ended. Churchill had gained just one
important point: Britain would not initiate direct
negotiations with Hitler.The Cabinet met again on 28 May. Halifaxonce more, on the pretext of starting negotiations
to keep Italy out of the war, was trying to ﬁnd a
way of discussing peace with Hitler’s Germany.
The War Cabinet well understood this. The realdifference between Halifax and Churchill was sim-ple. Halifax believed the war already lost; to ﬁght
on would entail useless sacriﬁce. What he actually
said was that Britain might get better terms before
France left the war and before Britain’s aircraft fac-
tories were bombed by the Luftwaffe. The ItalianEmbassy now wanted to know, Halifax said,whether ‘we should like mediation by Italy’.
Churchill retorted that Britain could not negotiate
from weakness; ‘the position would be entirely
different when Germany had made an unsuccess-ful attempt to invade the country’, he added, andhe argued that even if defeated later Britain would
get no worse terms than now. A nation that went
down ﬁghting would rise again whereas those that248THE SECOND WORLD WAR
tamely surrendered were ﬁnished. Any negotia-tions, furthermore, would undermine the nation’smorale. Churchill was supported by both Attlee
and Greenwood. Halifax contemptuously accused
Churchill of indulging in rhetorical heroics. But
the decisive voice was Chamberlain’s.Chamberlain had been deeply shocked by thedebacle in France. The basis on which he had con-
ducted the war had been shattered. In his diary a
little over a week before these crucial Cabinet dis-
cussions he had noted that he expected a German
ultimatum, and that it might be necessary to ﬁghton but that: ‘We should be ﬁghting only for bet-ter terms not for victory.’ Chamberlain thought
with Halifax that realism could only lead to the
conclusion that the war was lost. But he jibbed at
bribing Mussolini while Britain and Germanyremained at war. On the issue of whetherMussolini’s help should be invoked to bring
Germany, France and Britain to the conference
table his views ﬂuctuated. Halifax worked hard on
him to get him to force Churchill’s hand.Chamberlain, however, attempted to reconcileHalifax and Churchill. In addressing the Cabinet,
Chamberlain said on 28 May:He felt bound to say that he was in agreementwith the Foreign Secretary in taking the viewthat if we thought it was possible that we nowget terms, which, although grievous, would
not threaten our independence, we should be
right to consider such terms.But, he added, he did not think the French ideaof an approach to Mussolini would produce
‘decent terms’, especially with France in Hitler’s
grasp. Chamberlain therefore said he had come to
the conclusion that an ‘approach to Italy was
useless at the present time, it might be that weshould take a different view in a short time, pos-sibly even a week hence’. Churchill had won, at
least for the time being.One cannot say with certainty what wouldhave happened if Chamberlain, not Churchill,had been prime minister. Halifax might then havecarried the day. The impression the documents
leave is that Chamberlain had acted less from con-
viction than out of loyalty to the prime minister.The Cabinet adjourned at 6.15 p.m. Churchillhad called a meeting of the ministers not in theWar Cabinet to his room in the House of
Commons that evening. He told them that ‘of
course whatever happens at Dunkirk, we shall
ﬁght on’. He reported back to the reassembledWar Cabinet at 7 p.m. that his message had beengreeted with enthusiasm. Churchill then agreed
to a long and tactful message to be sent to
Reynaud explaining that Halifax’s ‘formula’ pre-
pared on the occasion of Reynaud’s visit two days
previously, which had contemplated askingMussolini to act as mediator, was now dead; ‘weare convinced that at this moment when Hitler is
ﬂushed with victory ... it would be impossible

for Signor Mussolini to put forward proposals for
a conference with any success’.Churchill’s victory would not be ﬁnal as longas Halifax remained in the Cabinet and could
inﬂuence Chamberlain. Indeed the following day
the foreign secretary challenged Churchill’s 
ﬁghting despatch to Lord Gort. Halifax wanted adespatch sent that left to Gort’s judgement thedecision whether to surrender the BEF. ‘It would
not be dishonourable to relinquish the struggle,
in order to save a handful of men from massacre.’
Churchill was not strong enough to offer outright
opposition to such defeatism but evaded the issueby asking for time to consider the position. Theevacuation from Dunkirk soon made any recon-
sideration unnecessary. Churchill was successfully
playing for time.In mid-June 1940, with the imminent with-drawal of France from the war, there were moreanxious moments for Churchill. In July Hitler in
a speech ﬁnally called on Britain to be reasonable
and to make peace. At the same time he mocked
Churchill, whose position was still far from
assured. On 2 August, the king of Swedensecretly offered his mediation but the Cabinet on7 August approved Halifax’s reply which made
Germany’s withdrawal from all its conquests a
precondition. The full story of continuing
attempts by those under Churchill to seek peaceremains to be told but there is no reason to doubtChamberlain’s continued loyalty to the prime
minister. It enabled Churchill to survive and to
neutralise his opponents.1GERMANY’S WARS OF CONQUEST IN EUROPE, 1939–41249
Chamberlain was incapacitated in the summerof 1940. Inoperable cancer was diagnosed. It wasChamberlain’s terminal illness and resignation
from the government in October 1940 that trans-

formed Churchill’s position. He now became
leader of the party and in November 1940, whenChamberlain died, he paid tribute to Chamber-
lain’s loyalty. During those critical ﬁrst weeks of his

administration he had owed much to him. Britain
had survived. The chiefs of staff in a grave report 
in May 1940 had not rated Britain’s chances very
highly, concluding that ‘Germany has most of thecards; but the real test is whether the morale of ourﬁghting personnel and civil populations will coun-

terbalance the numerical and material advantages
which Germany enjoys. We believe it will.’That Britain had fought back was due to auniﬁed people, to the Royal Air Force, the RoyalNavy and the army, whose morale remained
intact. This unity would have been severely tested
if Churchill’s leadership had been repudiated at
the heart of government. But the doubts and divi-sions within the War Cabinet remained a well-kept secret until long after the war was over. In
December 1940, Churchill reconstructed the War
Cabinet and sent Halifax to Washington as
ambassador, bringing Eden into the Cabinet as
foreign secretary. But we must now retrace oursteps to the course the war took during the lastdays of May and the summer of 1940.On 28 May Leopold, king of the Belgians, capit-ulated, ignoring the contrary advice of his minis-ters. The evacuation of the BEF had begun theprevious day. Every possible boat, including
paddle pleasure steamers, was pressed into service.
The Royal Navy conducted the evacuation, and
some air cover could be provided by the air force.
Göring’s Luftwaffe strafed the boats and the menwaiting on the beaches. But the calm seasfavoured the Allies. The evacuation went on day
after day until 3 June. A total of 338,226 Allied
troops were snatched from certain capture,
including 139,097 Frenchmen, but all the equip-ment was lost. To the south the war went on inFrance, and Britain even sent reinforcements to
encourage the French. But Weygand viewed the
situation as nearly hopeless. The French weregiven a few days’ grace while the German divi-sions redeployed.On 10 June 1940 Mussolini – having con-temptuously rejected Roosevelt’s earlier offer of
good ofﬁces – declared war on an already beaten
France. Even so the French forces along theItalian frontier repulsed the Italian attacks. Butthe Germans could not be held. On 14 June they
entered Paris. The government had fled to
Bordeaux and was seeking release from the British
alliance so that it could negotiate separately with
Germany. Churchill at ﬁrst replied that Britainwould be willing to grant this wish provided thepowerful French ﬂeet were sent to British ports.
Hard on the heels of this response, General de
Gaulle, who had come to Britain to call on the
French to continue the ﬁght from a base still freefrom the enemy, telephoned from London anextraordinary proposal. Britain, as evidence of
solidarity, was now offering to the French an
‘indissoluble union’ of the United Kingdom and
the ‘French Republic’. Churchill had been scep-tical from the ﬁrst about whether this dramaticgesture would have much effect in Bordeaux and
so keep France in the war. Reynaud favoured
acceptance but the French Cabinet never consid-
ered the idea seriously. The ﬁnal agonies ended
with Pétain replacing Reynaud as prime minister.He immediately began armistice negotiations. On22 June the French accepted the German terms
and later signed them in the same railway carriage
in which Marshal Foch had accepted the German
capitulation at the end of the First World War.France was divided into occupied and unoccu-pied areas. The whole Atlantic coast came under
German control. South and south-eastern France
was governed by Pétain from a new capital estab-
lished in Vichy. The colonial empire remained
under the control of Vichy. The French soughtto ensure that their ﬂeet would not be used byGermany against Britain. The armistice provided
that it would be disarmed under German super-
vision. Not unreasonably the British Cabinet
remained unsure whether or not the Germanswould in the end seize the ﬂeet. For Britain thewar had become a ﬁght for survival. In one of 
the most controversial military actions of the 
war, the British navy attacked units of the French250THE SECOND WORLD WAR
ﬂeet at Mers-el-Kebir on 3 July, after the Frenchadmiral refused a British ultimatum requiring himto follow one of four courses, each of which
would have denied the Germans use of these war-
ships. The British action cost the lives of 1,297
French sailors, so recently their allies. It was anindication that Churchill would pursue the warwith all the ruthlessness necessary to defeat a
ruthless enemy. Vichy’s response was to break off
diplomatic relations with Britain.In London, General de Gaulle rallied the smallFree French Forces. But the great majority of theFrench and most of the colonial empire acceptedthe legitimacy of Vichy and Pétain. Vichy France
remained an important strategic factor in Britain’s
calculations, so de Gaulle was not granted the
status of the leader of a French government inexile, even though such Polish, Dutch and Belgiangovernments had been recognised. He deeply
resented this as an insult to the honour of France
as now embodied in his movement.The course of the war from the fall of Franceto December 1941 needs to be followed in threeseparate strands. First there was the actual con-
ﬂict between Britain and Germany and Italy on
land, sea and air. The most critical of the strug-
gles was the battle in the air. Hitler believed that
unless he won command of the air he could not,in the face of the strong British ﬂeet, successfullymount Operation Sea Lion, codename for his
invasion of the British Isles. On 10 July the pre-
liminary of the battle of Britain started over the
Straits of Dover, then in mid-August the mainattack switched to British airﬁelds. The Luftwaffecould use some 2,500 bombers and ﬁghters in the
battle. Britain’s first-line fighter strength was
some 1,200 ﬁghters. The radar stations on the
coast which gave warning of the approach of the
German planes and the cracking of the Germanoperational code, as well as the superiorHurricanes and Spitﬁres, of which 660 could be
used, were to Britain’s advantage. But had the
Germans persisted in their attacks on airﬁelds they
might nevertheless have succeeded in their aim ofdestroying Britain’s air strength. Instead theGerman attack switched to cities. London was
heavily raided on 7 September in reprisal for an
RAF raid on Berlin. On 15 September it was clearthat the German air force had failed to establishcommand of the air and two days later Hitler
abandoned plans for the invasion of England. Butnow the night raids against cities were causingtremendous damage to London and other British
towns. On 14 November 1940 Coventry was
blitzed. The night raids continued, but for all
their damage, for all the loss of life they caused,they were not a decisive factor in the outcome ofthe war. The people emerged from the air-raid
shelters to work in the war factories.More critical was the war at sea. AlthoughBritain controlled the surface of the oceans, sub-marine warfare once again brought it into des-perate danger by disrupting essential supplies
from America. The submarine threat reached its
most serious peak between March and July 1941.
The losses of British tonnage were heavy, but the
US increasingly assumed a belligerent attitude inguarding the convoys on its side of the Atlantic.1GERMANY’S WARS OF CONQUEST IN EUROPE, 1939–41251
1940. A surprise visit. Hitler tours the conqueredcapital © Bettmann/CorbisThe Germans never won what Churchill calledthe battle of the Atlantic.On land Britain at ﬁrst won spectacular victor-ies in Africa during General Wavell’s campaigns
against the Italians in the spring of 1941. With
the help of Dominion troops from South Africa,Australia and New Zealand as well as Indiantroops, a much larger Italian army was defeated
and chased out of Libya and Cyrenaica. In East
Africa Abyssinia was freed and Haile Selassie
restored to his throne. Hitler responded by
sending General Erwin Rommel and an AfrikaKorps to assist the Italians in the western desert.Wavell was forced back to the Egyptian frontier.Britain had weakened her forces in the Middle East by sending an expedition to Greece.
Mussolini had attacked Greece in October 1940to show Hitler that he too could act independ-ently. Unfortunately he could win no battles 
and soon the Greeks were chasing the Italians 
into Albania. In April 1941, Hitler came to
Mussolini’s rescue once more. By the end of themonth the Greeks were defeated and the Britishexpeditionary force withdrew. Britain’s last forces
were defeated in Crete which was spectacularly
captured at the end of May 1941 by German para-
troopers, who, however, suffered heavy casualties
in the operation.The second strand of the period from June1940 to the end of 1941 is formed by the
growing informal alliance between Britain and the
US. During Britain’s ‘finest hour’, it did not
stand alone. Besides the forces of its EuropeanAllies who had formed new fighting units inBritain it enjoyed, from the beginning of the war,
the full support of the Dominions, all of whom
had chosen to stand by Britain. Only Eire
(Ireland) declared its neutrality. The support of
the Dominions and empire was an importantaddition to Britain’s ability to wage war. Butwithout the US Britain’s survival would have been
problematical. Until the fall of France, President
Roosevelt was convinced that to make available
the capacities of American industry to provide warsupplies to Britain and France would be sufﬁcientto ensure an Allied victory. In the mid-1930s
Congress had attempted to prevent the US from
playing a role similar to that of the First WorldWar by passing the Neutrality Laws in 1935,1936 and 1937 so that the US would not be‘dragged’ into war. This legislation denied bel-
ligerents the right to purchase arms and muni-
tions or secure American credit for such purposes.
In November 1939, Roosevelt secured the repealof some of its provisions. Belligerents could now obtain arms and munitions provided they
paid for them and transported them home in their
own ships (‘cash and carry’). Britain and France
took immediate advantage of the opportunity.
Germany, lacking the means to transport pur-
chases to Europe, could not do so.The collapse of American neutrality was rapid.Roosevelt was determined to help Britain in every
way possible to continue the war against Germany
once he became convinced in July 1940 thatBritain was not about to be knocked out of thewar. Congress, concerned to keep the US out of
the war, was the major impediment. Bypassing
Congress, Roosevelt agreed in September 1940 to
Churchill’s repeated pleas for ﬁfty First World Wardestroyers in return for leases on naval bases in theBritish West Indies. He also obtained a formal
promise from the British government never to sur-
render the British ﬂeet to the Germans. But he felt
it politically essential during the presidential elec-
tion of the autumn of 1940 to promise theAmerican people simply, ‘Your boys are not goingto be sent into any foreign wars.’ When the votes
were counted in November, Roosevelt’s victory
was decisive.Following the election, Churchill appealed toRoosevelt for all-out aid. He wanted arms andships and planes if Britain were to match
Germany’s strength. Roosevelt did his best to mar-

shal American public opinion, declaring in a speech
on 30 December 1940 that the US would become
the ‘arsenal of democracy’. The Lend-Lease Act(March 1941) made all these goods available toBritain without payment. By May 1941 Roosevelt
had concluded that the US would have to enter the
war, but given the attitude of Congress and of the
majority of the American people he wantedGermany to ﬁre the ﬁrst shot. Hitler did not
oblige. He cleverly avoided treating the US as a
hostile state even though the US navy was now
convoying merchant vessels – British, American252THE SECOND WORLD WAR
and neutral – halfway across the Atlantic, and wasoccupying Iceland. In August 1941 Roosevelt metChurchill off Newfoundland and they jointly
enunciated the principles on which a post-war
settlement (known as the Atlantic Charter) would
be based after the ﬁnal destruction of the Nazi
tyranny. Roosevelt and Congress supported allsuch non-neutral behaviour partly out of hatred of
Nazi rule but above all because the safety of the US
depended on Britain’s successful resistance.
Roosevelt and Congress had virtually placed the
US in a state of undeclared war against Germany,but did not cross the Rubicon of declared all-outwar until after the attack by Japan in December
1941 – and then it was Germany that ﬁrst declared

war on the US.The third decisive strand of these years was thetransformation of the Nazi–Soviet partnershipinto war which Germany launched against Russia
on 22 June 1941. Since 23 August 1939, when
the Nazi–Soviet Non-Aggression Pact had been
concluded, Stalin had avoided being drawn intowar against Germany. Military unpreparedness in1939 would have made war even more cata-

strophic for Russia then than in 1941: the West
would have remained behind their defensive line
leaving Russia to face the full force of the
Wehrmacht. If the Wehrmacht had succeeded indefeating the Soviet Union, the military pictureof the Second World War would have been totally
different. Stalin in 1939 had no wish, of course,
to save the Western democracies. He wanted to
protect Russia and never lost his belief in theultimate hostility of the Western capitalist powers.From the Soviet point of view the pact with the
Germans had other advantages in enabling Russia
to take on Japan without fear of a German attack
in Europe. The Japanese were stunned by Hitler’s
U-turn of policy. Left isolated, they hastenedtheir own undeclared war with the Soviet Unionon the borders of Manchuria and Mongolia and
were defeated. The Non-Aggression Pact also
brought other gains for Russia. In a secret addi-
tional protocol the Russians secured Germanacknowledgement of the Russian sphere of inter-est in Eastern Europe. The Baltic states, Finland,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, fell into Russia’s
sphere. Russia also expressed its ‘interest’ inBessarabia, then part of Romania. Poland was par-titioned ‘in the event of a territorial and politicalrearrangement’ taking place, a ﬁne circumlocu-
tion for the imminent German attack on Poland.Germany’s unexpectedly rapid defeat of thePoles nevertheless alarmed the Russians, whoextensively mobilised and entered Poland on 17September 1939. But Hitler did not plan to
attack the Soviet Union next. France was to be
defeated ﬁrst. Stalin in any case was conﬁdent that
he could ‘appease’ Hitler. A new Soviet–German
treaty of friendship was concluded on 28September, adjusting the Polish partition infavour of the Germans. The Russians also
denounced France and Britain as responsible for
continuing the war. From the end of September
1939 to June 1941, the Soviet Union suppliedGermany with grain, oil and war materials.In this way the Soviet Union, though ofﬁcially
neutral, became aligned with Germany. The faith-

fulness with which Stalin carried out his part of the
bargain indicates his fear of being exposed toGermany’s demonstrated armed might and heexpected no real help from the West. Fears of
Allied hostility, especially now that the Soviet
Union was collaborating with Germany economic-

ally, were well founded. Until May 1940, when the
German victories in the West revealed the desper-
ate weakness of their own position, the British andFrench were considering not only sending volun-

teers to Finland, but also stopping the ﬂow of oil

from the Baku oilﬁelds by bombing them.
Soviet aggression in 1939 and 1940 was, inpart, pure aggrandisement to recover what hadonce belonged to the Russian Empire and more,
but also to improve Russia’s capacity for defence.
The Baltic states were occupied without a war. But
the Finns refused to accept Soviet proposals for
naval bases and a shift of the frontier on theKarelian isthmus which was only twenty milesfrom Leningrad. In return Finland was offered
Soviet territory. The three-month Soviet–Finnish
War that followed from 30 November 1939 to 12
March 1940 did nothing to enhance Russia’s mil-itary prestige. Hitler noted Finland’s militaryincompetence, but its turn had not yet come, and
Germany did nothing to help the ‘Nordic’ Finnish

undoubtedly severely shaken by Hitler’s victory inFrance, but he did not show it. On the contrary,he was in June 1940 unexpectedly tough, de-
manding that Romania return Bessarabia to Russia
and, for good measure, the province of Bukovina.
He wished to anticipate German dominance in astrategic region bordering on the Soviet Union.Hitler put pressure on Romania to comply. But
secretly he had already made his plans for the
invasion of Russia.Fears in the Kremlin of German dominance inthe Balkans led to a sharp deterioration of goodrelations. This became evident when Molotov, the Soviet foreign minister, visited Berlin in
November 1940. Molotov’s demands infuriated
Hitler and reinforced his determination to ‘smash’
Russia. Yet at the same time Stalin was anxious notto give Germany any pretext for attack and loyallyfulﬁlled to the bitter end all Russia’s economic
undertakings to deliver war materials. When the
Germans struck on 22 June 1941, the Soviet
forces were totally unprepared. Despite all theinformation on the impending German onslaughtreaching Stalin from spies and from the Allies, he
either disbelieved it as an Allied plot to involve the
Soviet Union in war or was afraid to take precau-
tionary military counter-measures for fear of pro-
voking the Germans. His failure in June 1941 wasone of the most extraordinary displays of weaknessby this hard and ruthless dictator.Hitler’s decision to launch his war on Russiamarks the second turning point in the Second
World War; the ﬁrst was Britain ﬁghting on andmade his ultimate defeat certain when he failed todestroy Russia militarily in this new Blitzkriegdur-ing the ﬁrst few months. Previous German military
successes had made him overconﬁdent. The war
with the Soviet Union repeated the ‘war of attri-
tion’ that had brought the First World War to anend. The Russian war from 1941 to 1945 was awar of dramatic movement, unlike the trench war-
fare on the Western front – but its effect in
destroying millions of soldiers and huge quantities
of material, in the end, bled the Third Reich todeath. Why did Hitler attack the Soviet Union?After the fall of France, Hitler hoped Britainwould sue for peace. After the failure of the
Luftwaffe in the battle of Britain, Hitler for thetime being abandoned the alternative of subjugat-
ing the British Isles militarily. He also failed inOctober 1940 to win Franco’s and Pétain’s sup-

port for a joint Mediterranean strategy for destroy-

ing Britain’s Mediterranean power. Hitler now
reasoned that the war against Russia, which he hadall along intended to wage as the centrepiece of hisideological faith and territorial ambition, should be
launched before Britain’s defeat. It was to serve the
additional, though not primary, purpose of con-

vincing Britain that it was useless to continue the
war any longer. Hitler gave the order to prepareOperation Barbarossa on 18 December 1940.A series of brief Balkan campaigns in the springof 1941 ensured that the invasion of Russia would
be undertaken on a broad front without any pos-
sibility of a hostile flank. Fear of Germany,together with hostility to Russia, had turnedRomania, Hungary and Slovakia into more or less
enthusiastic junior German partners who all
declared war on Russia, as did Italy and Finland.
They felt safe under Germany’s military umbrella.Bulgaria, though practically occupied by Germantroops, remained neutral. Hitler thought Yugo-
slavia too was in the bag when the Regent, Prince
Paul, signed a treaty with Germany in March
1941. But there was a revolt against the Regent
and the new government repudiated the Germanalignment. Yugoslavia’s resistance did not lastlong. The Germans attacked on 6 April and the
Hungarians faithlessly joined in three days later.
In less than two weeks Yugoslav resistance was
overpowered. Did the diversion in the Balkans,though minor for Germany, have momentousconsequences by delaying the attack on the Soviet
Union – a delay that meant the Wehrmacht
ground to a halt in front of Moscow in the bitter
winter of 1941–2? The campaign was too slight
to affect signiﬁcantly the time it took to assemblethe huge build-up of men, equipment and sup-plies for the Russian invasion. In the early hours
of 22 June 1941 the Germans launched the attack
with approximately 190 German and satellite divi-
sions. The Soviet Union had no choice but toenter into an alliance with Britain and, later, intoalignment with the US as well. The consequences
of this new war unleashed by Hitler proved
momentous for the course of world history.254THE SECOND WORLD WAR
The Paciﬁc War grew out of Japan’s China Warrenewed in 1937. It was essentially the future of
China that four years later led Japan to war withthe US. The decision for war was taken in Tokyoin September 1941 because the US was seen 
as the enemy unalterably opposed to Japan’sconcept of its right to a dominant role in Chinaand eastern Asia. The only chance for peace was
a change in the course of American policy as per-
ceived by the Japanese, and this did not happen.The Japanese leaders believed that the choicebefore them was to fulﬁl the task of conquest or
to acquiesce in Japan’s national decline.But the course of events that led to war wasnot so straightforward when looked at in depth,and raises fascinating questions. Was the Japanese
perception of US policy correct? Britain and theUS, moreover, were not the only two strongWestern powers with interests in eastern Asia.
From the beginning of Japan’s expansion in
China, the only country capable of challengingJapan’s army on land, with an army of millions,other than Nationalist China, was Russia. At the
time, in the mid-1930s, the Japanese militaryasked themselves whether Japan’s empire couldever be completely safe without ﬁrst removing the
potential Russian threat. Should therefore a war
against its northern neighbour precede the effortsto control China? Indeed, might an alliance withChina against the Soviet Union be possible? And
if the Soviet Union was to be fought, or checkedfrom interfering in Japan’s China policy, thenmight not Europe help?Such a view corresponded with the traditionsof Japanese foreign policy. From 1902 until its
dissolution at the Washington Conference twodecades later, Japan had enjoyed the support ofthe Anglo-Japanese alliance. In the new condi-
tions of the 1930s, Hitler’s Germany was theobvious counterweight to Bolshevik Russia. Thehistory of German–Japanese relations from 1936,
when Japan ﬁrst joined the Anti-Comintern Pact,
to the close of the Second World War is anotherimportant theme.The roots of the conﬂict lie in the militaristic-spiritual values that Japanese education incul-

cated. During the 1930s these values weretranslated into politics by the small group of mil-itary, naval and political leaders who exercised
power. They now controlled a highly centralisedbureaucratic state, having reversed the earlierbroadening of political participation which had
taken place during the so-called era of Taisho
‘democracy’ of the 1920s. Men like PrinceKonoe, prime minister in 1937–9 and 1940–1,believed that Japan had a right to achieve equal-
ity with other great powers. Unlike the US andthe British Empire, Japan lacked the necessaryresources within its own tightly packed islands to
fulﬁl the role of a great power. It was a have-not
nation, so some Japanese argued, claiming onlythe opportunity for prosperity and strength towhich its advanced culture, civilisation and capac-
ity for modern technical development entitled it.For Konoe’s foreign minister, Matsuoko, Japan’sinternational conduct was also a question of
1Chapter 23THE CHINA WAR AND THE ORIGINS OF
THE PACIFIC WAR, 1937–41
national pride. No Japanese must accept theinsulting, inferior role the Western imperialistsassigned to them. Only by showing forceful
courage would the West ever be convinced of theequality of Japan. The view of many Americanpoliticians was precisely the counterpart of this;
the Japanese would give way if shown a ﬁrm hand.While Western Realpolitikwas certainly prac-tised by Japanese policy makers, the ultimatefactor deciding national policy was not rational
policy but chauvinism masquerading as spiritualvalues. The chief of the Japanese naval generalstaff, for instance, urged in 1941 that Japan
should wage war to remain true to the spirit of
national defence, saying, ‘even if we might notwin the war, this noble spirit of defending thefatherland will be perpetuated and our posterity
will rise again and again’. The ‘spirit’ of war itselfwas gloriﬁed; a nation that denied this spirit anddid not rise against injustice would deserve to
decay. The ‘injustice’ referred to was America’s
denial that Japan had the sole right to shapeChina’s destiny. All this chauvinistic spiritualitywas not the inevitable heritage of Japanese beliefs.
There were opposing views, socialist, paciﬁc viewsbased on different Japanese traditions.Britain and the US formally protested atJapanese aggression in China, but there was no
thought in the 1930s of resisting it by force solong as only China was involved. Japan, more-over, stressed the anti-communist aspect of its
policy when concluding the Anti-Comintern Pactwith Germany in November 1936. The followingsummer of 1937 was decisive in the policies
pursued by the Kwantung and Manchurian
armies. In June Russia’s capability to hinderJapanese objectives in China was tested. Therewas more sporadic ﬁghting on the borders with
Russia in 1938. The fighting capacity of theSoviet Union had recovered sufficiently fromStalin’s purges of the armed forces to inﬂict a
severe defeat on the Japanese army at Nomonhan
in August 1939. More than 18,000 Japanese werekilled. This evidence of Soviet strength, comingclose on the heels of the German–Soviet Non-
Aggression Pact, led the Japanese to revise theirestimate that Russia was too weak to interfere inChina. The Soviet Union became an important
factor in Japan’s calculations. Meanwhile the diein China had long been cast, but the Japanesearmy, despite its victorious advances, could notbring the China War to an end.The Japanese army had continued to interfereand expand its inﬂuence in northern China from
1933 to 1937, but in the whole of northern China
the Japanese garrison was only 6,000 men. Then,
near Peking, on an ancient bridge, Chinese andJapanese soldiers clashed in July 1937. The MarcoPolo Bridge incident was in itself minor; exactly
how a small number of Japanese and Chinesetroops came to clash is still obscure. There is noevidence (unlike in Manchuria in 1931) that the
Japanese army had planned war against China and
provoked the conﬂict. There were divided counselsin Tokyo. The hawks won. At ﬁrst, sharp local
actions were undertaken in the expectation that
Nationalist China would be overawed. Full-scalewar ensued when Chiang Kai-shek chose to resistinstead. The war quickly spread from northern
China. The Japanese attacked Shanghai and by
December 1937 the Nationalist capital of Nankinghad fallen. Japanese reinforcements had beenrushed to China. In the Shanghai–Nanking opera-

tion the Japanese suffered 70,000 casualties andthe Chinese at least 370,000. By then 700,000Japanese troops were engaged in China. After
1938 close to 1 million Japanese troops were ﬁght-

ing some 3 million Chinese troops. The Japanesetroops behaved with the utmost brutality, mas-
sacring, raping and looting. The ‘rape of Nanking’
leaving 20,000 Chinese civilians dead, became abyword for barbarity, shocking the West. It wasnot the end of the war, as the Japanese hoped, but
its beginning. The China War became a three-
sided struggle between the Chinese Communists,the Chinese Nationalists and the Japanese. TheCommunists’ main priority was to gain control
over as much of the territories evacuated by theNationalists as they could. The Nationalist Chinesearmies bore the brunt of the regular ﬁghting.
The sinking of the US naval vessel, Panay, anddamage to the British Ladybirdin December1937 directly involved the two Western powers in
the conﬂict. Since the autumn of 1937 Roosevelthad been searching for some effective counterblastto German, Italian and now Japanese aggression.
He gave expression to his desire for ‘positive

Japan’s war in Asia, 1937–45endeavours to preserve peace’ in his well-known‘Quarantine’ speech in Chicago on 5 October1937. He called on the peace-loving nations to
make a ‘concerted effort’ in opposition to the law-less aggressors; that lawlessness, he declared, wasspreading and the aggressors, like sick patients,
should be placed in ‘quarantine’. It was rousing
stuff but meant little in concrete terms. Thedepression preoccupied the US and Britain athome. Neither Congress in America nor Parlia-
ment in Britain would contemplate war withJapan. After the Panayincident, and before fullJapanese apologies were received, Roosevelt for a
short while had considered economic sanctions.
What destabilised relations further was a renewednaval race between Japan and the US.Meanwhile, the powers with interests in Chinahad met in Brussels but the conference assembledthere could achieve nothing. Britain would not actwithout US backing, or in advance of American
policy. The needs of the Dominions, Australia and
New Zealand, for adequate protection or peace in the Paciﬁc were obvious. Britain could notmatch the worldwide defence requirements of 
its Commonwealth with its available militaryresources, which had been neglected for years. Asthe crisis mounted in Europe the British navy was
needed in home waters and the Mediterranean
and could not be spared for Singapore. Althoughrecognising clearly the threat Japan posed toBritish interests in China and Asia, a cautious pol-
icy had to be followed: conciliation and ﬁrmnesswithout risking war at a time of European dan-gers. In 1939 the Japanese blockaded the British
concession in Tientsin, demanding that Britain in
effect abandon Nationalist China. It was a seriouscrisis but the simultaneous threat of war in Europedecided the British Cabinet in June 1939 to reach
a compromise with Japan.The ﬁrst tentative shift of American policy,nevertheless, did occur just after Britain’s climb-
down in the summer of 1939. Of fundamental
importance for the history of eastern Asia was thatfor a decade the US felt uncritically anti-Japanesewhile Chiang Kai-shek became an American folk
hero.The prime minister, Prince Fumimaro Konoe,would have liked to bring the war in China to anend but his ‘solution’ implied Chinese acceptanceof Japan as the senior member of the Asian‘family’. That is how the Japanese deluded them-selves that their aggression was really for the good
of all the Asian people. The vastness of Chinese
territory denied the Japanese army the possibility
of conquering the whole of China, even aftereight years of warfare. Within the huge areas theydid occupy, despite the utmost barbarity of the
occupation, which would have been unthinkable
in the Meiji era, much of the countryside remain-
ed under Communist or Nationalist control. The
Japanese for the most part could make their occu-pation effective only in the towns and along thevital railway lines.Encouraged by moral and some materialAmerican support, Chiang Kai-shek refused all
peace terms that would have subjugated China inthe manner of Japan’s Twenty-One Demands. InNovember 1938 Konoe sought to make it clear to
Chiang Kai-shek, and the world, that Japan would
never leave China. Japan would establish a New
Order in Asia through the economic, political andcultural union of Japan, Manchukuo and China.The new order served notice to the Western 
powers that there would be no room for Western
interests of the kind that had existed in China
before. Early in 1939 Konoe resigned. It is cer-
tainly mistaken to see him as a peaceful moderate,though he endeavoured to avoid war with the USwithout abandoning Japan’s anti-Western policy
in east Asia. German victories in Europe from
September 1939 to July 1940 greatly strength-
ened the impatient military. With the abolition ofpolitical parties Japan became more authoritarian.In July 1940 Konoe headed a second govern-ment. Japan drew closer to Germany, concluding,
as a result of Foreign Minister Matsuoka’s urging,
the Three-Power Pact (Italy was also a signatory)
on 27 September 1940. It purported to be anagreement on the division of the world. Japanrecognised Germany’s and Italy’s leadership in the
establishment of a ‘new order in Europe’;
Germany and Italy recognised the ‘leadership of
Japan in the establishment of a new order inGreater Asia’. With the reservation of Japaneseneutrality towards the Soviet Union, the three
powers promised to help each other by all means,
including military, if attacked by a ‘Power at pre-258THE SECOND WORLD WAR
sent not involved in the European War or in theSino-Japanese Conflict’. That article (three)pointed to the US. What was the purpose of the
alliance? Both the Japanese and the Germans at
the time hoped it would act as a deterrent against
the US involving itself in a war over Asian issues.Hitler, furthermore, hoped Japan would attackSingapore, thus increasing the pressure on Britain
to make peace with Germany or to face even worse
military complications in defence of its empire. In
Tokyo, in all probability without Berlin having
any knowledge of it, the German ambassador in an additional exchange of notes with Matsuokaconceded to the Japanese a good deal of ﬂexibility
in the honouring of their obligations to help
Germany militarily if, in fact, the US went to war
with Germany alone and not with Japan.The existence of the treaty made a deep impres-sion on Roosevelt, who saw it as conﬁrmation that
all the aggressors in Europe and Asia were linked
in one world conspiracy of aggression. Roosevelt
discovered that this was not, in fact, so when theJapanese–American confrontation had reached thepoint in September 1941 at which war was seen by
the Japanese as the only way out. But the prime
cause of US–Japanese tension was not the
German–Japanese alliance. That lacked all sub-
stance on the Japanese side. Konoe instructed theJapanese Embassy in Washington in September1941 to tell the US that if it went to war with
Germany in Europe, Japan would not feel itself
bound to declare war on the US in the Paciﬁc but
that the ‘execution of the Tripartite Pact shall beindependently decided’.The account of how the US and Japan cameto be engaged in the Paciﬁc War is a twisted and
tangled one. Roosevelt did not want a war in the
Paciﬁc, believing that the defeat of Nazi Germany
should take priority. Hitler urged the Japanese tostrike at the British Empire in Asia, thereby weak-ening Britain’s capacity to oppose him in Europe
and the Mediterranean. If the Japanese decided
they had to attack the US simultaneously, they
were assured of Germany’s alliance. What theJapanese wanted was to ﬁnish the war in China,not to have to take on America as well.In Britain both Chamberlain before May 1940and Churchill afterwards wished to avoid theextension of war in the Paciﬁc. In 1940 and 1941Britain was engaged in fighting in the Medi-
terranean and the Middle East to preserve its
power there. The Dominions of New Zealand and
Australia, moreover, clamoured for adequate
defence in eastern Asia; that defence would bestbe served by peace and deterrence. But Churchillbelieved that for deterrence to have credibility the
US and Britain would need to form a counterpart
to the Triple Alliance of Japan, Germany and Italy,
so that Japan would realise that its expansion
beyond the limits which Britain and the US wereprepared to accept in south-east Asia would resultin war. Thus both Churchill’s and Roosevelt’s
thinking was based on the theory of deterrence.The mutual policies of deterrence – of theJapanese on the one hand, and of the US andBritain on the other – failed. The US was notdeterred by Japan’s alliance with Germany and
Italy from continuing to play a role as an eastern
Asian power. Indeed, it stepped up its support for
Chiang Kai-shek. Without Nationalist Chineseresistance,the ever-growing pretensions of Japan’s
co-prosperity sphere would become a reality,
placing Western interests completely at Japan’s
mercy. For Britain, the vital regions were those
bordering on the British Empire in Malaya,
Burma and India. In this way the French coloniesof Indo-China, the Dutch East Indies, independ-ent Thailand and the American Philippines came
to be seen as the key areas to be defended against
Japan. But the ‘ﬁrm’ policy towards Japan even-
tually adopted by the US to impede Japaneseexpansion triggered off among Japan’s leaders analmost fatalistic response that war with the US
and Britain was preferable to the kind of peace, a
return to the Washington peace structure of the
1920s, which the two Western powers sought.
The crux was China. Britain and the US were notprepared to accept Japanese domination overChina. Roosevelt held to the simple truth that
China was for the Chinese. Furthermore, if the
Japanese were allowed to achieve their aims in
China no Western interests in eastern Asia wouldbe safe.The course of US policy from 1940 to 1941was nevertheless not clear or consistent. It is
sometimes difﬁcult to fathom precisely what was1THE CHINA WAR AND THE ORIGINS OF THE PACIFIC WAR, 1937–41259
in Roosevelt’s mind. He was sensitive toAmerican public opinion, which increasinglydemanded tough measures, short of war, to
restrain Japan from ousting US commerce fromChina. Yet, with war raging across the Atlantic,Roosevelt genuinely wished to preserve peace in
the Paciﬁc for as long as possible, though not on
Japan’s terms. The US possessed powerful retal-iatory economic weapons: the American marketfor Japanese goods, American raw materials essen-
tial to Japan, including oil, and capital forJapanese industry. Secretary of State Cordell Hulladvised caution in applying any economic sanc-
tions; but some of Roosevelt’s other advisers,
including the powerful secretary of the treasury,Henry Morgenthau, believed that Japan wouldhave to accept American conditions for a just
settlement in China once the US made use of itseconomic muscle, for oil and raw materials wereessential to sustain a Japanese war against the
West. Roosevelt followed an uncertain middle
course. In July 1939, the Japanese were informedthat the treaty of commerce with the US wouldbe terminated in January 1940. This was the ﬁrst
tentative application of economic pressure andshocked the Japanese leaders. After its termina-tion it would be possible to impose sanctions
other than ‘moral embargoes’.With the defeat of the Netherlands and Franceby Germany in the summer of 1940, the chancesof peace in the Pacific grew less. French and
Dutch possessions in south-east Asia now becametempting targets for Japan, which cast covetouseyes particularly on the Dutch East Indies with
their valuable raw materials of tin, rubber and 
oil. But the American administration made clearthat it would regard any change in the status quoof these European possessions as endangering
American interests and peace in the Paciﬁc. In1940 Japan increased the pressure on France andBritain to block aid to China. Vichy France had
to accept the stationing of Japanese troops in
northern Indo-China and for a time Britainagreed to close the Burma Road along which sup-plies had been sent to Nationalist China. If the
US were not prepared to use its economicweapons, then, the British argued, there wasnothing left for them to do but to attempt to
appease Japan.In July 1940, Roosevelt took a second step toapply economic pressure on Japan. He orderedthat the export of petrol suitable for aviation fuel
be restricted, in addition to lubricants and high-
grade scrap metal. Although this was intended as a
limited embargo, there were those in Washingtonwho, rightly as it turned out, foretold that turningthe screw would not make for peace but would
lead the Japanese in desperation to attack the
Dutch East Indies. Roosevelt was well aware of 
the danger and characteristically wanted to apply
some pressure but not push Japan too hard. TheTripartite Pact, which Japan, Germany and Italy concluded in September 1940, hardened
Roosevelt’s attitude. In a speech soon after the
conclusion of the pact, Roosevelt declared: ‘No
combination of dictator countries of Europe andAsia will stop the help we are giving to ... those
who resist aggression, and who now hold the
aggressors far from our shores.’ All the same, from
the summer of 1940 to the summer of 1941
Roosevelt attempted to dampen down the crisis inthe Pacific. He gave some additional help toChina, but also urged restraint on Japan. He also
made it clear that he was still willing and anxious to
negotiate a settlement. Meanwhile he rejected
Churchill’s urging that the US and Britain should
jointly take steps so that the Japanese should be left in no doubt that further aggression in Asiameant war.Negotiations got under way in Washingtonbetween the Japanese ambassador Nomura and
Secretary of State Cordell Hull in the spring of1941. Meanwhile, the Japanese signed a neutral-ity pact with the Soviet Union and were extend-
ing their military bases to southern Indo-China in
the obvious direction of the Dutch East Indies. 
A crucial decision was taken in Tokyo that
affected the whole course of world history. Theplan to strike north from China and join Germanyin the war against the Soviet Union was rejected.
Japan would advance to the south to secure the
raw materials vital to its own needs. An imperial
conference on 2 July 1941 gave its seal ofapproval to that decision. The goal was the DutchEast Indies. Japan did not wish to go to war with
the US and the British Empire. Its diplomats
would try to convince London and Washington260THE SECOND WORLD WAR
that for Japan this was a question of survival. IfBritain and the US, however, opposed the south-ern drive, the Japanese Empire would not shrink
from war either.Roosevelt proposed that, if Japan withdrewfrom southern French Indo-China, the raw mater-
ials it needed could be guaranteed by the powersand the region would be neutralised. What
impressed the Japanese more was the order freez-

ing Japanese funds in the US and an American
trade embargo which, despite Roosevelt’s initial
intentions, included oil. But Roosevelt’s objectwas still to avoid war in the Paciﬁc, while somehow
getting the US in on the side of Britain in Europe.
After the German invasion of Russia during the
summer of 1941, he also ordered that ways be
found to provide all-out aid to the Soviet Union.So when in mid-August 1941 Nomura sug-
gested the continuation of informal negotiations
to settle American–Japanese differences, Roosevelt
agreed. Nomura suggested a meeting between
Prime Minister Konoe and the American presi-
dent. Roosevelt was excited by the idea, but fol-
lowed the advice of the State Department and
insisted that ﬁrst the Japanese government should
accept a number of basic propositions: they should
desist from a southern drive of conquest (that is,
in the direction of the Dutch East Indies), theyshould agree to withdraw troops from China andto give up any economic discrimination, and they
should detach themselves from the Tripartite Pact.
All but one of these preconditions were entirely
unacceptable to the Japanese. They might havebeen willing to halt their southern expansion ontheir own terms, but not to make any but token
withdrawals from China.What the Americans were really demandingwas the Japanese abandonment of the basic tenets
of their co-prosperity sphere. The negotiationsdragged on through October and November.The gulf between the Japanese and American
concepts of the future peace of eastern Asia was
as wide as ever, despite the search by the diplo-
mats for some middle ground. As late as mid-November 1941, Roosevelt was searchingwithout success for a compromise that would lead
to a postponement of war for at least six months.
This shows that for Roosevelt, in any case,Germany still came first, but his judgementsproved very changeable.In Tokyo the basic countdown to war wasdecided upon at the Imperial Conference which
took place on 6 September 1941. Prime Minister
Konoe opened the meeting saying that Japanmust complete its war preparations, but thatdiplomacy should be given a last chance to resolve
peacefully the problems facing it. If diplomacy
failed, and only a limited time could be allowed
for its success, then Japan must ﬁght a war of self-
defence. The US’s conditions for a settlement,involving not only a barrier to the southern driveof Japan but also American insistence that Japan
withdraw its troops from China and abandon its
demands for exclusive economic control, were,
Konoe claimed, tantamount to denying Japan’sright to exist as an equal and Asian power.Without oil and a certain source of essential raw
materials Japan was at the mercy of foreign
powers. That was Japan’s interpretation of the
American proposals for a peaceful settlement. The chief of naval staff, Admiral Nagumo Osami,moreover, was conﬁdent that the Japanese navy’s
early victories would place Japan in an ‘invincible
position’ even in a long war. The Japanese army
chief of staff urged the opening of hostilities as
soon as possible while Japan still enjoyed a rela-tive military advantage. The tone of the confer-ence was therefore that war with the US and
Britain would become inevitable unless American
policy rapidly altered course. In October, Konoe
resigned and made way for a new governmentheaded by General Hideki Tojo, a clear indicationthat the moment for war was drawing close.The outcome of these Tokyo conferencesbecame known in Washington from the inter-
cepted instructions cabled from Tokyo to Ambas-
sador Nomura, who was still negotiating withCordell Hull in Washington. The Japanese codehad been broken by the Americans, who were now
privy to the Japanese secrets. They thus learnt that
the Japanese had a time limit in mind for the
success of these negotiations. Furthermore, thatthere could be no question of any genuineJapanese withdrawal from China and that when
the time limit expired the Japanese army and navy
would extend the war by continuing their drive1THE CHINA WAR AND THE ORIGINS OF THE PACIFIC WAR, 1937–41261
southward against the Dutch and British posses-sions. What was not clear was whether theJapanese intended to attack the US simultaneously
in the Paciﬁc. The Americans, therefore, were

aware while negotiating that unless they were pre-
pared to abandon China war would becomeinevitable. The Japanese might be brought tocompromise on their ‘southern’ drive in return for
American neutrality but not on the issue of the
war in China. The Hull–Nomura negotiations
were thus unreal, maintained on the American
side mainly in the hope of delaying the outbreakof war. It is in this light that Roosevelt’s remarksat a policy conference that took place on 25
November must be judged. Roosevelt by this time
regarded war as virtually inevitable, observing:
‘The question now was how we should manoeu-vre them into the position of ﬁring the ﬁrst shotwithout allowing too much danger to ourselves.’
But the well-known Hull Note of the follow-
ing day, sent in reply to an earlier Japanese 
note, was couched in the form of a ‘tentative out-line’ to serve as a ‘basis for agreement’. It set outAmerica’s ideas for a settlement point by point.
The Japanese could look forward to a normalisa-
tion of trade and access to raw materials in return
for peace in eastern Asia; the Japanese must
promise to respect the territorial integrity of all itsneighbours; the ‘impossible’ American conditionfrom the Japanese point of view was that both
Japan and the US should give up their special
rights in China and that Japan should withdraw all
its military forces from China and Indo-China.At the Imperial Conference in Tokyo on 1December 1941, this note was placed before the
assembled Japanese leaders as if it were an ulti-
matum. It was a deliberate misrepresentation by
the Japanese themselves, intended to unite the
ministers. Differences were now, indeed, recon-ciled. The decision was reached to attack Britain,the Netherlands and the US simultaneously.The Japanese sent a formal declaration of warto Washington, intending it to be delivered ﬁfty
minutes before the carrier planes of AdmiralYamamoto’s task force, which was at thatmoment secretly making for Pearl Harbor,
attacked America’s principal naval base in the
Paciﬁc. Unfortunately, the Japanese Embassy wasslow in decyphering the message and so theJapanese envoys appeared at the State Depart-ment almost an hour after the start of the Pearl
Harbor attack on the US fleet. That made 7
December 1941 an unintentional, even greater
‘day of infamy’.Japan had decided to start the war havingclearly set a time limit for negotiations in
September. It was self-deception to believe that
the US was about to make war on Japan after
Hull’s note on 26 September, even if Roosevelt
thought war virtually inevitable. There is no evi-dence that Congress would have allowed the president to declare war for the sake of China or
of any non-American possessions in Asia attacked
by the Japanese. The traumatic loss of lives and
ships, the fact and manner of the Japanese attack,now ensured a united American response for war.For Churchill a great cloud had lifted. With the
US in the war, he knew that Hitler would now
be defeated. Furthermore, the US found herself
simultaneously at war with Germany, not by res-olution of Congress, which might still have beendifﬁcult to secure, but by Hitler’s decision to
declare war on America. In this way it came about
that in December 1941 all the great powers of
the world were at war.It was Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, commander-in-chief of the Japanese navy, whohad planned the daring pre-emptive strike on Pearl
Harbor. The actual task force was commanded by
Vice-Admiral Nagumo Chuichi. The Japanese
warships reached a position 275 miles north ofPearl Harbor, escaping detection; Nagumoordered the carrier planes, two waves of bombers
and ﬁghters, into action and they hit Pearl Harbor
on a Sunday morning. The naval base was unpre-

pared. Six battleships were sunk and the remaining
two damaged; many planes were destroyed on theground; 2,403 servicemen and civilians were killed.The unexpected position of the Japanese task
force, and lack of proper service cooperation in
Washington were responsible for the disaster. That
Roosevelt and Churchill wanted it to happenbelongs to the legend of conspiracy theories. TheUS Paciﬁc ﬂeet was only temporarily crippled; of
the eight battleships six were repaired and saw
action again.262THE SECOND WORLD WAR
The Second World War was the last world war tobe fought with conventional weapons and the ﬁrst

to end with the use of the nuclear bomb, which
raised the threat that any third world war could endin the destruction of the majority of the humanpopulation. The Second World War also became a
new kind of total warfare with the deliberate killing
of many millions of civilian non-combatants.The major technical advance was aerial warfare.That cities could be reduced to rubble from theair was first demonstrated by the Germans inSpain in 1937 with the destruction of Guernica.
In 1939 it was the turn of Warsaw, and in 1940
of Rotterdam and Coventry. Britain and the US
from 1942 to 1945 retaliated with mass bombingof the majority of Germany’s cities, with heavycasualties to civilian populations and widespread
destruction. The Allied bombing of Dresden,
crammed with refugees from the east, just before
the war ended has been singled out for particular
condemnation. By February 1945 the devastationof German cities no longer affected the outcomeof the war. The Germans fought on in despera-
tion. There seemed to be no alternative. Fear,
especially of Russian revenge, maintained the
resistance. Nor did the devastation prevent therapid expansion of war production in Germany.Was the great loss of human life justiﬁed by the
military results? Post-war official Germany
estimates that 593,000 civilians were killed.Vengeance on the Allied side was a subsidiarymotive for the bombing offensive. The lives ofmore than 50,000 aircrew and an enormousindustrial war effort would not have been
expended for mere vengeance. Photographic
reconnaissance of the destruction of the industrialRuhr region and other cities seemed at the timeto justify these raids as crippling blows against
Germany’s capacity to wage war. There can be 
no doubt that German resources were destroyed
and wasted in reconstruction and that this weak-
ened Germany’s war effort. But more specificstrategic bombing of, for instance, synthetic fuelplants and communications was more effective
and did severely impede the German war effort
from 1944 to 1945. The brilliant German arma-
ments minister, Albert Speer, could no longermake good the losses within the shrinking Reich.Furthermore, before the invasion of France in
1944 the land war waged by the Allies was minor
relative to the struggle on the eastern front. The
bombing offensive was the only major weapon
available to wage a war whose impact would befelt by the Germans until the Allied military build-up was sufﬁcient to defeat the German armies in
the west.During the Second World War the distinctionbetween combatants and non-combatants was notso much blurred as deliberately ignored. Thefactory worker was seen as a combatant. In most
contemporary eyes, as the war progressed, this
justiﬁed their destruction and the destruction of
their home from the air. Children, women, theold and the sick were killed and maimed in this1Chapter 24THE ORDEAL OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR
new type of warfare. The Germans, Japanese andItalians went beyond even what, in the SecondWorld War, came to be considered legitimate
warfare against all those involved in the war effort.
What would have been in store for Europe, Asia
and Africa if Germany and Japan had won the warcan be seen from their ruthlessly brutal behaviouras occupying powers. The contrast with the First
World War in this respect could not be greater.
Murder and terror became deliberate acts of
policy.Hitler’s Reich was no respecter of the humanvalues of those regarded as belonging to lesserraces, or of the lives of the Germans themselves.
The ‘euthanasia’ programme, for example, was
designed to murder ‘useless’ incurably ill or men-
tally handicapped German men, women and chil-dren. Many thousands of gypsies, classified as‘non-Aryans’, were murdered in Auschwitz.
Jehovah’s Witnesses, whose faith would not allow
them to be subservient to Hitler’s commands,
were persecuted and killed, as were countlessother civilians of every nationality who weredeﬁned as opponents of the ideals of the regime.
Hostages were picked off the streets in the occu-
pied countries and shot in arbitrary multiples for
the resistance’s killing of German soldiers.
Offences against the occupying powers were pun-ishable by death at the discretion of the local mil-itary authorities. To hide partisans or Jews meant
the death penalty if discovered or denounced. For
the Jews in Europe, who were not so much oppo-
nents as defenceless victims, a unique fateawaited: physical destruction, as foretold inHitler’s Reichstag speech of 30 January 1939.Yet, side by side with these horrors, theGerman armies ﬁghting the Allied armies in the
west behaved conventionally too and took pris-
oners who were, with some notable exceptions,treated reasonably. In Russia, however, theGerman army became increasingly involved with
the specially formed units attached to the army
commands, which committed atrocities on a huge
scale. Here, there was to be no ‘honourably’ con-ducted warfare.More than 3 million Russian prisoners of war inGerman hands died through exposure and famine.
Himmler, who as head of the SS organisationwielded ever-increasing power, later in the warrecognised the waste of manpower involved, andRussian prisoners of war and civilians were used as
forced labour in German war industries. Many
died from exhaustion. On the Allied side, some
300,000 German prisoners of war in Russianhands never returned to Germany. There was alsothe Soviet murder of Polish ofﬁcers at Katyn, their
bodies discovered by the Germans in mass graves
in April 1943. The full horror of this slaughter 
was only revealed by Russia’s new leaders in
September 1992. The orders to shoot Polish ofﬁ-cers and civilians in prison for suspected enmity tothe Soviet Union were signed in March 1940 by
Stalin himself and by three Politburo comrades,
Voroshilov, Molotov and Mikoyan, at the sugges-
tion of Beria, chief of the secret police. In the for-est of Katyn, near Smolensk, 4,421 Polish ofﬁcerswere shot. They were only a proportion of the
total victims. Another 17,436 soldiers and civilians
were murdered as well. All the Soviet leaders,
Khrushchev, Brezhnev and Gorbachev, were toldof the dark secret in the ﬁles, which were kept in aspecial safe. Brezhnev minuted, ‘Never to be
opened’; Gorbachev passed on some information
to the Polish government. The Yeltsin govern-
ment revealed the full account of the murders.Japanese troops also became brutalised. To betaken prisoner was regarded as a disgrace. Alliedprisoners of war were treated inhumanely by the
Japanese military authorities, and thousands of
them died. Many were employed together with
forced Asian labour on such projects as the con-struction of the Burma–Siam railway. By the timethat death line was completed in October 1943,
100,000 Asians and 16,000 Europeans had lost
their lives. In China, the Japanese slaughtered
civilians – tens of thousands.The horrors and ordeals, the depravity andbrutality behind the battlefronts, the mass murderof millions are an inseparable part of the history
of the Second World War. The atrocities cannot
be set aside by the misguided argument that those
on one side cancel out those on the other.In Poland, and then in Russia, the Germanconquerors displayed a degree of barbarism that
has no parallels with Germany’s conduct during
the First World War. In the 1930s, for tactical rea-264THE SECOND WORLD WAR
sons, Hitler had been prepared to work with thePoles, and his view of them was quite favourable.The authoritarian Polish state, the Polish brand 
of anti-Semitism and official Poland’s anti-
Bolshevism made them, in Hitler’s eyes, suitable
junior partners. But Poland’s courageous resis-tance in 1939 changed all that. With the exceptionof the Jews, who were all seen as destroyers of the
Aryan race, Hitler’s views of what to do with other
‘races’ such as Slavs was opportunistic. He cared
nothing for their lives. In destroying the Polish
intelligentsia he was not so much following a racialpolicy as taking what he regarded as the most efﬁ-cacious practical steps to root out the strong sense
of Polish nationalism. The same ‘racial’ inconsis-
tency is noticeable in the treatment of the
Ukrainian population. Vengeance for the slightestresistance to his will was a dominant element ofHitler’s character. Parts of western Poland were
annexed by Germany and settled with ‘German’
farmers, mainly the so-called Volksdeutsche, ethnicGermans who for generations had lived in EasternEurope.The greater part of the rest of Poland wasorganised as a colony called the General
Government of the Occupied Polish Territories
headed by Hans Frank, a fanatical, brutal Nazi
since the earliest days of the party. In this colonythe Poles were to rise to positions no higher thanworkers. Frank described his ﬁef in November
1940 as ‘a gigantic labour camp in which every-
thing that signiﬁes power and independence rests
in the hands of the Germans’. Frank, himself, typ-ically for the strife-torn Nazi German administra-tion, engaged in much inﬁghting with the SS,
who obeyed no one except Heinrich Himmler.
The Ukraine, with Frank’s General Government,
was selected by the SS for the majority of the sites
of the extermination camps, such as Treblinka.Frank approved of the murder of the Jews, objecting to their settlement in the General
Government. In December 1941 he declared:
‘Gentlemen, I must ask you to arm yourselves
against all feelings of pity. We must destroy theJews wherever we meet them wherever possible.’The majority of the Polish people wouldsurvive so long as they served their German
masters and lost all national consciousness. Whatthe Nazis had in store for the Jews was so incred-ible that, even when the facts leaked out, most ofthe Jews still surviving in German-occupied
Europe could not believe it, nor was the horror
fully grasped abroad. Indeed, the hell the Nazis
created in the death camps of the east, like hellitself, is so far removed from human experienceas to be scarcely real and credible. The Holocaust
forms one of the most difﬁcult aspects of modern
history to explain and understand.Hitler, in conditions of peace, that is before theoutbreak of war in 1939, could not order themass murder of German, Austrian and Czech
Jews within Germany. If the German sphere was
to be made judenrein, free of Jews, their forcedemigration was the only option. For Hitler, theJews had another possible value; they could beused to blackmail the West. He believed National
Socialist propaganda that behind the scenes the
Jews were influential in pulling the strings of
policy in Washington, London and Paris. His aimwas to conquer continental Europe piecemeal.The next target was Poland. In January 1939 he
therefore threatened in his well-known Reichstag
speech that the Jews would perish if Britain,
France and the US resisted his aggression on the
continent by unleashing a general war.Until Germany attacked the Soviet Union inJune 1941, there seemed to be a small chance of
a Western peace. Jews in Germany and conquered
Europe were still allowed to live. Hitler liked to
keep options open: alternative solutions to isolatethe Jews and drive them out of Europe altogetherwere considered, such as the plan to banish them
to Madagascar. That from the start he had no
moral inhibition against mass murder, if that
should prove the best course, cannot be doubted.
During the summer and autumn of 1941, mil-lions of ‘Bolshevik’ Jews, the mortal enemy in hiseyes, were added to the millions of European
Jews already under German control, and mass
emigration or expulsion overseas was no longer a
possibility. Nor, with so much non-Jewish slavelabour falling into German hands, Hitler calcu-lated, would Jewish slave labour be needed. The
option of mass murder as the ﬁnal solution now
became the most desired and practical course.1THE ORDEAL OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR265
As Hitler’s own pep talks to the generals dur-ing the spring of 1941 show, on the eve of theattack on Russia, the ‘racial’ war was now being
openly launched. That spelt doom for the Jews,
the race that Hitler saw as a pestilence in human
society. He could now repeat his Reichstag speechof January 1939, this time as a justiﬁcation to theGerman people for the destruction of Jewry. In
the light of this analysis Nazi policies followed a
path that had, inevitably, to end in genocide.By every means available, the Nazis attemptedbefore 1939 to ‘clear’ Germany of Jews by forcingthem to emigrate. The Germans were not alonein following such policies. The Poles, too, before
the war hoped to ‘solve’ their Jewish problem by
promoting forced emigration of the Polish Jews.
Anti-Semitism was virulent all over Europe and inthe US. But discrimination was not a part of gov-ernment policy in any Western country, offend-
ing as it does against basic civil rights and
freedoms. Entry of Jews to settle outside
Germany was restricted. Unemployment was higheverywhere so any increase of labour was not welcomed, especially if caused by immigrants
deprived of their money and possessions. Western
governments were preoccupied with their own
problems during the depression years. And it
always has to be remembered that before 1942no government in the West could conceive what‘Final Solution’ lay in store for the Jews on the
German-dominated continent.Britain, holding the League Mandate forPalestine and having promised the Jews a NationalHome there had a special responsibility to aid theJews. Until German persecution became more
severe, the majority of German Jews, however, did
not wish to emigrate to Palestine. When they des-
perately sought to leave Germany after November
1938 and would have gladly escaped to Palestine,the British government was more concerned tosafeguard its vital strategic interests in the Middle
East. Palestine had become a cauldron of conﬂict
between Arabs and Jews and the British occupiers.
In Arab eyes both the Jews and the British author-ities were European colonisers of Arab lands. TheArabs, moreover, could see that the increased
Jewish immigration had its roots in European
anti-Semitism, which strengthened Zionism.British governments tried to extricate themselvesfrom these conﬂicting interests without satisfyingeither the Zionists or the Arabs. Finally, in May
1939 the British government took the decision
that the Arabs would have to be appeased by
promising to limit Jewish immigration to 75,000over the next ﬁve years and, after that, the gov-ernment promised the Arabs that further immi-
gration would be subject to the consent of the
Arab majority.Public opinion and voluntary organisationsbefore 1939 gave the efforts to rescue the Jews adynamism that governments lacked. Germany’sEuropean neighbours, and the US and Latin
America, accepted German and Austrian Jews in
tens of thousands. Although the Nazis were ready
at ﬁrst to expedite their exit even after the warbroke out, the exodus was slowed down to a trickleby the war. In all, more than half the German Jews,
some 280,000, succeeded in finding refuge
between 1933 and 1939, many, however, only
temporarily as Hitler overran the continent. TheJews so saved came from Germany and from thecountries – Austria and Czechoslovakia – occupied
by Hitler before the outbreak of war in 1939. They
represented only a very small proportion of
Europe’s total Jewish population.In Poland in 1940 many Polish Jews werekilled wantonly, and the whole Jewish populationwas herded into ghettos, as in the Middle Ages,
by fencing off or building a wall around a part of
a city and leaving the Jews to fend for themselves.
The two largest were in Warsaw and Lodz. In theghettos the Germans could secure what was prac-tically slave labour to supply the German armies.
Undernourished and overcrowded, the ghetto
population was decimated by disease and exhaus-
tion. The planned massacre designed to kill every
last Jew was begun on the day, 22 June 1941,when the German armies invaded the SovietUnion. These terrible killings of men, women and
children in Russia, machine-gunned next to the
open graves they had been forced to dig, had
been deliberately worked out beforehand. Hitler’sfull brutality is revealed by the record of a FührerConference held at his headquarters on 16 July
1941 in which he spoke of his aims and referred
to Russian orders to start partisan warfare behind266THE SECOND WORLD WAR
the German front. Hitler saw in this order ‘someadvantages for us; it enables us to exterminateeveryone who opposes us’. The actual task for the
open-air killings was assigned to special SS
detachments, the Einsatzgruppen. The Germanarmy and special police units recruited inGermany, too, became heavily implicated in themass murder. Nazi ideology had come to be
widely accepted by ordinary people. Hitler and a
small leadership group could not have committed
such crimes without thousands of active helpers
and an uncaring attitude to the victims by manymore even where it was not actually hostile. The‘Final Solution’ in the Soviet Union avoided all
need for transport and special camps or ghettos.In Poland, the Jews were not perishing fastenough. Then the destruction had to be plannedof the Jews remaining in German-occupiedEurope, and of the Jews living in the countries of
Germany’s allies. After discussions among the
Nazi leaders an order to Heydrich, a subordinate
of Himmler, was issued by Göring on 31 July1941 to draw up plans for the destruction of non-Russian Jewry on a systematic basis. In accor-dance with these instructions Heydrich called thenotorious conference on 20 January 1942 ofsenior administrators from the various Reich min-
istries who would be involved and which took its
name from Wannsee, a favourite picnic area just
outside Berlin, where they met. It was assumedthat the Jews in the rest of Europe could not bemassacred as in Russia. Though there were several
concentration camps in Germany itself, these
could kill only tens of thousands, not millions!
The greatest concentration of Jews was already in
Poland, so to Poland and the east the Jews wereto be transported: ‘Europe will be combed fromwest to east.’ What ‘resettlement’ really meant
was clear from the record of the conference:the Jews capable of work will be led into theseareas in large labour columns to build roads,whereby doubtless a large part will fall away
through natural reduction ... The inevitable

remainder will have to be dealt with appropri-
ately, since it represents a natural selectionwhich upon liberation is to be regarded as agerm cell of a new Jewish development.1THE ORDEAL OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR267
Survivors of the Warsaw ghetto rising are marched to their deaths, 1943. © National Archives, WashingtonNo one present could doubt that what wasbeing planned was, indeed, mass murder. AdolfEichmann of the SS, who was present and was one
of the principal organisers of the Holocaust, later
testiﬁed that the atmosphere was one of general
agreement; no one raised difficulties or moralobjections. The eastern ghettos now became tran-
sit stations as the plans were implemented. The
construction of the Auschwitz extermination camp
had already begun before the Wannsee Confer-

ence. Others followed, among them Chelmno,
Belzec, Sobibór, Treblinka. These camps of massmurder were speciﬁcally equipped to kill thousands
every day, generally in large gas chambers. The‘selection’ of those to be murdered as unﬁt to work

was done on arrival from the rail transports arriving
straight at the camps; the remainder, a smallernumber and never the old, the sick or children,were allowed to survive some weeks longer. There
were very few long-term survivors.Mass murder was so huge in extent that his-torians cannot tell for certain even to the nearestmillion how many people perished. Despite thevirtual hopelessness of their situation in some
ghettos and camps, a few Jews did resist, and with
such weapons as could be smuggled in fought
against German troops, thus at least selling their
lives dearly. The whole world learnt of the Jewishrising of the Warsaw ghetto in April and May1943 and its destruction. Less well known were
risings in a number of extermination camps, in
Treblinka in August 1943 and Sobibór in
October of the same year, for instance. A fewthousand more Jews were able to escape into theforests in Poland and the Ukraine, and operated
as partisan units. They were not always welcome,
and they were sometimes killed by their compa-
triots as well as by the Germans. Before the war
was over, between 5 and 6 million Jews had beenmurdered. Nazi ideology was so widespread thatit is unrealistic to limit responsibility for these
crimes to Hitler and his henchmen. While
Germans, soldiers, the SS and ofﬁcials were over-
whelmingly responsible, they were aided in theirwork of destruction by some sections of the con-quered peoples of Europe in every country.In Germany knowledge was widespread,brought home by soldiers and SS on leave fromthe east. How much the Germans were actuallytold can be seen from an article written byGoebbels and published in the ‘respectable’
weekly journal Das Reichon 16 November 1941.That world Jewry started the war, he wrote, was
proven beyond dispute:The Jews wanted their war, and now they haveit. What is now coming true is the Führer’s
prophecy of 30 January 1939, in his speech to
the Reichstag, when he said that if inter-

national Finance Jewry once more succeededin driving the peoples into a world war, theresult would not be the bolshevising of the
world and thereby the victory of the Jews, but
the destruction of the Jewish race in Europe.
We are now witnessing the fulﬁlment of thatprophecy, and a destiny is being realised whichis harsh but more than deserved. Feelings of
sympathy or pity are entirely inappropriate ...

[Jewry] according to its law, ‘an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth’, is now perishing.The demand of the German authorities that allJews be handed over for the terrible Final
Solution being prepared for them was one of the
deepest moral challenges faced by occupied
Europe and Germany’s allies during the SecondWorld War. There was not one response that wasuniquely French, Polish, Dutch or Hungarian.
The response was multi-faceted. There was the
‘ofﬁcial’ collaboration of governments – and even
this was not uniform – and then there was theresponse of institutions, the churches above all,and of ordinary people. In every corner of Europe
there were some individuals who risked their lives
to shelter Jews. The Jews who survived in
Germany were mainly those in mixed Jewish–
Christian marriages. They, too, were on the listfor incarceration, possibly murder but they camelast in the plan for the ‘Final Solution’ and the
war was over before they could be dealt with.
Several hundred Jews were hidden from human-
itarian motives or managed with forged papers topass themselves off as Aryan. The Christians whoprotected Jews in Germany were heroic, their
number pitifully small – far fewer than in Poland
or other occupied countries. In Germany the268THE SECOND WORLD WAR
opportunities for the non-privileged Jews (thosenot married to Christian spouses with offspring)to survive were so slight as to be negligible in
practice.Poles and Jews had lived for centuries together,but in separate communities. Even in 1931, mostof the 3 million Jews in Poland were largely unas-similated, although those who were assimilated
were well represented in the professions and the
middle class. Under the Nazi occupation anti-
Semitism was reinforced by propaganda, but there
were Poles who, though they did not like Jews,helped them because they hated the Germansmore. There were also Poles who actively assisted
the Germans to round up Jews. Several thousand
Poles, however, out of feelings of pity, hid Jews at
great risk to themselves, for the penalty was death.It has been estimated that between 50,000 and100,000 Polish Jews survived, some ﬁghting as
partisans or with the Red Army. In Warsaw
15,000 found hiding places, many more than in
Berlin. Had more Germans made efforts to protestat the persecution of the Jews, Hitler would havefound it far more difficult to carry out the
Holocaust.In the Netherlands, Belgium, France and,above all, Italy the Jews stood a better chance of
survival. Many Jews were hidden in homes, inmonasteries and in villages. Ofﬁcial Vichy France,
however, gave some aid to the Germans in round-

ing up the Jews, including French citizens of
Jewish faith, for transportation to the death camps
in the east. Uniquely, all but 500 of about 7,000Jews living in Denmark were rescued by theDanish resistance by being ferried across to
Sweden. The Danish resistance had been alerted to
their imminent deportation by Dr Duckwitz, a
courageous German ofﬁcial in Copenhagen who

had learnt of their intended fate from a leak passedon by someone in the Gestapo. The fate of theDanish Jews who did not escape was extraordinary.
The Nazi rulers in Berlin maintained the ﬁction

that Denmark had remained a sovereign country
and the Danes were therefore permitted to con-
tinue to protect all Danish citizens, includingDanish Jews. The 500 Danish Jews were deported
to the privileged ghetto of Theresienstadt, where
they were housed separately in much better condi-
tions than the other Jews. They remained in con-
tact with the Danish authorities, who insisted onproviding for them to the end of the war. None
were transported to the extermination camps fur-

ther east and almost all of them survived and
returned to Denmark after the liberation. Theywere the fortunate exception. Dr Duckwitz alsosurvived and is honoured as ‘one of the righteous’
at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial in
Jerusalem.Germany’s ally, Italy, on the other hand, inpractice protected Jews despite Mussolini’s anti-Jewish legislation. Until Italy’s capitulation andthe consequent German occupation, the Italian
military authorities in their Croatian zone and in
the Italian zone of France prevented both
German troops and police from arresting Jews fortransportation east or murder by the CroatianUstachi on the spot. The Italian army would have
nothing to do with the brutal mass murder of the
Jews being instigated by the Germans and their
‘allies’ and either sabotaged orders or simplyrefused to carry them out. Feelings of humanityand decency were not extinct.In occupied Europe local police could befound to do the dirty work of the Germans for
them. In some cases they would have been shot
had they disobeyed. In others the work was donewith enthusiasm. The public silence of the Popeand the Vatican and of the GermanProtestantchurches signiﬁes a massive moral failure. In con-
trast, in Holland Catholic churches and many
Protestant churches read protests from the pulpitafter the ﬁrst Dutch transport of Jews. Priests andpastors, wherever Germany held power, suffered
martyrdom for their personal protest. Bishop
Galen of Münster publicly condemned the
murder of some 60,000 to 80,000 feeble-minded
and incurably ill Germans in the so-called‘euthanasia’ programme but failed to raise hisvoice for the Jews. Hitler feared that the people’s
war effort might be undermined by an open
onslaught on religious beliefs. A strong public
movement by the Germanchurches and military,might have saved countless Jewish lives. Hitlerand his regime were sensitive to, and watched, the
reactions of the German people. There was no
such public movement.1THE ORDEAL OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR269
The importance and nature of resistance to the Nazis within Germany itself and in Nazi-
dominated Europe varied enormously. Conspira-
torial by necessity, it came into the open in acts ofviolent sabotage and several attempts on Hitler’slife, the most spectacular – the 20 July 1944 plot
– almost succeeding when an explosive charge
went off a few feet from Hitler at his headquarters
in East Prussia. The composition of the resistance
ranged from members of the pre-Nazi Weimarpolitical parties to individuals moved by moralconsiderations. Thus in Munich a small group of
students and teachers who called themselves the
White Rose distributed, until they were caught
and executed, thousands of leaﬂets condemningthe barbarities of the Nazis. But the only resis-tance that had the power actually to remove Hitler
came from within the army and culminated in the
bomb plot of 20 July 1944. The ofﬁcers involved
saw clearly that the war was lost and hoped by
removing Hitler to be able to make peace with theWestern allies while keeping the Russians out ofGermany. Others were less materialistically moti-
vated. Had Hitler been killed, the plot might have
succeeded, though Britain and America wouldcertainly have refused to make peace on any termsother than unconditional surrender.Successful armed resistance, tying down con-siderable numbers of German troops, was carriedout by Tito’s partisans in Yugoslavia. And inFrance, while Pétain and the Vichy regime
enjoyed overwhelming support, a sizeable minor-
ity joined the French resistance, undertaking 
sabotage and supplying a ‘secret army’ which
returned aircrew shot down in France andBelgium on an escape route back to England byway of neutral Spain. In the east, Russian partisans
acted as auxiliaries of the Red Army and inter-
rupted the supply routes of the Wehrmacht. But in
occupied Europe there was not one simple strug-gle against Nazi Germany. Among the resistanceﬁghters themselves there was conﬂict after the
communists joined the resistance after Hitler’s
invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.The struggle in Yugoslavia between the royal-ist Colonel Mihailovic and the communist leader,Tito, led to civil war between them as well as waragainst the Germans. In Poland, the Home Army
was as bitterly opposed to the Polish communist
partisans as to the common German enemy. Here270THE SECOND WORLD WAR

Stalin had the last word. The Polish governmentin exile in London, and the Home Army, whichtook its orders from London, attempted to frus-
trate or at least impede Stalin’s plans to bring
Poland under communist control. In August
1944, as the Red Army reached the River Vistula,the Home Army began to rise in Warsaw againstthe Germans. Their intention was to prove to the
world that Poles, not the Russians, had liberated
the Polish capital. The Poles seized half the city
and fought bitterly for two months until their
capitulation to the Germans on 2 October.Warsaw was entirely destroyed. Soviet help wascynically withheld by Stalin. Only during the last
stages were Russian supplies dropped; they could
only prolong the doomed struggle, resulting in
the deaths of still more Polish Home Army ﬁght-ers holding out in the sewers of the city. TheSoviet command had even prevented Polish units
ﬁghting with the Red Army from battling their
way to the city. Soviet airﬁelds were closed to
relief ﬂights from the West. Surrender terms werefinally agreed by the Home Army with theGermans on 2 October 1944 and three days later
General Bor-Komorowski, with the exhausted
remnants of the ﬁghters, gave up the struggle.
Surprisingly the Home Army were well treated as
prisoners of war, probably in order to increasehatred between the Poles and the Russians.During the early stages of the rising auxiliarySS units committed terrible atrocities against the
civilian population, until regulars were brought in
to crush resistance. The total (mainly civilian)casualties in Warsaw reached about 200,000. TheGermans lost some 2,000 killed and 9,000
wounded. Polish military casualties were far
higher: 17,000 killed or missing and 9,000
wounded. Politically and militarily the anti-
communist Polish underground had been de-stroyed, leaving a vacuum which Stalin was ableto ﬁll with communists ready to follow Soviet
orders. The Warsaw rising marked one more mile-
stone in the tragedy of Poland and signalled to
the rest of the world the ruthlessness of whichStalin was capable in furtherance of the SovietUnion’s post-war plans.In the West this conﬂict between the commu-nist and anti-communist resistance did not ﬂareinto civil war but a similar pattern emerges. As thedefeat of Nazi Germany drew close, the resistancewas as concerned with questions of post-war
political power as with ﬁghting the Germans. The
Nazi answer to all resistance from whatever
quarter was terror.Houses were burnt to the ground in reprisalsand people not involved in the resistance were
killed wholesale. The destruction of the village of
Oradour-sur-Glane in France and of Lidice in
Czechoslovakia, and the massacres that took place
there, are among the best known of such barbar-ities. But these were just two of the thousands ofatrocities that became a common occurrence in
German-occupied Europe. The terrible reprisals
taken by the German occupiers raise the question
whether the Allies should have actively encour-aged resistance and parachuted agents into theoccupied countries, many of whom lost their
lives. All over Europe, from northern Italy to
Norway, large German forces were tied down.
The Nazi new order could not be imposed any-where unchallenged, and the German forcescould not relax their vigilance amid populations
of which signiﬁcant sections were hostile. Even
though the active resistance was a minority, it
made an impact out of proportion to its numbers.The Japanese had been at war since 1937. Theysought to justify their wars of expansion at home
and abroad both as self-defence and as fulﬁlling a
mission of liberating Asia from Western imperial-
ism. In its place Japan would build a Greater EastAsia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Japanese, toemphasise the solidarity of eastern Asia against the
West, chose to call the war they had launched the
Greater East Asian War. The real intentions of the
Japanese leaders can be deduced from the deci-
sions taken at secret conferences in Tokyo ratherthan from the rhetoric of their propaganda. Firstconsideration in all the conquered regions was to
be given to military needs. Local economies were
to be strictly controlled and independence move-
ments discouraged. No industry was to be devel-oped in the southern region, which was tobecome the empire’s source of raw materials and
a market for its goods. The Japanese saw them-
selves as the superior people who possessed the1THE ORDEAL OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR271

Everywhere propaganda and indoctrina-tion sought to reinforce the superiority of every-
thing Japanese. For the indigenous peoples, for-
eign Western rule was replaced by more brutal
foreign Japanese rule. To compete with America’sresources the Japanese mercilessly extorted allthey could from the occupied lands.Even before the war had been launched asecret conference in Tokyo on 20 November
1941 settled the general principle of Japanese
occupations. Local administrations were to beutilised as far as possible, but each territory wasplaced under military government and subordi-
nated to Japan’s needs. The Japanese government
never worked out any really coherent plan for the
future of eastern Asia. Some territories of partic-ular strategic importance, such as Malaya, wouldremain under direct Japanese control; others, the
Philippines and Burma, were promised eventual
‘independence’ but only if they became coopera-
tive satellite states. Japanese attempts to win overthe mass of Asian peoples to support the waragainst their former colonial masters were almost
totally a failure. The great majority of the ordi-
nary people did not see the conﬂict as their war.
Equally, there was little active support for the
departed Westerners against the Japanese, exceptin the Philippines. In Burma, and especially in thePhilippines, sections of the population became
vehemently anti-Japanese. But on the whole the
peoples saw themselves as suffering from a war
between two foreign masters struggling for ulti-mate control over them. In India, as has beenseen, the political leaders sought to make use of
the situation to promote genuine independence.Of all the peoples under Japanese rule, theChinese suffered the most – both in China and
wherever Chinese communities had settled insouth-eastern Asia. In Singapore after its fall,there was a terrible bloodbath of Chinese and at
least 5,000 were massacred. Japanese barbarities
against the Chinese population, which consti-

tuted about a third of the total population ofMalaya, drove them into armed resistance.Japanese terror tactics thus proved counter-
productive. With the Japanese as masters instead
of the Europeans, local administrations continuedto function, with the indigenous junior adminis-trators carrying out the orders of their newmasters. With the need to fight the war, the
Japanese left the social order intact and tried to
preserve the status quo. To win over the popula-
tion and channel nationalist feelings, they set upJapanese-controlled mass movements. The con-stant emphasis on Japanese superiority, however,
alienated the local populations.Some nationalist leaders, because of their pop-ularity, such as Sukarno in Indonesia, were able
to gain a degree of genuine independence inreturn for promising to rally the people to coop-erate with the Japanese war effort. More conces-
sions were promised to the Burmese and Filipinos
in 1943 as the war began to go badly for the
Japanese. In August 1943 Burma was proclaimedindependent, but in alliance with Japan and at warwith the Allies. In October the Japanese spon-
sored an independent Philippine republic and in
the same month Bose proclaimed a provisional
Indian government in exile. In mainland Chinapuppet governments had been set up from thefirst; Manchuria had been transformed into
Manchukuo in 1932 with its own emperor, 
Pu-yi; another Japanese-controlled government
of China was set up in Nanking in 1938. But
plunder, rape and massacre were routinely perpe-trated by the Japanese troops in China. Despite a veneer of local autonomy in some regions 
under Japanese occupation, the reality of the co-
prosperity sphere was not liberation but Japanese
domination and imperial exploitation.In 1942 the Japanese had won large territoriesin Asia at small cost. The Americans prepared
their counter-offensive across the Paciﬁc, straight
at the Japanese heartland. This is how Japan was
defeated while its armies still occupied the greater
part of what had been conquered at the outset ofthe war. The fall of the Japanese-held island ofSaipan, in July 1944, placed American bombers
within range of Tokyo. The Americans hoped to
bomb the Japanese into submission. The massive
raids brought huge destruction on the ﬂimsilyconstructed Japanese houses. On 10 March 1945one of the most devastating air raids of the whole
war was launched against Tokyo. The ﬁre storm
created destroyed close on half the city and1THE ORDEAL OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR273
caused 125,000 casualties. In May and June 1945the bomber offensive spread to sixty other majortowns throughout Japan.On 6 August 1945, for the ﬁrst time, a newweapon was used, the atom bomb that devastated
Hiroshima. The destruction and suffering wereappalling. Most of the city was destroyed, 66,000people were killed in an instant and even more
succumbed to a new man-made illness, radiation
sickness. For decades the atom bomb claimed
victims from among the survivors. The casualties
from the spring raid on Tokyo by ﬂeets of Super-Flying Fortresses were greater, but what ﬁlled theworld with awe and horror was that a single plane
dropping just one bomb from out of the blue sky
could produce such suffering and destruction. A
second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki threedays later, again causing great loss of life. In theface of such a war the Japanese surrendered.The Second World War was waged simultane-ously in Asia, Europe and North Africa by hugearmed forces on all sides, backed by tanks and air-craft in numbers hitherto unknown and, in itsclosing stages, with a new weapon releasing the
devastating power of nuclear ﬁssion. The destruc-
tion and maiming on a global scale exceeded any-
thing known before. The war caused not onlymany millions of dead and wounded, but alsoinflicted on millions more forcible population
migrations and wholesale destruction of towns
and villages – a sum total of virtually unimagin-
able human misery.As the tide of the war turned, the German peopleincreasingly suffered the ravages of war. The losses
on the eastern front alone matched the bloodbath
of the First World War on all fronts. The great
majority of the German war dead died ﬁghting inRussia. The bomber commands of the Alliesinﬂicted devastation as city after city was laid to
waste during the last months of the war. Above all
else, the German people feared the Russians, bent
on revenge. Ethnic Germans and German colonis-ers fled from the advancing Russian armies,retreating into Germany. The Sudeten Germans,
who had lived in Czechoslovakia before 1938,
were driven out. Most of the Germans living in
Polish-occupied eastern German regions from
East Prussia to Silesia – assigned to the Poles foradministration in compensation for territoriallosses to the Soviet Union – were driven out or
fled in terror from the Poles and Russians.
‘Orderly and humane’ population transfers were
sanctioned by the Allied Potsdam Conference inthe summer of 1945. But the mass exodus of 15million people immediately after the war was cer-
tainly not orderly and was frequently inhumane.
Pent-up hatreds against the Germans burst out
and were vented not only on the guilty supporters
of Hitler’s regime but also, indiscriminately, ontens of thousands of innocent people, on childrenand the sick. The exodus from Eastern and central
Europe began during the last months of the war
and continued after the war was over. Although
relatively few were deliberately murdered, in all asmany as 2 million Germans are estimated to havedied as a result of the privations they suffered.Mere statistics cannot convey the tragediesthat befell almost every family in Europe. The274THE SECOND WORLD WAR
9 August 1945. The mushroom cloud over Nagasakiobscured the death and devastation below. ©
National Archives, WashingtonSoviet Union suffered the most: at least 28 mil-lion military and civilian people died – a stagger-
ing ﬁgure. Germany’s dead numbered between4.5 and 5 million. Proportionately to their pop-ulation, the Jews suffered the most; only a minor-ity of those in Europe at the outbreak of the 
war survived to its end. For Britain, France and
Italy, however, the Second World War casu-
alties did not repeat the bloodbath of the FirstWorld War. British military and civilian deathstotalled 450,000, to which must be added those
of the empire: 120,000. The French ﬁgures are
approximately 450,000 dead; the Italians lost
410,000 dead. Yugoslav, Hungarian, Polish and
Romanian losses were heavy. In central Europe,the Poles suffered far more even than their neigh-bours. American deaths on the European and
Paciﬁc fronts numbered 290,000. No one knows
how many million Chinese died in the war; the
ﬁgure may well be in excess of 10 million; about2 million Japanese are estimated to have lost theirlives in the war. The physical destruction has
largely been made good in the years since the war.
But the loss of lives will continue to be mourned
as long as the generations that experienced thewar are still alive. The ordeal of the Second WorldWar also serves as a lasting warning to future gen-
erations of what national aggression, evil leaders
and the intolerance of peoples can lead to.1THE ORDEAL OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR275
Lucky those who were killed outright. A new disease‘radiation sickness’ meant a lingering painful death.
© National Archives, WashingtonThe war that began in September 1939 was aEuropean war, in contrast to the world war that
ensued when the Soviet Union, the US and Japan
became involved in 1941. Militarily there is anobvious reason for seeing 1941 as a dividing line.In Asia, the China War being waged since 1937
was a separate conﬂict until it was widened into
the Paciﬁc War by Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor.
In Europe Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union
marks a turning point in the course of the war.But in a deeper sense the global implications ofHitler’s attack on Poland in 1939 were there from
the beginning. Long before Germany declared
war on the US, America was throwing its support
behind Britain and actually engaging in warfare in the battle of the Atlantic. Then Nazi–Soviet‘friendship’, affirmed in August 1939, was
nothing but a temporary expedient. Hitler did
not abandon his goal of winning living-space in
the east and conquering ‘Jewish-Bolshevism’.In 1940 and 1941 Britain on its own was inca-pable of inﬂicting serious damage on Germany.Was its survival as a belligerent therefore of much
importance? Without the war in the east, it is dif-
ﬁcult to imagine how Britain could have launched
even a destructive bomber offensive againstGermany. Not only was much of the German airforce fighting the Russians, but had the war
against Russia not continued, and so frustrated his
plans, Hitler would have diminished the size of
his victorious continental army and transferredthe main German war effort to building up an airforce which, in sheer size alone, would have over-whelmed the Royal Air Force. Hitler was never
able to realise this plan as Germany’s war
resources continued to be fully stretched inholding the eastern front. Britain was the onlyWestern European democracy left in 1940. Its
refusal to accept the apparent logic of the military
situation saved post-war Western Europe from
suffering the fate either of continued German
overlordship or of a future under Stalin’s RedArmy if, as seems more probable, the SovietUnion had won the war. Instead democratic
Britain provided the link, and later the base, for
an Anglo-American counter-offensive in Western
Europe that created the conditions for recoveryfree from the totalitarian control of the left or theright. Without Britain still ﬁghting from 1940 to
1941, the likelihood of an American involvement
in the European theatre of the war was remote.The powers victorious in the Second WorldWar recognised that they would be faced withworld problems and worldwide confrontationsafter the war was over. The future of the millions
who were largely tacit observers of the war, the
subjects of the colonial European empires, or
under Japanese rule, would be dependent on itsoutcome. A new world was in the making and itshistory would have been different had Germany
and Japan emerged as the post-war superpowers.The size and destructive capability of thearmies that fought on each side during the SecondWorld War exceeded even those of the Great WarChapter 25THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5
of 1914–18. Behind the ﬁghting fronts, the indus-trial war was waged, pouring out guns, tanks, air-craft and ships. One of the most intriguing aspects
of the war was that of spies and of science. Despite
spectacular coups, the achievement of the spies 
in affecting the course of the war was less thanmight have been expected. The success of espi-onage and counter-espionage meant that they
tended to cancel each other out. One of the best-
known illustrations of this was the failure of
Richard Sorge, the master spy working for the
Russians in Tokyo, to convince Moscow that hisinformation from the German Embassy of Hitler’sintentions and the timing of the invasion of 
the Soviet Union was true. On the Allied side
demonstrable vital espionage success, was the
breaking of the German code machine Enigma,used by Germany’s armed forces. The Poles hadbuilt a replica and just before the start of the 
war passed its secret to the British, who contin-
ued the decyphering work at Bletchley Park. The
intelligence data, codenamed ‘Ultra’, thus helpedBritain and its allies in the air war, in theMediterranean and in the North African cam-

paigns, but most crucially in the battle of the
Atlantic.The Allies derived huge advantage from theirsuccessful application of science to warfare. Radarwas in use early in the war in both Germany andBritain; Germany was probably ahead in its devel-
opment at the outset of the war. But during
1940–1 small airborne radar sets were produced
in Britain which allowed night ﬁghters to defendcities during the Blitz. Airborne radar also becamean indispensable adjunct to the Allied bomber
offensive, enabling the bombers to pinpoint their
targets at night. At sea, advanced types of radar
gave the Allies a decisive advantage against
German submarines in the spring of 1943 andhelped to turn the tide of battle in their favour.But the scientiﬁc breakthrough that did mostto shape the future was the atomic bomb; the
decision at the end of the war to use this weapon
brought about the rapid Japanese surrender.Allied scientists from many nations, British,American, French, Danish, Italian and German
too (for German refugees played a crucial role),
made the construction of a nuclear bomb possi-ble. It was eventually in the US that science wasmatched by the technical know-how and the pro-duction facilities necessary for its manufacture
were provided. First tested in the empty spaces of
the New Mexican desert, the bomb was dropped
just three weeks later in August 1945 overHiroshima.An early indication of Allied suspicions aboutthe likely post-war attitude of the Soviet Union
can be seen in the decision not to share the secrets
of nuclear development with the USSR. Indeed,
despite an agreement with Britain, the US soughtto retain a monopoly on the manufacture of theseawesome weapons. The Soviets were well aware
they would need to develop their own atomic
bomb and in 1942, despite the immediate
German threat, pressed ahead vigorously withtheir own research. The Danish atomic scientistNiels Bohr advised Roosevelt that the Russians
would succeed in building their own bomb some
time after the Americans did so. Would it not be
better to share secrets with them and to work forinternational control? The Russians made theirown bomb in 1949. The atom spy Klaus Fuchs
had provided some help but the Russians could
eventually have built their own bomb in any case.
It seems unlikely that the course of Stalin’s policy
would have differed much even if the Americanshad passed on the atomic secrets. German atomicresearch – despite the eminence of some of the
scientists ready to work for the Nazis – lagged
behind. Hitler, according to the armaments min-
ister Albert Speer, was not prepared to earmarkthe vast resources necessary to make the bomb,regarding nuclear physics as ‘Jewish physics’.
Instead, the Germans did devote great resources
to the development of new rockets, which by
themselves could have no decisive effect on 
the war. The outcome was the pilotless plane, the V-1, and the advanced supersonic rocket, the V-2, against which there was no defence when 
it came into use in 1944.In the summer of 1940 it was difﬁcult to see howGermany’s victorious armies would ever bedefeated. But by attacking the Soviet Union in
June 1941 and then declaring war that December
on the US the balance potentially swung against1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5277
Germany. Allied superiority was only potential inthe sense that it depended on Britain and Russianot being defeated. The US would make its mil-
itary weight felt in Europe only in 1943 and
1944.For Britain the danger of invasion finallypassed in 1941. With Germany fully engaged inthe east, there remained no possibility of mount-
ing an invasion of the British Isles as well. But
this did not mean that there was no longer any
danger that Britain might be forced to submit. It
remained beleaguered, dependent for longer-term survival on supplies reaching it from over-seas, above all from the US. Britain’s own
resources, great though they were when fully
mobilised, were not sufﬁcient both to sustain the
war effort and to feed all the people. For Britain’ssuccess in mobilising its material and humanresources much credit must go to Ernest Bevin,
a leading trade unionist who had entered
Churchill’s national government as minister of
labour in 1940. The British people accepted anunprecedented degree of direction of labour andof rationing. Even so, supplies from overseas
became increasingly essential. Lend-Lease made
possible the purchase of war supplies in the US
without payment of cash. But they still had to
reach Britain.The conﬂict at sea, the battle of the Atlantic,was therefore as vital to Britain as the land battles
had been to France in 1940. The sinkings by
German U-boats in 1941 and 1942 could only be
made good by the output from US yards. BeforePearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Hitler hadgiven orders that American vessels supplying
Britain and their escorting US warships were not to
be attacked. His hands had been tied. After Pearl
Harbor he welcomed the outbreak of war between
Japan and the US, and declared war on theAmericans himself, removing the restrictions onthe U-boat war in the Atlantic. Now, he thought,
Britain would be forced to its knees. In November
1942 U-boats sank 729,000 tons, and for the year
as a whole almost 8 million tons or 1,664 ships.These losses were inﬂicted by about 200 sub-
marines and could no longer be made good. The
tide was turned in the spring of 1943. By the end
of May airpower, improved radar and ‘Ultra’ prac-
tically drove the U-boats from the Atlantic. Thesubmarine had been the greatest threat. Germany’ssurface ﬂeet was not sufﬁciently strong to challenge
Britain’s supremacy. Hitler’s battleships were elim-

inated after some spectacular engagements. The
Graf Speesank in 1939, the Bismarckin 1941 andthe crippled Tirpitzby air attack in 1944. Supplieswere carried across the Atlantic by convoys. By far
the most hazardous route for these merchant ves-

sels was from Scotland and Iceland to Murmansk
to aid Russia. But by the end of 1943 not only had
the Germans lost the battle of the seas, they hadalso sustained defeats on land from which therewould be no recovery. The darkest years of the war
were over for Britain. Churchill’s contribution to
maintaining British morale would be difﬁcult to

overestimate.Britain’s warfare with Italy and Germany on landin 1941 and 1942, judged by the numbers of men
engaged, was secondary when compared with the
millions of German and Russian troops locked inbattle in the Soviet Union. Yet strategically theregion of the eastern Mediterranean, known
loosely as the Middle East and lying between
neutral Turkey and the Italian colony of Libya,
was a vital one. During the inter-war years it was
dominated by Britain and France not as outrightcolonial powers but as the powers holding LeagueMandates. Both Britain and France had problems
with their Mandates. From 1936 onwards, Arab
militancy forced Britain to station 30,000 troops
in Palestine. But after the British government’sdecision in 1939 to restrict the immigration ofthe Jews there was relative calm until 1944.Hitler’s Arab policy was ambiguous. Whilewelcoming Arab hostility to Britain, the Nazis
were not prepared to give unequivocal promises
of future independence to the Arab states. ButArab attitudes were determined by Arab hostilityto Britain and France as the occupying powers.
Thus Egypt, nominally independent, and though
being ‘defended’ by Britain, was pro-German
during the war and was actually occupied byBritain. Iraq, Britain’s Mandate, achieved inde-pendence in 1930 under British sponsorship but
was closely linked to Britain economically and
militarily. What was important to Britain was that278THE SECOND WORLD WAR
Iraq and its eastern neighbour, Persia, were themajor suppliers of oil in the region.Britain’s Middle Eastern dominance was seri-
ously threatened in 1941 by Germany. Germany’s
victory over France stimulated Arab nationalism.
The Vichy French authorities in the Lebanon andSyria, moreover, were not pro-British in their sym-
pathies; while in Iraq, a group that favoured
Germany staged a military coup and drove out the
regime in power, which had been friendly to
Britain. Turkey, fearful of German power, decided
on neutrality and so did not, as expected, joinBritain. If Hitler had followed his Balkan cam-
paigns in the spring of 1941 by advancing into the
Middle East, there would have been no sufﬁciently

strong British forces to oppose the Germans.
Instead, Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in June1941. Germany might nevertheless have reachedPersia and the Persian Gulf by way of southern
Russia. But Russia’s defence of the Caucasus
blocked that path. Britain, meanwhile, despite its
militarily weak position, decided on offensiveaction. Together with Free French troops, a rela-
tively small British force invaded Syria and the
Lebanon and overcame Vichy French resistance.
Britain intervened in Iraq and restored the pro-
British regime. Persia was also invaded in conjunc-

tion with the Russians. In Persia and the Arabworld, including Egypt, Britain had secured itsstrategic interests by force against local political
nationalist groups. From Britain’s point of view,
Arab national feelings could not be permitted to
jeopardise the war effort.In North Africa on the western frontiers ofEgypt, British and Dominion troops fought the
Axis. The fortunes of this desert war varied dra-
matically until October 1942 when the battle of
Alamein finally broke the offensive power of
General Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps.General Bernard Montgomery had built up anarmy of 195,000 men with a thousand tanks,
almost double the size of the German–Italian
army. At Alamein he outgunned and outwitted
Rommel, who had to withdraw hastily.Britain’s Alamein victory ended the disastroussequence of British defeats. A trap was sprung.
Rommel’s line of retreat was being simultaneously
cut off by Anglo-American landings in his rear.There had been much inter-Allied dispute onwhere an Anglo-American force could best strikeagainst Hitler’s Europe in 1942. Roosevelt and
the American generals favoured an assault on
France. Their reasoning was political as well as
military. Stalin was pressing for a ‘second front’ torelieve pressure in the east by forcing the Germansto transfer forty divisions to the west. But the
Americans were quite unrealistic about the time
needed for so difﬁcult an undertaking. An unsuc-

cessful commando raid on Dieppe in August 1942
showed how hard it would be to establish abridgehead. Shortage of landing craft meant thatno more than ten Allied divisions could have been
sent across the Channel in 1942. Churchill and
the British chiefs of staff were in any case opposed
to a premature invasion of France. Agreement waseventually reached that an Anglo-American forceshould land in Vichy French North Africa in
November 1942. General Dwight Eisenhower
commanded this whole operation, codenamed
Torch. At ﬁrst the Vichy French forces resisted thelandings but then agreed to an armistice. TheAllies were thus able to occupy French Morocco
and Algeria virtually unopposed.Hitler responded to the Allied invasion ofNorth Africa by sending his troops into the hith-
erto unoccupied regions of Vichy France. Britainhad always feared that this would happen and thatthe French ﬂeet would then fall into German
hands. In fact the French ﬂeet in Toulon eluded
a German takeover by scuttling itself. Hitler also
sent in troops from Sicily to occupy FrenchTunisia in North Africa. Rommel, meanwhile,fought and retreated westwards from Libya. The
real ﬁghting between the Allies and the Italian
and German forces then occurred in Tunisia and
lasted until May 1943, when a total of 150,000
troops (both Italian and German) ﬁnally capitu-lated. It was a major victory for the Anglo-American forces. Even so, the scale of the ﬁghting
in North Africa cannot be compared with that of
the Russian front. Here, the main war on land was
being waged.On 22 June 1941 the greatest military force everassembled invaded the Soviet Union with almost
3.6 million German and Axis soldiers, 3,600 tanks1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5279
and 2,700 planes. This included fourteenRomanian divisions. With the Panzers racing
ahead in best Blitzkriegtradition, the Sovietarmies in the west were to be smashed by a three-pronged attack. The Germany army was divided
into three groups – north, centre and south. The
army of the north drove through the former
Baltic states with Leningrad as its goal. The armyof the centre made its thrust in the direction ofSmolensk and Moscow, and the army group
south invaded the Ukraine.The purpose of these deep thrusts was toencircle and to destroy the Red Army in westernRussia, and to prevent a Russian retreat into thevastness of Soviet territory. The victorious
German armies expected to control European
Russia from the Volga to Archangel. A ‘military
frontier’ could then be established against Asiatic
Russia, where the Japanese ally later might beencouraged to colonise parts of Siberia.Territorially, Germany almost achieved her objec-
tive of conquering the whole of European Russiain 1941 and 1942. Yet the Soviet Union was notdefeated and the Blitzkriegturned into a war ofattrition, during which the greater Soviet reserves
of manpower and the increasing output of her
armament industry turned the tide of the waragainst Hitler’s Germany.After the initial and spectacular victories of thebattles of the frontiers during the ﬁrst weeks of the
war, when the Germans took hundreds of thou-
sands of Russian prisoners and whole Russianarmies disintegrated, the German generals andHitler disagreed on which of the three offensives
was to be the main effort. Thus already in August
of 1941 the basic weakness of Germany’s latest
Blitzkriegbecame evident. Speaking to Goebbelson 18 August, Hitler bitterly complained about280THE SECOND WORLD WAR

The German invasion of Russia, 1941–2the failures of military intelligence before the war.Instead of the expected 5,000 tanks, the Sovietsdisposed of 20,000. Goebbels reﬂected that had
the true strength of the Soviet Union been
known: ‘Perhaps we would have drawn back from
tackling the questions of the East and Bolshevismwhich had fallen due.’ What a momentous ‘per-haps’, on which the whole course of the war was
to depend! During the ﬁrst six weeks the Germans
lost 60,000 dead; newspaper columns in Germany
were ﬁlled with small black iron crosses announc-
ing a son or husband fallen for Führer andFatherland. As the Germans penetrated the SovietUnion the already vast front from the Black Sea to
the Baltic of more than 1,000 miles lengthened
even further. The same tactics that had worked 
in the ‘conﬁned’ space of France failed in the vastness of the Soviet Union. Though Stalin wascompletely stunned by the German attack, not
expecting it, despite all warnings, to be launched
before 1942, huge Russian reserves of manpower
and the setting up of industrial complexes beyondthe Urals meant that the Soviet military capacityto resist was not destroyed.But Stalin’s fear of provoking Germany by tak-ing adequate preparatory measures had left the
Soviet armies unprepared and exposed to German
encirclements at the outset. The Germans cap-tured more than 3 million prisoners between Juneand December 1941. But if the Soviet Union
could avoid actual defeat in 1941 and 1942 it
would then become impossible for the German
armies to defeat the more numerous Sovietarmies, whose weapons matched, and in the caseof the T-34 tank even outclassed, those of the
Germans. First the autumn rains and the mud and
then the winter weather caught the German
armies unprepared. Not only did the troops freeze
during the particularly severe winter of 1941–2,but much of the mechanised equipment becameunusable in the Arctic frosts. Russia’s two greatest
cities, Leningrad and Moscow, were the goals of
the central and northern German armies.
Leningrad was almost surrounded by the Germansand the Finns.The siege of Leningrad is an epic of theSecond World War. It lasted from September
1941 to January 1944. During the siege 641,803people died from hunger and disease alone. TheSoviet spirit of resistance was not broken. Almostthree-quarters of a million German troops were
bogged down around the city for 900 days. The
Germans were also denied the capture of
Moscow, although they reached the southernsuburbs. Germany’s defeats were not due to‘General Winter’ alone, but to the skill and
heroism of the Soviet forces facing the invaders.
The German high command was forced to admit
that for the ﬁrst time a Blitzkrieghad failed. Thewar was not over in the east; the war of attritionthat had defeated Germany in 1914–18 andwhich Hitler had done everything to escape, was
just beginning.There are occasions when secret intelligenceplays a crucial role in war. The Soviets had a spy in Tokyo, Richard Sorge, a German press corres-pondent who had predicted the date of the
German attack almost to the day. The warning
appears to have fallen on deaf ears. But when he
passed on the information that the Japanesewould strike south and not attack the SovietUnion just before his arrest as a spy, and Japanese
military inactivity conﬁrmed his tip off, Stalin,

though still suspicious, gradually withdrew those
troops facing the Japanese after the Siberian 
campaigning season was over (Sorge was impris-oned and executed in 1944). With the help ofthese troops and other reinforcements, Marshal
Zhukov, the most outstanding general on the
Soviet side during the war, organised the defence
of Russia’s capital. In December 1941 fresh Sovietdivisions counter-attacked and the Germans wereforced to give up territory, but their own retreat
was orderly. They were not routed or captured in
huge numbers as the Russians had been. Although
the Russians did not yet enjoy superiority in men
or materials on the Moscow front, the Germanswere severely disadvantaged by the length of andlack of adequate rail and road supply lines to their
own troops.Stalin’s mistakes in carrying on the Russianoffensives in the spring of 1942, believing theGerman armies virtually beaten, led to major mil-itary disasters on the Kharkov front in the south
in May and June 1942 and in the Crimea.
Hundreds of thousands more Soviet troops were282THE SECOND WORLD WAR
lost. Stalin, expecting the Germans to renew theirmain drive on Moscow, concentrated Russianreserves on the central front. Instead the main
German blow was delivered in the south. The
Crimea, including Sevastopol, was taken. The
Germans drove forward to the city of Stalingradon the Volga, intending to cut off the whole ofRussia south of that city including the oil-rich
Caucasus, which formed the gateway to Persia.In the ruins of Stalingrad the Russians, ﬁght-ing from house to house, made their stand. The
battle lasted from mid-August to mid-November1942. Stalin and Hitler were locked in a titanicproxy struggle for supremacy. Hitler decided that
Stalingrad would be taken come what may and
that Germany would not withdraw. Stalin sent
Zhukov to mastermind the defence of the cityregardless of casualties. Most of the city was takenby the Germans in October, and the Russian
defenders’ reinforcements were limited as fresh
divisions were being husbanded in preparation for
a great counter-offensive. On 19 November 1942the Russians launched their attack and encircledthe 250,000 men of Germany’s Sixth Army ﬁght-
ing in Stalingrad. Hitler ordered the Sixth Army
to stand fast. Losing the opportunity to link up
with the German armies to the rear, it was
doomed. Fierce fighting continued until 2February 1943. A total of 91,000 survivors sur-rendered, including Field Marshal von Paulus
who capitulated earlier, on 31 January. The
Wehrmacht had been decisively defeated, and,
more than that, the myth of Hitler’s infallible mil-itary genius had been exploded. The world knewStalingrad marked a turning point in the war.
Soviet strength would increase as Germany’s
diminished. By the summer of 1943 the Russians
had also won superiority in the air, with thou-
sands of planes engaged on each side.Had there been wholesale defections from the forced union of Soviet socialist republics the
whole prospect of the war might have changed.
The almost unbelievable number of prisoners that
the Germans took in 1941 suggests not only mil-itary defeat but also large-scale desertions. ButHitler resisted those of his advisers who wished
to utilise this anti-communist and anti-Russian
sentiment. The peasants hungered for land andfor release from the collective farms. A capturedRussian general, Andrei Vlasov, offered to raise anarmy from prisoners of war to fight Stalin’s
Russia. But Hitler’s racist fanaticism stood in the
way of winning the war by these means. European
Russia was designated as colonial territory, even-tually to be depopulated as necessary to provideroom for the new German settlers. The Slavs were
‘subhumans’; nearly 3 million were sent to
Germany to work as slave labour. With the
Germans ransacking the Russian territories they
occupied, the early welcome that they receivedturned to hatred. Partisan resistance increasedbehind German lines and was met by ruthless
terror. Only too late in 1943 and 1944 did
Himmler try to change a German policy bound
to alienate the local population and to recruit forthe German army from among the minorities.Meanwhile Stalin skilfully appealed to Russian
patriotism and encouraged all the peoples of the
Soviet republics to turn out the invaders.Hitler tenaciously clung to one hope even whensurrounded in his bunker in burning Berlin in
April 1945, that the ‘unholy’ and unnatural
alliance between Britain, the US and the Soviet
Union would fall apart and that the Western
powers would recognise that he was ﬁghting thecommon Bolshevik enemy. Though Churchill,more so than Roosevelt, foresaw that there would
be post-war conﬂict with the Soviet Union, his
conviction of the need to destroy the evils of
Nazism was unshakeable. The holding together ofthe grand alliance was a precondition of victory.Was this also Stalin’s perception of Britishpolicy? Did Stalin, pathologically suspicious of the
motives of all possible enemies, have any faith in
Britain’s determination to ﬁght Hitler’s Germany
to the ﬁnish? Despite Churchill’s immediate andunqualiﬁed promise of support the moment theGermans invaded Russia, suspicion of any antag-
onist past, present or future was second nature to
Stalin. The continuing delays in the opening of a
second front in France through 1942, then 1943,must have conﬁrmed his fears that the reason fordelay was mainly political not military. He bitterly
complained to Churchill, charging him with
breaches of faith. He may well have concluded1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5283
that the West was deliberately prolonging the warto weaken the Soviet Union in the bloodbath ofthe eastern front in order to dictate the future
from a position of strength. The longer European
Russia remained in German hands, the more dif-
ficult it would be to re-establish communistautocracy over the non-Russian peoples. Hence itbecame for Stalin almost a test of Britain’s good
faith that Russia’s right to its 1941 frontiers
should be accepted by Britain and the US and not
become a matter of negotiation after the war was
won. The 1941 frontiers included the additionalterritory the Soviet Union had acquired as a resultof the deal struck with Nazi Germany: eastern
Poland, the Baltic states, Bessarabia and northern
Bukovina, and also the territories taken from
Finland after the Soviet–Finnish War.The British position at ﬁrst was to reject anyfrontier changes until after the war was over and
peace negotiations took place. Roosevelt, mindful
of his own Polish minority in America and of the
condemnation of the ‘secret deals’ of the FirstWorld War, at first resisted even more firmlyEuropean frontier discussions. But Churchill and
Eden were anxious to appease Stalin at a time
when the Red Army was bearing the brunt of the
war on land. An Anglo-Russian agreement for
jointly waging war against Germany had beensigned in Moscow on 12 July 1941; on 26 May1942 it was replaced by a formal twenty-year
alliance. Churchill also responded courteously to
Stalin’s angry and wounding messages about the
lack of a second front. But there was much appre-hension in London that Stalin might lose conﬁ-dence in his Western allies and strike a deal with
Hitler. Everything was avoided that might add to
his suspicions. This had one important conse-

quence. Discussions with emissaries from the
German resistance, or with representatives sent byHimmler’s SS to bargain over the lives of theHungarian Jews, were avoided for fear that they
would compromise Britain and lead Stalin to the
wrong conclusion that a separate peace was being
considered.Among Hitler’s entourage were advisers andallies who urged him to seek a separate peace with
the Soviet Union. But the struggle against the
Bolsheviks and Jews lay at the core of his ideology.He rejected peace with his arch-enemies thoughhe admired Stalin’s ruthlessness. His barbarity inRussia and the carrying through of the Final
Solution while the war was being lost militarily
show that ideology ultimately dominated Hitler’s
actions when Realpolitikwould have served theinterests of the Third Reich. As for Stalin it is pos-
sible that he welcomed the West’s belief that he
had an alternative to war with Germany for it
would make Britain and the US more willing to
accede to Russia’s military and political demands.The question of the future of Poland was the most difﬁcult for Britain and the US to solve.The Polish government in exile demanded that the
independence of its state be restored within the
frontiers of 1939, that is of pre-war Poland.But Stalin had already annexed and incorpo-rated in the Soviet Union the portions of Polandoccupied in September 1939 and insisted on a
post-war Poland ‘friendly’ to the Soviet Union.
With the Red Army inevitably overrunning
Poland there was, in effect, little the US andBritain could do to force Stalin to renounce ter-ritory which he claimed as Soviet already. The
Polish government in exile in London was in a
hopeless situation. General Sikorski, who headed
the Polish government in exile in London, had at
ﬁrst tried to work with the Russians. He hadsigned an agreement for Russo-Polish coopera-tion with Stalin in 1941 but, from the ﬁrst, two
issues clouded Polish–Soviet relations: the ques-
tion of Poland’s eastern frontier and the thou-
sands of missing Polish ofﬁcers who should havere-emerged from Russian prisoner-of-war campsafter the 1941 agreement had been concluded.
The corpses of Polish officers found by the
Germans near Smolensk in the Katyn forest pro-
vided a grisly explanation for their disappearance
and ruptured relations between the Polish gov-ernment and the Kremlin in April 1943. TheRussians formed their own Polish military units
and an embryonic rival Polish government, the
Union of Polish Patriots.The fate of Poland was virtually decided at the first summit conference when Roosevelt,Churchill and Stalin met in Teheran in Persia
from 28 November to 1 December 1943. There
was no formal agreement, but Churchill agreed284THE SECOND WORLD WAR
on behalf of Britain, and Roosevelt personallyacquiesced too, to the Soviet Union’s retainingeastern Poland as far as the Curzon Line (the
armistice line between Poland and Russia pro-
posed by the British foreign secretary Lord
Curzon in 1920) and that Poland should becompensated with German territory east of therivers Oder and Neisse. At the Yalta Conference
more than a year later (4–11 February 1945),
with Poland by then overrun by the Red Army,
despite some ambiguities in the ofﬁcial declara-
tions Stalin secured his territorial ambitions atPoland’s expense. For his part Stalin promisedthat he would allow all the liberated peoples in
Eastern and central Europe to choose their own
governments freely and democratically. Power
had passed to a Polish provisional governmentwhich was based in the Soviet Union and whichsome ‘London’ Poles were permitted to join. At
Teheran and Yalta, military needs and realities, as
well as hopes for post-war cooperation, decided
Churchill and Roosevelt to accept Stalin’sdemands that Soviet conditions concerning thefuture frontiers of Russia be met in all but formal
treaty form before the conclusion of the war.Until 1945 there was little link between thewar waged in Europe and Africa and the war
waged by Japan, Britain, China and the US ineastern and south-eastern Asia. The Soviet Unionwas not a party to the Paciﬁc war until shortly
before its end. Japan and the Soviet Union signed
a neutrality treaty in April 1941 and the two coun-
tries remained at peace until Russia declared waron Japan just one week before Japan’s surrender.Roosevelt and Churchill never wavered from theirearly determination after Japan’s attack on Pearl
Harbor in December 1941 that despite the mili-
tary disasters in eastern Asia the defeat ofGermany must come ﬁrst. Japan’s victories cameas a tremendous shock to British and Dominion
public opinion. The Western empires of the
Dutch, French and British and the American hold
on the Philippines collapsed in just a few weeksand the whole region fell for the ﬁrst time underthe control of one power, Japan.In Malaya, Britain had constructed theSingapore naval base and Churchill had insistedon sending to it two battleships, the Prince ofWalesand the Repulse, intending thereby to deterthe Japanese from going to war. In Malaya the
British commanded 89,000 troops, including
37,000 Indian, 19,000 British and 15,000
Australians. In the Dutch East Indies 35,000Dutch regular troops were stationed. TheAmericans had posted 31,000 regulars to the
Philippines. But the British, Dutch and American
troops were poorly equipped. Air defence in 
particular was inadequate, which gave the
Japanese a decisive advantage. Almost immedi-ately after the outbreak of the war the Japanesesank the Prince of Walesand the Repulsefrom theair. There were now no battleships left to oppose
them. The attack on Pearl Harbor had knocked
out the capacity of the US fleet to challengeJapan’s offensive. The capture of Guam and WakeIslands denied the US naval bases beyond Hawaii.
In Malaya the well-equipped and skilfully led
Japanese army began the invasion on 8 December
and, though only 60,800 in strength, over-whelmed the British defence forces, which ﬁnallycapitulated in Singapore on 15 February 1942.
Some 62,000 troops under British command 
surrendered, a stunning military defeat when
added to the shock provoked by the sinking 
of the Repulseand Prince of Wales. The fall ofSingapore was also a great psychological blowwhich undermined the faith of Asian peoples in
‘white’ superiority.General Douglas MacArthur defended thePhilippines. The Japanese gained air control andtheir invading army defeated the Americans, whowithdrew to the Bataan peninsula in January
1942; the Americans ﬁnally had to surrender their
last fortress defence on 9 April with 70,000
troops, a disaster comparable to Singapore, except
that the defence had been long drawn out andskilfully conducted. Simultaneously with the inva-sion of Malaya, another Japanese army crossed
from Thailand into Burma and by the end of April
had driven the weak British forces into India. The
Dutch East Indies were captured between Januaryand March 1942. Throughout these ﬁve monthsof victorious campaigns the Japanese had suf-
fered only some 15,000 killed and wounded and
had taken more than ten times as many Allied1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5285
troops prisoner. The whole of south-east Asia hadfallen under Japanese domination.British rule seemed to be threatened now atthe very heart of the empire, British India. The
position was regarded as sufﬁciently desperate for
the British Cabinet to send out Sir Stafford Crippswith a promise to the leaders of the IndianCongress Party that India would be granted inde-
pendence after the war. A constituent assembly
would be called to decide whether it would
remain within or outside the Commonwealth.
Meanwhile, during the war, the Congress Partywould be granted some participation in, but notcontrol of, government. Congress rejected the
proposals, partly because Cripps also offered to
the Muslim League the possibility of secession for
the predominantly Muslim parts of India (laterPakistan). Gandhi, India’s greatest voice of non-violent opposition, now called on Britain simply
to ‘quit India’. He expected non-violence to
defeat Britain and Japan and to win India for the
385 million Indians. The viceroy of India reactedwith repression and arrested the Congress leadersand Gandhi. India did not rise against the British,
and the Indian army fought under British
command against the Japanese. The Japanese also
created an Indian ‘liberation’ army from prison-
ers of war mainly taken at Singapore and foundedthe Indian Independence League. In 1943 anIndian nationalist, Subhas Chandra Bose, ex-
president of the Indian Congress, took over the
Indian ‘government’ operating with the Japanese.
Though Bose had a good deal of success amongIndians beyond British control, his impact withinIndia was limited and never threatened British
rule. The problem of Indian independence was
now shelved until the war was won.Militarily the Japanese expansion in the Paciﬁcand south-east Asia was checked by the summerof 1942. In the naval battle of the Coral Sea inMay 1942 Japan’s thrust towards Australia was
blunted when the Japanese attack on Port
Moresby in New Guinea was called off as a result
of the naval engagement. Far more serious for theJapanese was the failure of their attack in June onthe American-held Midway Island. Admiral
Yamamoto was in overall command of the most
powerful fleet of battleships, aircraft carriers,cruisers, destroyers and submarines the Japanesehad ever assembled. Its task was not only to coverthe Japanese landing force, but to destroy the
remaining US Paciﬁc ﬂeet. Yamamoto had separ-
ated his ﬂeet. It was a naval battle dominated by
the aircraft carriers on both sides. The Japaneselost four of their eight carriers, the Americansonly one, before Yamamoto’s main ﬂeet could
join the engagement. Yamamoto decided to break
off the battle and from then on had lost the ini-
tiative in the Paciﬁc. It was now certain that the
American war effort, once fully developed, wouldoverwhelm Japan eventually. Just as in Europe,where Hitler’s Blitzkrieghad failed finally in1942, so did Japan’s oriental Blitzkriegnow failin its purpose of forcing its principal enemies to
accept Japan’s claim to predominance in easternand southern Asia.The American counter-offensive in the Paciﬁcbegan in August 1942 with the American attack
on the tiny Japanese-held island of Guadalcanal,
one of the Solomon group of islands. The ﬁght-ing between the American marines and thedefending Japanese was ferocious and casualties
on both sides were heavy, until the Americans
overwhelmed the fanatical defenders. This was to
become the pattern of the remorseless Paciﬁc war
until Japan’s surrender.The Japanese war with Britain, the Dominionsand the US brought relief to the Chinese, who
had been at war with the Japanese alone since
1937. Chiang Kai-shek now avoided active battles
with the Japanese as far as possible. His eyes wereﬁrmly set on the future when, with the Anglo-American defeat of the Japanese, he would gain
mastery over all China, including the commu-
nists, his theoretical allies against Japan. Despite
the growing corruption of the Kuomintang and
the inefﬁciency of Chiang Kai-shek’s armies, theUS based its hopes for the future peace andprogress of eastern Asia on the emergence of a
strong and democratic Chinese Republic linked 
in friendship to the US. Roosevelt did not wish
to see the restoration of the pre-war special rightsof Europe in China or the re-establishment of theEuropean empires in eastern Asia. In January
1945 he expressed his hopes to his secretary of
state that US policy:286THE SECOND WORLD WAR
was based on the belief that despite the tem-porary weakness of China and the possibility ofrevolutions and civil war, 450 million Chinese
would someday become united and mod-
ernised and would be the most important
factor in the whole Far East.The problem during the last two years of theland war in Asia was to get Chiang Kai-shek’s
armies to put up any resistance at all to the
Japanese, who renewed their offensives and occu-
pied large new areas of eastern China in 1944.The Japanese overran the American-built airﬁeldsfrom which they had been bombed. Chiang Kai-
shek, meanwhile, positioned half a million of his
best troops in the north to contain the commu-
nists and was preserving his armies for a futurewar of supremacy in China after the Westernpowers had defeated Japan. Throughout 1944
the tension between Roosevelt and Chiang Kai-
shek grew. Roosevelt had little faith in the
Chinese leader. He wished to force on him theappointment of an American general to commandall the Chinese armies and to bring about effec-
tive cooperation between the communists and the
Kuomintang against the Japanese. A China policy
that would reconcile China and serve America’s
global interests continued to elude the US.During the course of 1943 the tide of war turneddecisively against Japan, Italy and Germany. The
enormous industrial resources of the US alone,
when fully mobilised for war, exceeded all thatGermany, Japan and their allies could producetogether. The Soviet Union and Russia were by
now more than a match for the military strength
Germany had built up in the east. It was only the
tenacity and skill of Germany’s armies, despite
Hitler’s disastrous interferences as at Stalingrad,that enabled Germany to stave off defeat for solong. Germany did not collapse even when the
ordinary man in the street knew the war was lost
and had no conﬁdence left in Hitler’s promised
‘wonder’ weapons. They fought to the bitter end,until Hitler had shot himself and the crushingsuperiority of the Allied armies closing in from all
sides made further resistance a physical impossi-
bility. Until close to the end of the war, Hitler’sregime could still successfully terrorise and killanyone who openly refused orders to ﬁght to thelast. Equally important was German fear of
Russian conquest and occupation. Nazi propa-
ganda had successfully indoctrinated the German
people into believing that the Russian subhumansfrom the east would destroy, loot and kill and thatit was better to die resisting than to fall into
Russian hands. Early experiences of the Russian
armies when they first invaded East Prussia
appeared to conﬁrm this belief.But a separate peace with the West, the prin-cipal hope of those who had plotted againstHitler during the later stages of the war, was not
a possibility. In practice the Western Allies could
follow no other policy than to demand that
Germany must surrender unconditionally on allfronts simultaneously. The actual phrase ‘uncon-ditional surrender’ emerged during discussions
between Roosevelt and Churchill when they met
at Casablanca in January 1943 to coordinate and
agree on Anglo-American strategy. Rooseveltgave it ofﬁcial public backing in speaking to thepress. It meant that Britain and the US would not
entertain any bargaining over peace terms with
Germany, Italy and Japan and would ﬁght until
complete military victory had been achieved.It has been argued that the call for uncondi-tional surrender made the enemies of the Alliesﬁght more fanatically to the bitter end and that
the war might have been shortened by a more ﬂex-
ible Allied attitude. The evidence of Germany’s
and Italy’s behaviour in 1944 and 1945 does notsupport this view. The Italians were able to over-throw Mussolini and in fact negotiate their sur-
render, whereas Hitler’s grasp over Germany
remained so complete, and his own attitude so
utterly uncompromising, that no negotiated peace
was possible short of Germany’s total collapse,even if any of the Allies had desired to negotiatefor peace. The advantages of having proclaimed as
a war aim ‘unconditional surrender’ on the other
hand were solid. Allied differences on how to treat
a conquered Germany could be kept secret since the Allied public had been satisﬁed by thedemand of ‘unconditional surrender’. Moreover,
Roosevelt and Churchill hoped that the call for
unconditional surrender would reassure Stalin in1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5287
the absence of an early second front. In January1943 Britain’s and America’s military effort onland did not compare with that of Russia, where
the ﬁnal phase of the Stalingrad battle was raging.Within the Grand Alliance, or United Nationsas all the countries ﬁghting Germany came to becalled, there was an inner Anglo-Americanalliance. A joint strategic body, the combined
chiefs of staff, was set up soon after Pearl Harbor
to provide a forum for debate on strategy and
eventual decision-making. Joint Anglo-American
commands were created as necessary. There areno parallels in modern history of such close coor-dination of policy as was achieved by the US and
Britain during the last three and a half war years.
It was based on the trust and working relation-
ships at the top between Roosevelt and Churchill.Stalin would never have agreed to a jointcommand, and the Soviet Union remained an
outsider fighting its own war with Germany,
which engaged in 1942 and 1943 two-thirds of
the total number of German divisions.Joint Anglo-American planning bodies did notmean, however, that there was perfect harmony.
The American military argued for a concentration
of all effort on the earliest possible cross-Channel
attack on France and so a blow at Germany’s
vitals. Churchill and his British military adviserswarned against any premature landings, whichmight fail. Roosevelt, fearful in 1942 of the possi-
bility that the Soviet forces might collapse unless
some of the German forces were diverted, was
inclined to listen to Stalin’s appeals more sympa-thetically. Churchill molliﬁed Stalin, convincinghim that the projected landings in Vichy North
Africa were a genuine second front. The successful
completion of these operations in May 1943 was
too late to allow for a switching of resources nec-
essary to mount a cross-Channel attack in 1943.Churchill argued in favour of a Mediterraneanstrategy and attacking Italy, the ‘soft underbelly’
of the Axis. Churchill’s reasons were based on his
appraisal of military alternatives. The Germans
were weakest in the Mediterranean and if theAllies carried the war into the Balkans then theGerman armies would be trapped between them
and the Russians. The Allies, moreover, would be
able to link with Tito’s Yugoslav partisans. TheAmericans wanted to concentrate all forces on anattack on France, but agreed that the NorthAfrican forces could be used to invade Sicily next.The rapid fall of Sicily to the Anglo-Americanforces in July 1943 marked the end of Mussolini’s
hold on power. The fascist leaders and KingVictor Emmanuel could see the writing on thewall. The way out for Italy was to jettison the
German alliance and to change sides if possible.
Military defeat and the imminent invasion of Italy
had weakened Mussolini’s position sufﬁciently to
make it possible to overthrow him. The duce wasdismissed from his ofﬁce not by a popular revo-lution but by the king and his fascist collabora-
tors on 24 and 25 July 1943. He was then
imprisoned until rescued by the Germans. The
king appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio asMussolini’s successor. But Badoglio and thefascist leaders failed to save Italy from becoming
a battleground. Despite the promise to continue
the war, German suspicions were aroused and
reinforcements were sent to Italy. The newregime held secret negotiations with the Allies,but did not persuade them to land in northern
Italy to enable the Italians to avoid a German
occupation. The Anglo-American plan envisaged
occupying only southern Italy. This made it pos-
sible for the Germans to seize the remainder ofItaly when Italy’s surrender was made public on8 September 1943. Naples was reached by the
Allies on 1 October. The Germans by then had
established a strong defensive line across the
Italian peninsula. The king and the Italian gov-ernment ﬂed south behind the Allied lines andthen declared war on Germany, while Hitler
restored Mussolini to act as a puppet dictator over
the republic he had proclaimed. Until the close
of the war in May 1945, the Allied armies had to
ﬁght their way gradually north, piercing heavilyfortiﬁed lines which the Germans created in theirpath. Meanwhile, a guerrilla war was fought in the
north by the partisans, whose aim was not only
to drive out the Germans but also to bring about
radical social change in Italy.Mussolini did not survive the military defeat of his ally. Captured by Italian partisans, he,
together with his mistress, was hanged in public
by them. The Italian campaign did not prove to288THE SECOND WORLD WAR
be a rapid success and entailed some of the heav-iest ﬁghting of the war. But Hitler’s decision todefend Italy and so keep the Allies as far as pos-
sible away from south Germany diverted many
divisions to its defence and to the defence of the
Balkans, which had become vulnerable.While in July 1943 the British and Americanarmies invaded Sicily, the largest tank battle of the
war was being waged at Kursk on the Russian
front. The German attack on the Russian salient
was beaten back by Marshal Zhukov. It was thelast occasion on which the Germans were able tomount a major offensive in Russia. Both sides suf-
fered huge casualties, but the Russian armour had
proved superior and the Russians, unlike the
Germans, could make good such losses. SuccessiveRussian offensives drove the German armies backin heavy ﬁghting into Poland, but they halted the
Russians on the River Vistula. The Warsaw rising
(1 August–2 October 1944) did not induce the
Red Army at all costs to reach the Polish capital.In mid-September Russian attempts to advancewere repelled by the Germans, who remained in
control of Warsaw until the end of the year.
Further south, Russian armies advanced from the
Ukraine into Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and
Hungary. As in Italy, new governments attemptedto change from the German to the Russian side.But the Germans were still strong enough to
remove the Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy
from power and to make a stand against the
Russian armies. Budapest did not surrender to theRussians until February 1945. But Hitler could nolonger in 1944 place the bulk of his armies to
defend the eastern front.On 6 June 1944 under General DwightEisenhower’s supreme command the successful
cross-Channel invasion of France began. Thetremendous obstacles to this enterprise had beenovercome by meticulous planning and brilliant
execution. Beaches and bases were won and by
the end of July 1944 1.5 million men had been
landed in France. After the battle of Normandy,Paris was taken on 25 August and the Germantroops were pursued as they retreated from
France. A landing in southern France against the
depleted German forces there enabled the Alliesrapidly to liberate most of France. The Alliesreached the southern Netherlands and the north-ern Franco-German frontier between Aachen and
Trier in September.Meanwhile Hitler had launched his promisedwonder weapons, the pilotless aircraft-bomb, theV-1, and the missile bomb, V-2, against London.The attacks by these new weapons on London
and Antwerp in the summer and autumn of 1944
did much damage but could not alter the course
of the war. The last of these ingenious bombs hit
Antwerp in March 1945.One problem that could not wait any longer forsolution was who was to be recognised as repre-
senting the free government of France. There
could be no question that Pétain’s Vichy regimehad forfeited all its claims by collaborating withthe Germans. Of all the countries that had been
overrun by the Germans, France was the only
indubitable pre-war great power. Yet ironically it
was the one ally not represented by a governmentin exile in London. The Free French, who hadrallied to General de Gaulle in 1940 and formed
their own administration in London, were recog-
nised only as the French Committee of National
Liberation. De Gaulle felt his inferior status
deeply. But his status corresponded to reality inthat the majority of people in France and in theFrench Empire accepted Pétain’s authority. Not
that this would have stopped the British and
Americans in wartime from according recognition
to de Gaulle. Expediency, however, persuadedthem not to challenge Vichy France openly. Apowerful French ﬂeet after all was still in Vichy
hands in 1942. When the Allies made their North
African landings in November 1942, Operation
Torch, it was with the Vichy authorities there that
secret negotiations were conducted to avoid thehostility of the French army units stationed there.Admiral Darlan, who happened to be in Algiers,
decided to support the Americans. Soon after that
he was assassinated. De Gaulle was regarded as

The disparity between the reality of theFrench position and de Gaulle’s behaviour struck
Churchill and Roosevelt at the time as incongru-
ous. But Churchill, with more imagination,
insight and sympathy than Roosevelt, urged afterthe Allied invasion of France in June 1944 that deGaulle’s administration should be recognised as
the provisional government of France. Such
recognition nevertheless was delayed until
October 1944. The manner in which de Gaulle
had been treated by the ‘Anglo-Saxon’ powersmade the deepest impression on him and still ran-kled years later. The restoration of France to
great-power status, and its independence from
Anglo-American dominance, became almost an
obsession with de Gaulle in the post-war years.The war was clearly drawing to a close in theautumn of 1944. But stiff German resistance frus-
trated a quick victory. In the east, the Germans
continued to ﬁght ﬁercely. In the west, they were
even able to inﬂict temporary reverses on theAllies. Montgomery made a bold attempt inSeptember 1944 to cross the lower Rhine at
Arnhem with the help of parachute divisions
dropped in advance, but just short of Arnhem the
Germans were able to halt his thrust. The Allied
armies, however, were slowly pushing on to theRhine along a broad front and had reached prac-tically the whole length of the German frontier 
by mid-December. The Germans had still one
surprise left. Powerful German divisions, led by
tanks, together with what was left of theLuftwaffe in the west, opened an offensivethrough the Ardennes on 16 December 1944.
The Germans advanced sixty miles before they
were halted. It was their last offensive of the war.With the imminent collapse of Hitler’s Germany,agreement with the Russians on the military divi-sion of the territories the Allies would occupy,
and on the post-war delimitation of frontiers and
spheres of influence, took on a new urgency. 
In October 1944, Churchill flew to Moscow.Russian armies were by then already in Romaniaand Bulgaria and a British force was about to
enter Greece. Churchill in Moscow proposed to
Stalin a division of inﬂuence in the Balkan states.Stalin readily consented. But the resulting agree-ment was little more than a piece of paper. TheRed Army would dominate Romania, Bulgaria
and Hungary as it advanced towards greater
Germany. But Stalin allowed Britain freedom of
action in Greece, provided a broadly based gov-ernment including communists was formed inthat country. British troops who landed in Greece
soon found themselves ﬁghting the communist-
organised partisans. The uneasy peace established
by the British force was to be shattered two years
later in 1947 by civil war. Despite Stalin’s prom-ises to respect the sovereignty and the rights of self-determination of the nations of central
Europe and the Balkans, in his mind there was
always one overriding qualification: the free
choice of the people would be forcefully set asideif it led, as was likely, to anti-Soviet governments.Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia were able after
1945 to assert their independence from Soviet
control. The realities of Soviet ‘freedom’ were
already apparent before the war with Germany1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5291

Britain, the Soviet Union and the US, wasseverely tested by Soviet behaviour in 1944 and1945. He pinned his hopes on creating a new
international organisation – the United Nations –
under the tutelage and based on the agreement
of Britain, the Soviet Union and the US. But
Stalin was making unreasonable demands. Allsixteen Soviet republics were to be among thefounder members of the United Nations. He also
insisted that the six permanent members of the
proposed council of the United Nations should
be able to exercise an all-inclusive veto, that is tosay, have the right to a veto when disputes werebeing dealt with in which they themselves were
involved. The Dumbarton Oaks Conference,
which had met to organise the United Nations,
thus, ended in September 1944 without agree-ment on these vital issues. What was seen asStalin’s intransigence brought the US and Britain
more closely together.In Quebec, Churchill and Roosevelt met thatsame month, September 1944, to devise their
joint military and political strategy. Plans weremade to move troops from Italy into Istria andAustria ahead of Russian troops. To help Britain
economically, Roosevelt also agreed to continue
Lend-Lease during the time that would elapse
between the defeat of Germany and the defeat ofJapan. Britain’s likely post-war economic weak-ness was thus foreshadowed: Britain would not
remain an equal superpower with the US and the
Soviet Union. Britain and the US next agreed to
cooperate in the military and civilian development
of atomic energy and, signiﬁcantly, to exclude theSoviet Union from sharing this information.The future of Germany was another subject of primary importance discussed at Quebec.
Roosevelt’s advisers had prepared both a ‘soft’
plan for peace terms and the famous plan associ-ated with the name of the secretary of the trea-sury, Henry Morgenthau, which intended to
deprive Germany of its major industries, reduce
the German standard of living and turn it into anagricultural country. At ﬁrst Churchill was vio-lently opposed to this ‘hard’ option. It would tooclearly be repeating the error of the First World
War. A prosperous Europe could not develop
without German economic recovery. But in
return for concessions for the continuation ofAmerican economic aid to Britain he finallyassented to ‘converting Germany into a country
primarily agricultural and pastoral in its charac-
ter’. What were Roosevelt’s motives in advocat-
ing a course that would have been so disastrous
for European recovery? He spoke of punishingthe German people for their wars of aggression;more important to him was to win Stalin’s coop-
eration by reassuring the Soviet leader that the
Western Allies would not try to rebuild Germany
as a bulwark against Russia. In the autumn of1944 Roosevelt’s hand was strengthened by hisre-election as president. He would not have to
enter peace negotiations without the certainty of
public support as Wilson had done in 1919.At Yalta in February 1945 Stalin, Roosevelt andChurchill ﬁnally met together again for the ﬁrst
time since Teheran. Roosevelt and Churchill
arrived with some 700 ofﬁcials. The photograph
of the three leaders in front of the tsarist Livadia
Palace implied an equality that did not exist.Roosevelt as a head of state was seated in the cen-
tre ﬂanked on his left by Stalin and on his right by
Churchill. Roosevelt’s exhaustion and illness were
plain to see, a shocking transformation from the
conﬁdent president pictured only ﬁfteen monthsearlier at Teheran. He was in a hurry and wantedthe conference to be quickly over. He telegraphed
to Churchill that it ought not to last more than
five or six days. Churchill replied, ‘Even the
Almighty took seven.’ In the event it lasted eight
days from 4 to 11 February 1945.Roosevelt was determined to come to termswith the Soviet leader and saw in Churchill almost
as great an obstacle to establishing a good post-
war partnership between them as Stalin himself.
He had been reluctant to meet Churchill in Maltabefore ﬂying on to the Crimea for fear that UncleJoe would interpret this as the Anglo-Saxons
ganging up on him. The peaceful future of the
world rested, as Roosevelt saw it, on a good292THE SECOND WORLD WAR
Soviet–American understanding founded ontrust. He regarded Churchill’s ‘Victorian’ imperi-alism and his lifelong anti-communism as out-
dated in the post-war world.As for Churchill, he felt keenly on the eve ofGermany’s defeat that Europe was in danger fromthe overbearing, immensely powerful Russianbear. He was looking to a less rosy future than
Roosevelt was, in a world in which a United
Nations organisation could no more be relied
upon to preserve peace with justice than the
League of Nations had been. He wanted to dilutethe bilateral relationship between the US andRussia that Roosevelt was trying to establish.
Conscious of Britain’s comparative weakness,
Churchill tried to bring in another European ally,
France. He failed. De Gaulle was not invited andwould henceforth refer to the Yalta carve-up withbitterness and blame the ‘Anglo-Saxons’ for it.The only concession Churchill did win, ﬁnally
gaining Roosevelt’s support for it, was to secure 
for France participation on the Allied ControlCommission for Germany, which was to coordi-
nate Allied rule over the defeated Reich. France
would thus have its own occupation zone and its
own sector in Berlin. On reparations there was an
acceptance that the Soviet Union had a special
claim but the ﬁnal amount was left to a commis-
sion to propose. Perhaps the most signiﬁcant thing
about Yalta was what was not discussed and
agreed. The question of Germany’s future was
really shelved. Churchill and Roosevelt had moved
away from turning Germany into a ‘pastoral’ coun-
try. The dismemberment of Germany was not nowdetermined. The destitute plight of the Germans,
so Stalin may well have calculated, would strength-
en communism throughout Germany. To gain
material ends, he was ready to make promises that
would appear as major concessions. He agreed tomodify the Soviet stand on the organisation of theUnited Nations, whose success was closest to
Roosevelt’s heart. But Roosevelt had incautiously
told him that American troops would be with-

drawn from Europe within two years. Stalin there-
fore knew that he had only to wait until 1947; nomilitary threat would then be able to stop him
from doing whatever he then deemed to be in the
Soviet interest.The debate about Poland occupied much ofthe conference and was the most vexed. Historydid not have the same meaning for Churchill,
Roosevelt and Stalin. Stalin looked at the fron-
tiers of post-Versailles Europe through different
eyes. For the West, 1937 was the last year thatwas ‘normal’, when the political geography ofEurope reﬂected the peace settlements reached
after the First World War. After 1937, Hitler ﬁrst
blackmailed the West and then redrew the map
of Europe by force. For Russia, international
injustice pre-dated Hitler and had occurred afterit had lost the war in 1917. The settlement thenof the post-1918 Versailles era represented the
humiliating acceptance of the superior force of
the capitalist West at a time of Soviet weakness.From its own perspective, the Soviet Unionhad simply not in its infancy had the necessarystrength to regain Russia’s ‘just’ frontiers. And so
it had to acquiesce in the detaching of the Baltic
provinces, which became independent states –
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Large territorieswere also carved out of what was formerly imper-ial Russia to create the Polish state, which
included many Ukrainians and White Russians.
Bessarabia was detached and added to Romania.
As Stalin saw it, the frontiers of 1918–20 were
those imposed on Russia; they were neither ‘just’nor settled. He took advantage of the warbetween Germany, Poland, Britain and France in
1939–40 to put right what he believed were past
wrongs by first making deals with Hitler. By
1941, with the absorption of eastern Poland, thethree Baltic states and Bessarabia, Russia hadregained most of its ‘historic’ frontiers. Stalin
claimed that the Russian frontiers of 1941 should
be regarded as the settled ones and not those of
1921 or 1937; he was prepared to consider only
minor concessions. With remarkable consistency,he took his stand on this issue in discussions andnegotiations with his Western allies from the ear-
liest to the last months of the war.The Czechs in 1943 had arranged their ownsettlement over the frontiers and future govern-ment of their country. Benesˇ, head of the exiledgovernment in London, after the Munich experi-
ence of 1938 was not prepared to rely on Western
support again. He did not allow a confrontation1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5293
to develop between the communist-led MoscowCzechs and the London Western-oriented Czechsand accepted Soviet conditions and loss of terri-
tory. But the Poles in London had not made their
peace with Moscow. On the contrary, relations
between the Polish government in exile andMoscow were little short of outright hostility, andhad been aggravated by the establishment in
Lublin of a communist-dominated provisional
government.Beyond Russia’s frontiers the smaller nationsin an arc from the Baltic to the Balkans hadrecently acted, in Stalin’s view, as the springboardof aggression from the West against the Soviet
Union. He insisted to Roosevelt and Churchill
that they must not be allowed again to serve as
hostile bridges to the heart of Russia. Soviet secu-rity, he emphasised, would depend on guaranteesthat they would be ‘friendly’ to the Soviet Union
and would act in cooperation with it. What,
however, did ‘friendly’ mean? To Stalin it meant
that they could not remain capitalist, with anti-Russian governments based on the kind of societythat had existed before the war; only societies
transformed by a social revolution would be
‘friendly’ in the long term. The Western leaders
rejected this link between the social and economic
composition of the Soviet Union’s neighboursand its own security. They in turn insisted on freeelections, meaning that the people of the nations
in question should be allowed to choose the kind
of government and society they desired.The prospect of reconciling these oppositeviews was slight. From Stalin’s point of view theWest had no business to dictate the social and
political reconstruction of Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Romania, Bulgaria or Hungary, any more than he
himself wished to dictate the shape which the soci-

eties and politics of France, Italy, Belgium and theNetherlands should take. In these countries,Moscow had instructed the communist parties to
work constructively in coalitions dominated by
non-communists. He expected a quid pro quo.
The West saw the issue in simple terms of democ-
racy and self-determination.For the Polish government in London the rela-tionship with the Soviet Union was one of under-
standable enmity. The Russians had invadedPoland in September 1939 and now were annex-ing a large part of eastern Poland. The massgraves of 4,421 Polish ofﬁcers, shot in the back
of the head by the Russians, had been discovered
in 1943 in the forests of Katyn by German occu-
pying forces and exploited by Joseph Goebbelsfor Nazi propaganda purposes. This unforget-table atrocity tormented Polish–Soviet relations.
During the Second World War, Poland had been
the conquered nation which, with Russia, had
endured the most. Should it also become the
nation that would now be made to suffer the con-sequences of victory? Britain and the US agreedat Yalta to accept the Curzon Line, with some
deviations, as Poland’s eastern frontier, thus
giving a third of its pre-war territory to the Soviet
Union. This, the London Polish government felt,was a betrayal. Churchill and Roosevelt had beendriven to the reluctant conclusion that they had
no realistic alternative. The Red Army occupied
Poland and could not be forced to withdraw
unless the Anglo-American armies were preparedto ﬁght. Stalin for his part was well aware of thebitterness of the Polish government in London,
which constituted an obvious danger to the
Polish settlement he had in mind. The Poles were
traditionally anti-Russian. They would not be
allowed to assert their freedom at Russia’sexpense.The major tussle was over the western bound-ary of Poland. Stalin had promised the communist
Lublin government that the frontier would be
marked by the western Neisse. It was agreed thatPoland would receive Pomerania and the largerhalf of East Prussia. Churchill and Roosevelt held
out for the eastern Neisse, which would not have
assigned the whole of Silesia to Poland in addi-
tion. This question was left open to be settled
later. These territories were only to be ‘adminis-tered’ by Poland until the conclusion of a ﬁnalpeace treaty with Germany.Despite these calculations Stalin signed theDeclaration on Liberated Europe at Yalta. Ac-
cording to its provisions the Allies would act astrustees, reafﬁrming the principle of the AtlanticCharter – the right of all peoples to choose the
form of government under which they would live
– and ensuring the restoration of sovereign rights294THE SECOND WORLD WAR
and self-government to those peoples who hadbeen forcibly deprived of them by the aggressornations. Interim governments representing all
democratic elements were to be set up, followed
later by governments established ‘through free
elections’. This apparently unambiguous under-taking was ambiguous after all because it permit-ted only ‘democratic and anti-Nazi parties’ to put
up candidates. The Soviet Union twisted this to
suit its own purpose of securing communist-
dominated governments.Churchill and Roosevelt wanted more speciﬁcarrangements for Poland to ensure that the Lublinprovisional government, subservient to Moscow,
would be replaced by a broad coalition, including
exiled Polish leaders from the London-based gov-
ernment. The British and American ambassadorsin Moscow, together with the Soviet foreign min-ister Vyacheslav Molotov, were to facilitate nego-
tiations between the rival Polish governments in
Lublin and London. Once a uniﬁed provisional
government had been established, free electionswere to be held. The suspicious Stalin had agreedto this for the sake of Allied unity before the ﬁnal
defeat of Germany. As the Red Army was in occu-
pation of Poland he held all the cards and believed
that there were enough loopholes in the Yalta
agreement to ensure Soviet control in reality. Forthe Soviet Union an independent Poland in thepost-war world was likely to be a hostile Poland,
so its future was, for Stalin, a critical issue. Yalta
had only papered over the cracks between West
and East.One reason why Roosevelt had been concilia-tory in dealing with Stalin, frequently isolating
Churchill, was his anxiety to secure Soviet help
against the large Japanese armies deployed in
China and in the Japanese home islands. The
future of the atom bomb was still in doubt.Roosevelt told Stalin nothing about the progressthat had been made. Actually, through agents,
Stalin was already well informed. But it still
appeared likely in February 1945 that the defeat
of Japan would require bitter ﬁghting, culminat-ing in the invasion of mainland Japan, fanaticallydefended by the Japanese. Stalin at Yalta agreed
to the Soviet Union’s entry into the Paciﬁc war
two or three months after the defeat of Germany,but he named his price. With American lives atstake, Roosevelt did not allow anti-imperialistsentiments to stand in the way. Stalin demanded
that Japan should relinquish southern Sakhalin
and the Kurile Islands and that China should
concede the warm-water port of Dairen and useof the Manchurian railway. The former imperialrights that tsarist Russia had enjoyed in China
before 1904 were to be restored to the Soviet
Union. The Chinese were not consulted, though
in one part of their secret agreement it was stated
that Chiang Kai-shek’s consent was to be secured;but elsewhere, inconsistently, another paragraphwas included: ‘The Heads of the three Great
Powers have agreed that these claims of the Soviet
Union shall be unquestionably fulfilled after
Japan has been defeated.’ Stalin also promised tosupport efforts to bring about the cooperation of the Chinese Nationalists and the communists.
For him this had the advantage of preventing 
the far more numerous Nationalists from simply
attempting to wipe out the communists once thewar with Japan was over.Although Roosevelt had conceded Soviet pre-dominance in Manchuria, he believed he had
done his best to strengthen the post-war position
of a weak China and that he had reduced the risk
of civil war. The actual consequences of hisdiplomacy turned out differently and Harry S.Truman, his successor, did not welcome the last-
minute Soviet declaration of war on Japan.
Roosevelt in public spoke of Yalta as a triumph
and a new beginning that would see the replac-ing of alliances and spheres of inﬂuence by thenew international organisation of the United
Nations. In private he was far more doubtful
whether Stalin would fulﬁl what he had promised.
But the war against Japan was still to be won and
in the new year of 1945 he would contemplateno confrontation with the Soviet Union inEastern or central Europe. Cooperation with
Russia was possible, he believed, but he was at
one with Churchill in concluding that ﬁrmness 
in dealing with Stalin was equally necessary.Roosevelt was not duped by Stalin but he couldsee no peaceful future unless coexistence could
somehow be made to work. It was best to express
conﬁdence rather than misgivings.1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5295
Churchill’s conscience was troubled by theYalta agreement, which had once again partitioneda brave wartime ally, Poland. The shadow of
appeasement, of Munich and Czechoslovakia lay
not far behind and there was discontent in the
House of Commons where a hard core of voteswere cast against what had been concluded atYalta. Poland was potentially damaging politically,
a sensitive spot for Churchill at home. Inter-

nationally that spring of 1945, with the defeat of
Germany in sight, his apprehensions also grew, as
he contemplated a prostrate Western Europe andBritain being left to face the Soviets alone. TheAmericans, he feared, would withdraw to concen-

trate on the war in the Paciﬁc. At Yalta, he had not

been able to inﬂuence the outcome as the third
and equal partner, because Roosevelt and Stalinhad negotiated directly with each other. TheSoviets had secretly agreed to help defeat Japan so
it was tempting, especially for the Americans, to
appease the Soviet Union in Europe. In the war
theatre, General Eisenhower also appeared tootrusting of the Russians, ready to concert militarystrategy with his Soviet counterparts, rather than
to occupy as much of northern Germany as could
be captured and then to drive on to Berlin, as
Churchill urged in March 1945.Stalin meanwhile was accusing the West ofsecretly arranging for the German armies to stopﬁghting on the western front while they contin-
ued to resist the Russians ferociously all along the
eastern battle zones. This was indeed partially
true. The German forces were disintegrating inthe West, with many soldiers deserting. Cities andtowns surrendered to Anglo-American forces, dis-
obeying Hitler’s senseless orders to ﬁght to the
last, and the German high command would have
liked to reach a separate military surrender in the
West. This was rejected. This did not mean thatChurchill was complacent about the threat he discerned from the Soviet advance deep into
Western Europe.Churchill kept up a barrage of warnings intelegrams to Roosevelt. He urged that Stalin be treated firmly and made to adhere to the Yalta engagements. Churchill cabled Roosevelt,
‘Poland has lost her frontier. Is she now to lose
her freedom?’ For Roosevelt, too, the Poles werea sensitive domestic political issue: there were 6million Americans of Polish descent in the US.But at the time he was anxious to secure Soviet
cooperation to found the United Nations. He was
therefore inclined to more conciliatory tactics to
avoid alienating Stalin and so jeopardising hisvision of a new world order. He also wanted tomake sure of the promised Soviet help against
Japan. Nevertheless, he joined Churchill in ﬁrm
appeals to Stalin.On 12 April 1945 Roosevelt suffered a strokeso severe that he died shortly afterwards. He hadresponded with a growing sense of urgency to the threat posed by the totalitarian states. He
recognised that freedom and democracy were
being endangered throughout the world. His
‘Quarantine’ speech in 1937 had marked animportant stage in his realisation that domesticproblems at home would have to take second
place to world problems. Working within the
context of an overwhelming isolationist senti-
ment, Roosevelt had provided the indispensable,if at times devious, leadership which placed on theAmerican people the burden of accepting the role
of the US as a superpower. In his post-war plans
he worked for Soviet–American understanding,
and for the creation of a viable United Nations
organisation. He placed the US on the side ofindependence for the peoples of Asia, includ-ing the dismantling of the European empires. 
He pinned his hopes on China achieving unity
and stability. In Western Europe he was ready 
to provide American support to bring about arecovery that would enable these liberatednations, together with Britain, to safeguard their
own freedoms. But he was under no illusions that
all this had already actually been achieved. The
behaviour of Stalin’s Russia filled him with
anxiety, yet it was an anxiety not without hopefor the future. For all his limitations, Roosevelt’scontribution to the reorientation of America’s
vision of its responsibilities in the world was all
important. The news of his death came as a shock
to the world. A half-crazed Hitler buried in hisBerlin bunker saw it as the miracle that might savehis Reich from defeat. By then the ﬁnal offensives
in the east and west were striking into the heart
of Germany.296THE SECOND WORLD WAR
In March 1945 the American and Britisharmies crossed the Rhine. During April theypassed well beyond the military demarcation
zones agreed at Yalta. Suspicion of Russian inten-
tions was high and Churchill urged that the
Anglo-American forces should withdraw onlywhen the Russians had fulﬁlled their undertak-ings. It had been agreed that Berlin, although
deep within the Russian zone of Germany, should
be occupied jointly by the US, Britain and theSoviet Union, as well as France. But would theSoviets, once they had taken Berlin, honour theirobligations?The ﬁnal Soviet offensives began in January1945. Hitler ordered fanatical resistance on all
fronts and the adoption of a ‘scorched earth’ pol-
icy. If Germany were not victorious, he concluded,the German people had not proved themselves
worthy of the ideals of the Aryan race. He thus
condemned Germany to senseless destruction.1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5297

The occupation zones of Germany and Austria, 1945With Goebbels and Bormann at his side, he issuedstreams of orders from his underground headquar-
ters in Berlin. But his orders were no longer
unquestioningly obeyed. Armaments Minister
Albert Speer attempted to prevent Germany’s
industry from being totally destroyed. He waslooking beyond Hitler and defeat to Germany’srecovery. Himmler tried to save his neck by seek-

ing to negotiate an end to the war. Göring, who
was in southern Germany, fancied himself as
Hitler’s successor, but an angry Hitler ordered the
ﬁeld marshal’s arrest. The Reich ended in intrigue,ruins, bloodshed and shabby farce. Hitler con-
cluded his life marrying his mistress, and on 30
April they both committed suicide. Goebbels and
his wife then killed themselves with all their chil-

dren. On 2 May Berlin surrendered to Soviettroops. Despite Germany’s rapid disintegration,Admiral Karl Dönitz, nominated by Hitler as new
leader of the Reich, took over as head of state,
observing legal niceties. He even formed a new
‘government’. It lasted but a few days. On 7 MayGermany unconditionally surrendered on allfronts. Britain and the US now confronted the
Soviet Union amid the ruins of continental
Europe. Thus began a new era of international
realities and conﬂict.
The sudden death of Roosevelt was a great blowfor Churchill. While the prime minister’s inﬂu-
ence over the peace settlements had diminished,
his special relationship with Roosevelt, an old
friendship and appeals to past loyalties stillcounted for something. But would the new inex-perienced president listen to the advice of the
elder statesman, as Churchill now directed his
warnings about Russia to Truman? He sent a
cable to Truman expressing his foreboding that
an ‘iron curtain is being drawn down on theirfront’, his ﬁrst use of this phrase, which was tobecome famous later when he uttered it in public
at Fulton in March 1946. He wanted Truman to
come to London to coordinate a showdown with
Stalin at a new conference. Truman rejected theidea as signalling to Stalin that the Anglo-Americans were ganging up against him.Churchill further urged Truman to delayimplementing the agreements reached on therespective occupation zones of Germany and notto withdraw the Allied forces which held territorydeep in the zone assigned to the Soviet Union. It
would be a bargaining counter and at least force
the Russians to relinquish control over the whole
of Berlin. But Truman was his own man. He was
not enamoured of the Russians, to put it mildly,
yet he was determined to honour previous agree-
ments, so that he could hold Stalin, so he
thought, to what the Russians had undertaken. If
Churchill had prevailed, the Cold War would
have begun earlier, more of Germany would have
been kept out of the Soviet sphere, and the West
would not have become entangled in Berlin;
alternatively, Stalin would have had to give wayin central Europe. But a major difﬁculty of stand-ing up to the Russians at this early date was public
opinion in the West, where an unbounded admi-
ration was felt for the Red Army, which had
played the major role on land in the defeat of the
Wehrmacht.Far from coordinating policy with Churchill,Truman sought a direct Soviet–American under-
standing on all the issues not settled at Yalta, to
which end he sent Harry Hopkins to Moscow in
May 1945. Churchill was upset by this move,
which left Britain out in the cold. He was anxious
to secure settlements with the Soviet Union con-
cerning frontiers and spheres of inﬂuence beforethe British and American armies on the continenthad been demobilised, for he feared that if such
settlements were delayed the Russians would be
able to do what they wanted. Truman and his
advisers were more anxious to establish the
United Nations as an institution that would
ensure peace and solve all future world problems.
It was a case of realism versus idealism.The conference to negotiate the UnitedNations Charter convened in San Francisco on 25
April 1945. The Americans feared that the UN
would be stillborn unless Russian cooperation
could be won. The problem of how the veto
would operate on the Security Council had notﬁnally been settled at Yalta, and Molotov’s widen-ing of its application was creating difﬁculties. It
was common ground that the five permanent
members – the US, the Soviet Union, Britain,298THE SECOND WORLD WAR
France and China – could veto any action; thedispute was about whether the veto also appliedto a discussion, an examination or a recommen-
dation concerning an issue brought before the
Security Council. If it did, any one of the per-
manent members could stop a dispute from even
being considered. The Russian attitude, however,
was understandable given that the West looked
like enjoying a permanent majority in the General
Assembly. In addition the question of whether
any government could represent Poland raised
the unsolved Polish question once more.It was to straighten out these and other dif-ferences that Truman sent Hopkins to Moscow in
May. At their meetings, Stalin cleverly tried todrive a wedge between the US and Britain, whileHopkins listened sympathetically. Stalin certainly
got the better of the bargain. His concession that
the Polish government would be widened by the
admission of some of the London Polish leaders
still left the communists in a dominant position.
Hopkins meanwhile accepted as sincere Stalin’s
promise not to interfere in Polish affairs, especially
during the holding of ‘free elections’, and to
show respect for individual rights and liberties.
Yet when Stalin refused to release Poles he had
arrested for what he described as ‘diversionist’
activities, the reality behind the words became
only too clear. Hopkins was also anxious to gainconﬁrmation of the secret agreement concerningthe Far East reached at Yalta. Stalin promised to
attack the Japanese on 8 August 1945 and to
respect Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria. On the
veto issue which was blocking progress on the
UN Charter, Stalin made genuine concessions
and the ﬁnal agreements reached in San Francisco
represented a complicated compromise of the
American and Soviet view. It made possible the
completion of negotiations for the Charter on 25
June 1945.Hopkins returned from his mission in earlyJune, with the way now clear for the summit
meeting in Potsdam. Truman’s idea that heshould meet Stalin alone before being joined bythe British prime minister was angrily rejected by
Churchill, who was adamant that he was not ‘pre-
pared to attend a meeting which was a continua-tion of a conference between yourself andMarshal Stalin’. He insisted on a simultaneousmeeting on equal terms.The Potsdam Conference was the ﬁnal confer-ence, and the longest, of the Grand Alliance. It
lasted from 17 July to 2 August 1945, forming abridge between the world at war and the comingpeace. Churchill had hoped Britain would recap-
ture its lost inﬂuence, that the inexperienced new
president would listen to the elder statesman. De
Gaulle was again snubbed; although France was
to become a member of the Control Commissionfor Germany, French representatives were notinvited to join in discussions over Germany.
Agreement was reached on many post-war issues,
especially the Allied treatment of Germany, but
suspicion between the Allies had grown. The mil-itary necessity of holding together was gone. Therelationship between East and West lacked trust
and, in the personal contact between the big
three, Churchill, later Clement Attlee, Truman
and Stalin, the old sense of comradeship was
lacking. Despite the rounds of dinners and recep-tions, there was a palpable absence of warmth.Averell Harriman, US ambassador in Moscow,
tried to make a friendly remark to Stalin at
Potsdam: ‘Marshal, you must be very proud now
to be in Berlin.’ He received the rather discon-certing reply, ‘Tsar Alexander got to Paris’.Distrust was to widen as the agreements reached
at Potsdam were broken. The West accused the
Soviet Union of bad faith; this made little impres-
sion on Stalin, who faced the enormous task of
rebuilding the Soviet Union and tightening thedictatorial reins once more so that his regimewould survive the capitalist external threat which
he perceived.Stalin did not trust the West and the West didnot trust him. That was very clearly shown by thefact that Britain and the US had been buildingthe atomic bomb in great secrecy, without sharing
their knowledge with their Soviet ally during 
the war. The Russians, too, had been secretly
engaged on making a bomb, but the Americansgot there ﬁrst. After hearing that an experimen-tal bomb had been successfully tested in New
Mexico on 16 July, Truman obliquely referred to1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5299
this success in talking to Stalin, without speciﬁc-ally mentioning that an atomic bomb would soon
be dropped on Hiroshima. Stalin did not betray
his anxiety that the US had tilted the balance of
power in its favour. Churchill was elated. Theatomic bomb would redress the balance: despitethe strength of the Red Army, Stalin no longer
had all the cards in his hands. After Stalin had
returned to the Kremlin, he ordered Soviet
scientists to redouble their efforts to make a
Soviet atomic bomb. Now that the world knew itcould be done, the basic obstacles were moreindustrial than scientiﬁc, the difﬁculty of extract-
ing the ﬁssionable materials. Klaus Fuchs helped
the Soviet scientists to reach their goal in 
1949, but they would no doubt have solved theproblems, without him, albeit later.On the whole Stalin could be well satisﬁedwith the outcome of the conference at Potsdam.
Churchill did not stay to the end. He returned to
be in London when the outcome of the general
election was announced. He was replaced on 28July in Potsdam by Clement Attlee and theredoubtable Ernest Bevin, the new foreign secretary, who in the last days of the conference
conducted most of the negotiations for Britain.
Truman also left most of the critical bargaining
to his secretary of state James Byrnes. The Polishissue once more proved highly contentious. Therewas much argument about Poland’s western fron-
tier. To the end Stalin insisted on the western
Neisse, facing the West with a fait accompli. Bevin
and Byrnes had to accept this but did so with the
proviso that these German territories were only tobe ‘administered’ by Poland and a ﬁnal settlementof the western frontier would have to await the
signature of the peace treaty with Germany. In
fact, the provisional was to prove permanent.The Polish agreement was part of a dealwhereby the Soviet Union reluctantly acceptedthe American proposal on reparations. From a
reparations point of view, Stalin had wanted to
have Germany treated as a whole so that he could
participate in spoils from the West and the indus-
trial Ruhr as well as take away all that could bemoved from the Soviet zone. But he had to be sat-300THE SECOND WORLD WAR

to be met from the Soviet share. In addition, the
Soviet Union would receive 10 per cent of indus-
trial capital equipment taken as reparations by theWest and a further 15 per cent in exchange forfood and raw materials from the east. The agree-
ment soon led to bitter recriminations.Stalin did better on the question of the recon-stituted Polish government. The London Poles
were pressurised into accepting a settlement thatincorporated some London ministers in the communist-dominated government in Warsaw.
Poland would not emerge again from communist
rule and Soviet domination for two generations.The redrawing of Poland’s frontiers only rati-ﬁed what had already happened on the humanlevel. Millions of Poles moved west to the Polish
side of the Curzon Line. Millions of Germans,
too, had ﬂed westward from the Red Army and
the Polish forces, as well as from the German territories now under Polish rule and from theSudeten areas of Czechoslovakia. Young and old
were driven out with only the possessions they
could carry. The Russians, Poles and Czechs, after
the way they had been treated under Nazi occu-
pation, were now indifferent to the suffering ofthe Germans. Retribution fell on guilty and inno-cent alike and many Germans perished from the
hardships of migration. When, at Potsdam, the
Allies recorded their agreement that the ‘transfer’
of Germans from Poland, Czechoslovakia andHungary should be carried out ‘in an orderly andhumane manner’, the West was therefore doing
no more than expressing a pious hope largely after
the event.A central issue at Potsdam was the need toreach agreement on the treatment of Germany.The idea of dividing Germany into a number ofseparate states was ﬁnally abandoned. But the
principles on which control of Germany were
based were contradictory from the start: the Allies
sought to treat Germany as one while at the sametime partitioning it into zones of occupation. TheAllied Control Council was supposed to oversee
Germany as a whole, but each of the commanders-
in-chief in his own zone had complete authority as well. The plan to establish ‘central Germanadministrative departments, headed by StateSecretaries ... in the ﬁelds of ﬁnance, transport,

communications, foreign trade and industry’, 
but under the direction of the Control Council,
proved impossible to carry through as long as each occupation zone fell under the separate control of one of the four Allies. There was to be
‘for the time being’ no central German govern-
ment, but local self-government and democratic
parties were encouraged. On the one hand, the
Allies agreed that during the occupation ‘theGerman economy shall be treated as a single eco-nomic unit’; on the other, reparations were a mat-
ter for each occupying power to settle in its own
zone.In practice, the immediate consequence of allthese decisions was to move towards the divisionof Germany into four separate zones. Four years
later, the three Western zones would combine
and create a democratic Western central govern-
ment, and a communist regime would beimposed on the Soviet Eastern zone. There weresome areas of agreement, however; the trial of war
criminals, the destruction of Nazi ideology, the
complete disarmament of Germany, and control
of such German industry as could be used for war,
led to no real differences at Potsdam. But alreadythe West and the Russians were compromisingthese principles. German scientists were too valu-
able a ‘war booty’ to be punished as Nazi war
criminals. Rocket scientists who had perfected the
V-1 and V-2 in Peenemünde were, despite theirpast, seized by the Americans and bribed to con-tribute their know-how to Western military tech-
nology. Many who should have been convicted of
war crimes prospered instead in the West and
worked for the US in the space race. Other
German rocket scientists were captured by theRussians and assisted in Soviet missile develop-ment. In the Cold War, ex-Nazis with expertise
in military intelligence were recruited by both
sides. Former Wehrmacht officers served both
NATO and the Warsaw Pact armies. These weresome of the darker aspects of what happened inthe aftermath of the victory over Germany.Austria was separated once more fromGermany and was fortunate to escape reparations.1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5301

Europe after 1945Austrian guards in concentration camps had notbehaved with any less bestiality in the SS thantheir German counterparts, nor can a distinction
be drawn between Austrian and German mem-
bers of the Wehrmacht. Austria was allowed to
establish a central government but was occupied,like Germany, and divided into four zones,American, British, French and Soviet, with
Vienna under joint control.The Potsdam Conference established aCouncil of Foreign Ministers which, it was
expected, would normally meet in London. Itsmain task was the preparation of peace treatieswith Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and
Finland. A peace settlement with Germany was
also mentioned, but it seemed a distant prospect
in 1945 since it required the prior establishmentof a German government with the consent of theAllies. Only those countries that were signatories
to the terms of surrender of each state would be
allowed to participate, with the exception of
France, which was admitted to discuss peaceterms with Italy. During the eighteen months ofits existence and after much acrimony, peace
treaties with all these states except Germany were
agreed. The Council, which still represented the
wartime alliance, came to grief over the German
question, and the Cold War began.Potsdam marked the beginning of the end ofany hope that the wartime alliance would outlast
the defeat of Germany, Italy, Japan and the minor
Axis allies and, as Roosevelt had hoped, continue
to safeguard the peace. It had achieved victoryover the most powerful and barbaric threat everfaced by Russia and the Western democracies in
modern times. The year 1945 marks a division in
world history. This side of it the West once more
perceived the Soviet Union as its most dangerous
enemy. But this division should not obscure whatlies on the other side, what the civilised worldowes to the sacriﬁces made by the Soviet Union,
by China, by Britain and by the US, the great
powers of their day which saw the struggle
through together.No one expected that the Japanese would beforced to surrender within three months of the
Allied victory in Europe. In ﬁghting as savage asany in the Second World War, the US navy, themarines and the army, under the command ofAdmiral Nimitz, had pushed the Japanese back
from one tropical island base to the next. By the
summer of 1943 the Japanese had been forced on
to the defensive. A year later the Americans wereclosing in on Japan, capturing Saipan, Tinian andGuam. Meanwhile a Japanese offensive from
Burma into India was halted by British and
Dominion troops. In October 1944 General
MacArthur began the attack on the Philippines.
There ensued the last great naval engagement ofthe Second World War – the battle of Leyte Gulf.The Japanese navy had planned a counterblow to
destroy MacArthur’s supply line and then his
army. With the defeat of the Japanese navy in
Leyte Gulf the US had won command of the seain Japan’s home waters.In the central Paciﬁc, Nimitz advanced fromSaipan to the island of Iwojima and then in the
ﬁercest ﬁghting of the war, lasting from April to
June 1945, attacked and captured Okinawa, anisland in the Ryukyu group just 500 miles fromJapan. Japan’s cities were being systematically
reduced to rubble by the ﬁres caused by constant
air attacks. In south-east Asia, Admiral Lord
Louis Mountbatten commanded the Allied forces
which between December 1944 and May 1945recaptured Burma from the retreating Japanese.But, skilfully as this campaign was conducted, it
was secondary in its impact on the war. The
Americans in the Paciﬁc were thrusting at the
heart of the Japanese Empire.In 1944 the Japanese military and naval leadersknew the war could not be won. Yet even as late
as May 1945 they hoped that the evidence of
Japan’s fanatical defence at Okinawa and else-
where would deter the Allies from invading Japan
itself, where the Allies, for the ﬁrst time, wouldhave to come to grips with large Japanese armies.Rather than lose thousands of men, might not the
Allies be prepared to offer reasonable terms?Those advisers of the emperor who were infavour of an immediate peace were not strongenough to assert themselves openly against themilitary and naval leaderships. But war supplies,
especially oil, were rapidly running out and
Japan’s situation was deteriorating fast. By July1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5303
1945 even the military accepted that it was worthtaking the initiative to explore what kind of peaceterms the Allies might put forward. Approaches
were made to the Soviet Union to act as media-
tors. The Soviets refused brusquely to help 
Japan to a negotiated peace. With the prize ofManchuria promised at Yalta, Stalin had his ownreasons for wishing to prolong the war long
enough to enable the Red Army to advance into
Manchuria. Nevertheless, Stalin did inform
Churchill of Japanese overtures when they assem-
bled with Truman at the Potsdam Conference inJuly 1945, urging that the Allies should insist on‘unconditional’ surrender.But Churchill pressed moderation on Trumanto save American and British lives. The upshot
was that Truman and Churchill on 26 July issuedan ultimatum to Japan setting out basic condi-tions of peace. They called for the unconditional
surrender of the Japanese military forces. The
inﬂuence of the military and all those who had
guided Japan, into the path of aggression wouldbe removed. War criminals would be punishedand reparations required. Japan would have to
give up all its imperial conquests. Finally, Japan
would be occupied. But, beyond this, the decla-
ration went out of its way to promise Japan a
future: ‘We do not intend that the Japanese shallbe enslaved as a race nor destroyed as a nation.’Japan’s industries would be preserved, its soldiers
allowed to return home, and democracy and
justice would be established under the guidance
of the occupation. Once this was securely rootedin Japan, and a freely elected Japanese govern-ment could safely be given responsibility, the
occupation forces would withdraw. In short,
imperial Japan with its divine emperor would be
transformed into a Western-type democratic state.
What was not clear, and it was a critical point forthe Japanese, was whether the emperor would bepermitted to remain on the throne.Japan’s 80-year-old prime minister, AdmiralSuzuki, responded to the ultimatum with a non-
committal statement. He was temporising in theface of the powerful military opposition; mis-translation unfortunately made his reply sound
contemptuous. But was it really necessary to drop
the atomic bomb or would a few more days havegiven the upper hand to the peace party in anycase? The evidence suggests that only afterHiroshima – realising what terrible havoc would
result from more such bombs – did Emperor
Hirohito conclude that he could no longer merely
accept the decision of his leading ministers andthe military, but that he would have to asserthimself and overrule the military who still were
inclined to continue the war. Ironically it was the
last act of the emperor’s divine authority, soon to
be destroyed, that saved countless American and
Japanese lives. President Truman was thereforeright in believing that only the atomic bombscould shock Japan into immediatesurrender.On 6 August an American plane dropped justone small bomb on a Japanese city still untouched
by war. ‘Hiroshima’ henceforth has become abyword for a nuclear holocaust, for a threatenednew world. There was instant recognition that the
nature of war had been transformed. Scientists
had harnessed the innermost forces of nature to
a weapon of destruction that had hitherto beenunimaginable. In one blinding ﬂash the humanswho were instantly vaporised were perhaps the
more fortunate; 66,000 men, women and chil-
dren were killed immediately or succumbed soon
after the atom bomb had struck. Another 69,000
were horribly injured – they were found to sufferfrom a new illness, radiation sickness, and manydied later in agony. Even future unborn genera-
tions were affected, deformed by the mutation of
genes in the sick. The suffering has continued for
decades. Four square miles of the city were totallydestroyed on that terrible day. Three days laterNagasaki was the second and mercifully last city
to suffer the effects of an atomic attack. It was
not the end, however, of the development of even
more destructive nuclear weapons of annihilation.
The single Hiroshima bomb possessed the explo-sive power of 20,000 tons of TNT. Later hydro-gen bombs were tested in the 1950s with a power
many times greater than the bomb dropped on
Hiroshima. There was and is no effective system
of defence in existence that can stop the missiledelivery of a destructive power that can wipe outcivilised life on whole continents. The Japanese
were the ﬁrst victims and the last, if the world is
to survive.304THE SECOND WORLD WAR
Ever since the horror of Hiroshima the debatehas raged whether a weapon so indiscriminate inits mass destruction of human life should have
been used. It has been argued that the main
reason why it was dropped was to warn the 
Soviet Union of the new invincible power of the US. No doubt the possession of the atomicbomb made it possible for the US to feel that it
was safe to demobilise even in the face of the
superior weight of the Soviet armed forces. But
the bomb would have been dropped even had the
Soviet Union not existed. The investment in the construction of the two nuclear bombs avail-able for use in 1945 had been huge. It was
thought that using them would prove decisive in
ending the war without more ﬁghting and the
expected further losses of Allied lives from storm-ing the Japanese home islands against ﬁerce resis-tance. The killing of enemy civilians in order to
shorten the war was seen as justiﬁed after so muchdeath and destruction. No one thought in termsof drawing up a balance sheet of losses of enemymen, women and children as against the lives of
Allied soldiers. That is shown by the devastating
raids on German and Japanese cities with con-
ventional weapons. Loss of civilian lives wasgreater in Tokyo and Dresden than in Hiroshimaand Nagasaki.The Soviet Union’s declaration of war onJapan on 8 August and its invasion of China were
fresh disasters but not decisive factors in forcing
Tokyo’s leader to make a decision. Messages sentby the Allies and received in Tokyo on 13 August1945 indicating that the emperor would not be
removed from the throne were more important in
the ﬁnal deliberations. On 14 August the emperor
broadcast Japan’s surrender. Over the radio hespoke for the ﬁrst time to the Japanese people,saying that the unendurable had to be endured.
The Second World War was over.1THE VICTORY OF THE ALLIES, 1941–5305

POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
In May 1945 a world seemed to have come to anend in Germany. So cataclysmic was the change
that the Germans coined the phrase ‘zero hour’.
Their country was occupied and at the mercy offoreigners, who now took over the government.The victors’ ideologies and values were imposed
on the new Germany for good or ill; but nothing
could be worse than what had gone before.In the western zones of Germany, constitutingtwo-thirds of the former Reich, the social basis didnot radically alter. Factory owners, managers ofindustry, and the professional classes, despite their
involvement with Hitler’s Germany, adjusted
themselves to the new circumstances. Only the
best-known collaborators, such as Alfried Krupp,were arrested and tried. Expertise and efﬁciencydoes not have to coincide with morality. Defeated
Germany did not lose the skills of its managers,
engineers and workers, who thus made possible
the later economic miracle of the 1950s. During
the early years of the occupation from 1945 to1949 their ﬁrst task was to try to resist or circum-vent and soften the draconian economic directives
of occupiers bent on de-industrialising Germany.In 1945, the Allies were amazed to discoverhow much of Germany’s industrial strength hadsurvived the war. The lost production of the steelindustry did not exceed 10 per cent, and no key
industry had suffered more than 20 per cent
losses. Industrially, then, 1945 was not the zero
hour, despite the huge problems of restoringsome sort of normality.The physical appearance of the German citiesbelied their underlying strength. Corpses still 
lay under huge mounds of rubble, and thou-
sands were to remain entombed there. The new Germany would have to be built on top of streets turned into cemeteries. Parts of Berlin, 
Cologne and Hamburg were totally ﬂattened. In
Hamburg, one district had even been walled in.
No one had been permitted to enter it for fear
that disease would spread from the corpses leftthere.The last weeks of the war, although it was lostfor certain, had added to the needless destruction
of life. The Germans had fought on, obeying
orders. Some even believed that the Führer had awonder-weapon that would rescue them or thatthe Americans and British would join them to
ﬁght the Russians ‘to save civilisation’. There was
also a good reason for holding on as long as pos-
sible in the east. The surviving German navy made
it a last mission to evacuate the refugees strandedon the coast of East Prussia and now cut off fromthe rest of Germany by the Soviet advance. Tens
of thousands were ferried to Hamburg and other
ports in west Germany. Jewish survivors, however,
were murdered on East Prussia’s beaches. Germanlosses during the war had been horrendous. Morethan 3 million German soldiers had been killed or
were missing, millions more were wounded and
disabled; the Western Allied camps were ﬁlled
with prisoners of war. Those in Soviet captivitywho survived would not return home for ten1Chapter 26ZERO HOURTHE ALLIES AND THE GERMANSyears. More than half a million civilians killed werevictims of the Allied bombing offensive.Allied soldiers commandeered the more habit-able buildings; military headquarters were set up;
local administrative offices were supervised by
Russian, British, French or American army ofﬁ-cers. The war had displaced millions. German sol-diers and civilians were trying to ﬁnd their way
home. Poles and Russians brought to Germany as
slave labour were now stranded; there were also
tens of thousands of Russians who had changed
sides and had sought to escape death by helpingthe Germans. Some Ukrainians and Latvians,Lithuanians and Estonians had participated with
the SS in terrible atrocities. Victims and murder-
ers were now all intermingled.The concentration-

camp survivors were released. Millions of ‘for-eigners’ were on German soil; many were sick andunable to work – what was to happen to them?
What was to be done with the pitiful remnants of
the European Jews? A new and prosaic term was
found for this ﬂotsam of humanity, ‘displaced
persons’. They were put in camps again, in simplehuts, and were fed by relief workers. It was to take
years to sort them all out and settle them – not
always in the country of their choice.More than 20 million were on the move inEurope in the early summer of 1945, escapingsomething, going from somewhere to somewhere
else. The roads were crammed with people on
foot, on bicycles and with bundles of possessions.
Some arrived crowded into or clinging to theoutside of the few trains that were still running.The sheer scale of the forced migration during the
war and in 1945, continuing for another two and
three years, almost deﬁes the imagination. From
mid-1944 Germans and their allies were ﬂeeing
from the advancing Red Army in the east, wherethe Wehrmacht tried to hold a front line evenduring the last days of the war to enable mil-
lions more to reach the west. The loss of life
probably exceeded 2 million, as the ﬁghting at
times overran the ﬂeeing civilian columns. NaziGermans who had lorded it over the Polesdeserved their fate but not the children. Tragedy
overtook both the guilty and the innocent.When the war was over, under the terms of thePotsdam Agreement the Poles drove out most ofthe Germans who had settled in Poland duringthe war, as well as the ethnic Germans who had
lived in Poland long before it became a sovereign
state again; millions more were driven from the310POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7

Czechoslovakia, the Sudeten ethnic Germans
were likewise expelled. It was supposed to be
done humanely, but pent-up hatreds often gotthe better of humanity. In all, as many as 10million Germans and ethnic Germans reached the
Western zones of Germany without much more
than the clothes they stood up in. At least they
were ‘home’ with their own people, though not
always welcomed by the local residents. Theywere not displaced persons (DPs for short) as the1.5 million Russians, the million French citizens,
the 600,000 Poles and the hundreds of thousands
from every country the Germans had conquered,
whose people had been forced to work in Germanfactories were. Some had a home to go to; others,including many Russians, did not want to return
– they knew what fate awaited them for collabor-
ating with the Germans. The British, in accor-
dance with agreements made with the Russiansand Yugoslavs, forced thousands back at the pointof the bayonet. Among the most pathetic DPs,
were the Jews, the survivors of the death camps,
who longed to enter British-controlled Palestine.Rations for the Germans were very short, suf-ﬁcient only to maintain life. Coal was lacking forheating and for industry. Hardly a tree that couldprovide fuel for a ﬁre was left standing in the
towns. The lovely Berlin park, the Tiergarten, was
soon denuded of its trees. The destruction of the
transport system made it even harder to providebasic needs for an estimated 25 million homelessand rootless people, as well as for the rest of the
population. Many families had lost their bread-
winner at the front, ‘fallen for Führer and
country’; many more men, women and children
were crippled by war wounds. The immediatechallenge in 1945 was mere survival. Curfews andthe lack of postal and telephone systems cut off
one community from another during the early
weeks of peace; in Kassel the population did not
know what was happening in Frankfurt. OnlyGerman farmers, in the countryside, were still rel-atively well off. They had their houses, their land,
and ﬂour, milk, vegetables and meat which they
could exchange for a Persian carpet or jewellerybrought to them by hungry city-dwellers. Therewas little fellow feeling in misfortune. Allied 
soldiers, too, swapped necessities and cigarettes
for expensive cameras and watches. Cigarettes
became a currency.That mass starvation and epidemics did notsweep through Germany and central Europe in
1945 and 1946 is a remarkable tribute to the
relief workers. It was also due to the efﬁciency of
new pesticides: there was no repeat of theinfluenza epidemic that claimed millions ofvictims after the First World War; lice, the main
carriers of disease, were killed by DDT. Much of
the management of these huge tasks was
entrusted to young inexperienced Allied ofﬁcers.
The Germans acted under their direction.Contemporary observers remarked on theapathy and listlessness of the German population.
In the towns only the bare rations to keep people
alive could be distributed, and the ﬁrst winter of
peace, one of the coldest on record, claimed manyvictims among the elderly and the sick in Berlin,1ZERO HOUR311

Archives, WashingtonHamburg, Munich and other cities, wheremakeshift shelters had to serve as homes.Germany was completely defeated and at the
mercy of the occupying armies.The Allies distrusted the Germans: that was theone point, amid all the disputes, on which in 1945they were agreed. But they still expected Germany
to remain uniﬁed under their supervision. Soviet
and Western leaders shared what turned out to be
an accurate perception of the capacity of the
German people for recovery; but they also fearedthat the Germans, unless controlled, would becapable of rebuilding not only their shattered
industry and their cities, but also their destructive
military potential. In their hearts, the Allies
thought the German people had not changed andwere only temporarily submissive in the face ofoverwhelming defeat. They saw the great majority
of Germans as incorrigibly militaristic and as a
threat to a peaceful Europe. By the end of the war,
virtually every German was suspected of havingbeen in league with the evil-doers. These Alliedattitudes cannot be understood today without see-
ing again the newsreels of the liberated concentra-
tion camps shown in all the cinemas, especially (by
Allied command) German ones, immediately after
the end of the war, with their piles of nakedcorpses, the skeletal appearance of the survivors.For the ﬁrst time, ordinary people in the West
came face to face with the full evil of National
Socialist Germany. In Russia and Poland newsreels
were not necessary.Allied planning was based on the belief that,since Europe and the world had to go on living
with some 70 million Germans, they represented
a threat for the future unless they could be led to
change fundamentally. The Russians, as well as
the British, French and Americans, meant toimpose these changes from above – though theyhad very different conceptions of what needed to
be done. They were agreed, however, on the
wholesale removal of the Nazi political leadership
as a prerequisite.Germany had to be taught a lesson in defeatthat would allow no false sense of military honour
to survive. Germany’s neighbours would not be
able to live in peace unless control over Germanywas taken away from the Germans – as had con-spicuously not been done in 1919. That meantoccupation and Allied rule over a completely
powerless Germany (some spoke of this lasting
twenty-ﬁve, even forty, years).The ﬁrst solutions suggested during the war tothis problem of containing Germany proposed torender it harmless by standing down its armed
forces and eliminating the general staffs, suppos-
edly imbued with Prussian military traditions. In
its original form, the Morgenthau Plan of 1944
allowed Germany no heavy industry to manufac-ture cars and no machine tools; instead, lightindustries could make furniture and tin-openers.
Germany would thus become a ‘pastoral’ country;
the industrial region of the Ruhr would be no
more. The standard of living of the Germanswould be at subsistence levels, no higher thanthat of the poorest of the countries in the east
which Germany had occupied, There was, of
course, a strong punitive element in these plans,
felt to be justiﬁed by Germany’s barbaric behav-iour during the war. The large labour force,which would not be able to ﬁnd employment in
Germany, would provide reparations as forced
labour working for the Allies to make good some
of the damage done. But the plan was too unreal
to survive. Seventy million Germans could notlive without export industries. Europe could notmanage without Ruhr coal and steel. Short-term
reparations would not make up for the cost the
Allies would have to bear to keep the Germans
alive. The plan’s shortcomings were realisedimmediately, but its opponents could not elim-inate it altogether; they could do no more than
introduce some changes.After the war was won, US occupation aimswere embodied in the order of the joint chiefs 
of staff (US) JCS 1067, dated 26 April 1945,Germany; British policies did not differ from itsigniﬁcantly, though they embodied a more con-
structive view of the future rehabilitation of
Germany. Sweeping de-industrialisation and the
dismantling for reparations of German factorieswere mandatory. The German people would beallowed only the lowest standard of living that
avoided death and disease. Yet they could not be
condemned to mass starvation: $700 million312POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
annually were needed to pay for food imports tokeep the Germans in the British and Americanzones alive. For Britain especially, with its des-
perate dollar shortage, this was an unacceptable
drain. The Germans should be made to pay for
what they needed themselves, but could do soonly if they were allowed to manufacture goodsagain for export. This stimulated a revision of
thinking about limitations placed on industrial
production from the early draconian four-power
decision of March 1946, to reduce it to 50 per
cent of that in 1938. The economic occupationpolicies from 1945 to 1949 were a mass of con-tradictions: continuing to dismantle factories as
reparations, desiring to break Germany’s indus-
trial potential for war, and removing possibly suc-
cessful commercial rivals from world markets,such as the pharmaceutical industry. Patentsbecame war booty. At the same time there was
growing acceptance that Western Germany had to
be rebuilt, that its prosperity was an essentialsupport of West German and European democ-racy, threatened by the Cold War. Not until 1952were all attempts to limit Germany’s basic heavy
industry, steel, abandoned.Through the hardships of the early years, theGermans had survived better than anyone wouldhave thought possible in 1945. They acceptedcertain limitations – for example, not to manu-
facture nuclear weapons or poison gas. For the
rest, Allied efforts to restructure German indus-
try, break up the powerful cartels and loosen the
hold of the banks were soon reversed.At the start of the occupation there was a hap-hazard mass internment of those deemed to have
served the Third Reich in an important capacity.
German prisoners of war in Allied hands and
labouring abroad, on British farms for instance,were not sent home at the end of the war. TheWestern Allies only agreed to return them by the
end of 1948. But most of the millions taken pris-
oner in Germany itself during the last stages of the1ZERO HOUR313

manual labour, clearing the rubble. Where were
the strongmen? Three and a quarter million were
missing or dead, millions were crippled, and mil-lions had been taken prisoner. Shortly before hisdeath Roosevelt wrote: ‘The German people are
not going to be enslaved. ... But it will be neces-

sary for them to earn their way back into the fel-
lowship of peace-loving and law-abiding nations.’
They would never be entrusted again to beararms. The captains of industry and the NationalSocialist leaders would be tried and treated as
criminals. What was left of industry would be
supervised and ceilings of production imposed.The Germans were told they had been liber-ated, but Allied soldiers were strictly ordered notto ‘fraternise’ with them – to avoid all social con-
tact. Shunned and struggling to survive hunger
and cold, the German people were obliged to sub-
mit to ‘re-education’, the attempt to change theirhearts and minds. Punishment and ‘denaziﬁca-tion’ was one side of the coin, the inculcation of
virtue and democracy the other. Control of the
media and the re-establishment in schools of
sound teaching of the right values were priorities.
Gradually, decentralised political life was encour-aged. The adoption of punitive measures, it wasquickly realised, ran counter to the attempt to
reform the German people. If they were to be
treated as pariahs, how could they be convinced at
the same time of the blessings of liberty?Within occupied Germany, despite manyabsurdities and contradictions, denaziﬁcation and
re-education made a positive contribution. The
Nürnberg Trials of the leaders of Hitler’s state,
which began in November 1945, culminated in
the death sentence on twelve of the accusedeleven months later, and revealed the barbaricnature of the occupation in the east. This evi-
dence confronted the ordinary German people
with unpleasant truths which many of them had
known about but could not face, and only thetotally incorrigible still insisted that the gas ovensof Auschwitz were propaganda. No respect was
felt for Hitler’s lieutenants, who had led Germany
into destruction and suffering, though some sat-isfaction was felt that Göring had outwitted hisjailers by committing suicide before he could behanged. The SS was condemned wholesale by the
Allies as a criminal organisation.Rough justice was meted out to the lesser sup-porters. All Germans were required to ﬁll out aquestionnaire, the famous Fragebogen, whichserved as a basis for denaziﬁcation. Many millions
of Germans had been National Socialists out of
conviction, many opportunistically in hope of
gain, some only under pressure; most had joined
the party or one of its organisations. But only aminority, some 209,000 out of a population of44.5 million, were actually prosecuted in the
special courts set up in the British, American and
French zones (more were tried in the American
than in the British zone). In the Soviet sector,with a population of 17 million, the ﬁgure givenfor those tried is also small, just over 17,000. This
did not imply that the Russians were more for-
giving; they simply did not trouble with court
procedures. Tens of thousands were put in formerNazi concentration camps and thousands losttheir lives, not only Nazi criminals but also oppo-
nents of communism. When categorised, of those
charged with being Nazis only 1,667 were
regarded as chief perpetrators of crimes, 23,060
as partially guilty (belastet), 150,425 as less guiltyand just over 1 million as ‘fellow travellers’. Over5 million suspects were not prosecuted in any
way. Even the Allies came to realise how unsatis-
factory the process was. Minor offenders were not
infrequently treated more harshly than men withfar more on their conscience, including theGauleiter of Hamburg, who after imprisonment
and a quiet period, prospered again in post-war
West Germany. Justice proved too subjective, too
haphazard, and punishment too arbitrary; there
was no clean sweep of all those involved in thecrimes of the Third Reich. The judges, with fewexceptions, continued to sit in judgement, as they
had in the Nazi years; the majority of civil ser-
vants now served their new masters and the ﬁles
they kept frequently show no break. There weresimply too many National Socialists; the task ofpunishment had to be abandoned for all but the
worst criminals and it took years to bring them
to court, many escaping altogether.314POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
Nevertheless, the great majority of Germansdid change after the war. Allied re-education con-tributed to this but it was not the only or even
the main reason for it. Correct as Allied assump-
tions were about Germany’s capacity to recover
from defeat, so they were wrong in believing that,given half a chance, the German people wouldonce again turn to another Hitler with a policy of
expansion and conquest. The total military col-
lapse and its immediate consequences did, in fact,
convince the German people (except for a small
extremist fringe) that in Hitler they had followeda false prophet. To the surprise of the Allies, theexpected Nazi underground movements came to
nothing. The German people soon showed them-
selves anxious to learn from their victors, who had
after all proved themselves stronger and more suc-cessful. Defeat of all things German had proved aradical cure for the mentality of Deutschland überAlles. British representative institutions nowbecame the model, and the American way of life
an aspiration – at least that part portrayed inHollywood ﬁlms and by the comparative illusionof wealth now sustained by the occupying GIs in
their smart uniforms. From the Russians the ben-
eﬁts were less obvious and no one in Germany,
except hardened communists, wished to emulate
their style of life and lower standards of living.The year 1945, marks a decisive breach inGerman history. The lure of conquest and phys-
ical expansion, of lording it as the supposed
Herrenvolk, had ended in evident ruin. Most weresorry they had lost the war; fortunately some didrecognise that they had been ‘liberated’ by theAllies – they would form a small nucleus for cre-
ating a better society.Living conditions proved desperate during thefirst two years of occupation, and its rule by
Russian, American, British and French soldiersand administrators brought home to everyGerman the totality of the defeat. They were now
faced with the practical task of material survival
amid the ruins of their cities. Feelings of guilt did
not in the circumstances spring ﬁrst to mind;there were more immediate needs to attend to.Many of the older generation of Germans did not
repudiate the Nazi past, but Hitler was dead and
new masters had to be served, new political real-ities to be faced. It was different for the young.They increasingly questioned the values of theirparents and could ﬁnd no pride in German history
or indeed in being Germans at all. They saw a 
way ahead in showing themselves to be good
Europeans. And so the two Germanies becamethe first modern nations whose citizens con-sciously turned their backs on the past, some con-
centrating on building a new life and giving little
thought to moral questions, others genuinely
feeling shame for the past. The Western Allies
were not confronted with a task they had thoughtwould take at least a generation to complete.Instead, within two years of the German surren-
der, the East–West confrontation of the Cold War
hastened Soviet and Anglo-American readiness
publicly to accept at face value the ‘new’ reformedGermany, though in private there were still strongreservations about the trustworthiness of Ger-

mans. This residual suspicion of the dangers of
too strong a Germany remained alive after almost
half a century when German unity once morebecame a reality.Stalin was just as anxious to ‘re-educate’ theGerman people in the Soviet zone his way. His
own life experiences in the USSR may well have
made him more optimistic about the prospectsthan the West was. The German people hadshown an enviable readiness to follow strong lead-
ership. For some it was only a question of
exchanging a brown for a red shirt. It was partic-
ularly easy to form new red youth brigades. TheRussians and their German nominees would nowprovide that leadership. As the victors they would
carry away from Germany all the reparations they
could, but Stalin saw no reason why he should
wait before undertaking political re-education and
the transformation of German society. Conﬁdentthat sufﬁcient power at the top could ensure theloyalty of those below, he was ready to use as
instruments not only the Moscow-trained com-
munists, but even leaders of the Wehrmacht,
taken prisoners of war, who as early as 1943 hadbeen formed into the Free Germany Committee.Former supporters of Hitler, provided they were
useful enough, could now rehabilitate themselves
by promising unswerving loyalty to Moscow.1ZERO HOUR315
Others were simply set to work, like the scientistsand rocket specialists. The Western Allies in thisrespect acted no differently. For Stalin the strug-
gle in Germany would be between ‘capitalism’
and ‘socialism’, and the only safe Germany would
be a country whose previous political and socialpatterns had been transformed. Given Stalin’s ideological assumptions he was bound to be
extremely apprehensive about developments in
the Western zones of occupation, where the
majority of Germans lived. In such fears the blos-
soming of the Cold War can be traced.In their relations with the Allies the Germanswere not entirely supine. A nucleus of post-war
German political leaders, unsullied by the Nazi
years, resurfaced, hardened and toughened. They
had a vision of a new Germany and a betterfuture. It was difﬁcult for the communist leadersWilhelm Pieck and Walter Ulbricht, returning
from Moscow in 1945, to be anything but cynical
after Stalin’s terror years, which had claimed so
many of their German comrades as victims, andafter Stalin’s sacriﬁce of the German CommunistParty to the Nazis. But there were also idealistic
communists, survivors of the concentration camps
and returning exiles, who preserved their illusions
of Stalin’s Russia and now were ready to work for
an ‘anti-fascist’ Germany.It was the Soviet authorities in their zone ofoccupation in June 1945 who ﬁrst announced the

revival of the democratic political process by per-

mitting the setting up of political parties – the
Communist Party of Germany (KPD), of course,but also the German Social Democratic Party(SPD), the new conservative Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) and the Liberal Democratic Party,
better known in the West as the Free Democratic
Party (FDP). One-party rule, the cornerstone of
the Soviet political system founded by Lenin, wasreﬁned into Stalin’s totalitarian state, in which nodissenting group was permitted any voice or even
the right to exist. In Germany, then, Stalin was
ready, according to his own lights, to make enor-

mous concessions and to provide communist pre-
dominance with a more acceptable face for thelocal population and for the Western Allies.When the Austrian communists, in genuinelyfree elections in November 1945, secured only 5per cent of the vote, Stalin knew that more wouldbe required in Germany than just to let the partiescompete freely. The Soviet authorities cajoled and
pressurised the Social Democratic Party, led by
Otto Grotewohl in their zone, to fuse with the
Communist Party and so form the Socialist UnityParty (SED). In provincial elections in theautumn of 1946, the SED, despite Soviet help,
failed to win outright majorities over the com-
peting CDU and Liberals, so the SED had to
resort to anti-fascist popular-front tactics to gain
control in the Länderassemblies. Berlin, althoughit fell within the Soviet zone, had been placedunder the joint authority of all the four powers,
so its political parties could not be manipulated
by Moscow like those in the Soviet zone. For 
that reason, moves to fuse the Socialist andCommunist Parties in Berlin were comprehen-sively defeated.This result marked a decisive split in Germany.Given the freedom to choose, the country’s
emerging political leaders rejected totalitarianism.Instead, the two most outstanding politicalﬁgures of the immediate post-war German years,
Kurt Schumacher (SPD) and Konrad Adenauer
(CDU), laid the foundations of a party political
system on which could be based the stable par-
liamentary democracy of the two-thirds ofGermany that formed the Western zones, whichtogether with west Berlin later became the
Federal Republic of Germany. It is to the lasting
credit of Schumacher as well as of Adenauer that
German democracy was not stiﬂed at birth. In theSoviet zone, on the other hand, the Germanpeople were not to be given a free choice until
forty-ﬁve years later. It should also be conceded
that the Germans in the Western zones did not
have a completely free choice: after all, the
Western Allies would not have permitted theirzones to be turned into a totalitarian communiststate. The more important point, however, is that
the Allies’ aim to create a democratic society
reﬂected the wishes of the majority of Germans.The contrast between the two West German lead-ers, Kurt Schumacher and Konrad Adenauer, was
striking. Schumacher’s health but not his spirit
had been broken after long years of incarceration316POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
in a concentration camp, an experience that hadinspired him with a hatred of all forms of totalitar-ianism. He now looked to the British Labour
Party as an example of a democratic socialist party
supporting a parliamentary form of government.
Schumacher was uncompromising on any issue hebelieved involved principle: it was a lack of ﬁrmprinciples that had driven the Germans into the
abyss. He intended to lead a strong independent
party committed to democracy, socialism and the
recovery of dignity, and eventually sovereignty for
a reunited Germany. The victorious Allies wouldonce again be compelled to respect such a re-emerging German nation.Adenauer was in an altogether different posi-tion. No political party except the SPD had
emerged with credit during the Hitler years. Theyhad either played Hitler’s game before January1933 or had compromised immediately after to
hand him dictatorial powers. (The rank-and-ﬁle
communists had no choice: they had to change
allegiance or face persecution.) So Adenauer hadto create an entirely new party, the CDU and itsBavarian ally, the CSU. This called for ﬂexibility,
adroitness and a high degree of political skill.
Party political aims would need to be limited to
essentials. A staunch Catholic and a Rhinelander,
Adenauer enjoyed the better things in life and,although he had courageously deﬁed the Nazis asmayor of Cologne in 1933, thereafter he had
played no active role in Germany’s opposition.
He had lived a comfortable retired life, storing up
his energies for a better future. It was only duringthe last six months of the war that he was arrestedand imprisoned by the Gestapo in the wake of the
Hitler bomb plot of 20 July 1944, in which, like-
wise, he had played no part.Unexpectedly, it was Adenauer in his seventies,and not Schumacher, who dominated post-warGerman politics. Adenauer’s re-entry into politicswas not at first auspicious. Reinstated by the
Americans as mayor of Cologne, his gritty per-
sonality and the scheming of political opponents
led to his dismissal after the British took overcontrol of the city. He re-emerged to challengethe support for Schumacher and the SPD. A third
party, smaller than the other two, was the Liberal
Free Democratic Party (FDP), which at timesexercised a disproportionate inﬂuence because itheld the balance between the two major parties.In the summer of 1946 regional states(Länder) were created in the British, French andUS zones, and local and regional elected assem-
blies reintroduced two-thirds of the Germanpeople to the democratic parliamentary process.Political party organisations were revived. The
Social Democratic Party, led by Schumacher,
competed with the Christian Democratic Union,
which was opposed to socialism and to centralised
state power at the expense of individual rights,and emphasised Christian ethical values as thefoundation of the state.Each of the Länderwas headed by a ministerpresident answerable to a parliamentary assembly
democratically elected. It was in the LänderthatGermany’s leading post-war political leaders ﬁrstcame to prominence – men like Reinhold Maier,
minister president of Württemberg-Baden,
Theodor Heuss, Heinrich Lübke and Professor
Ludwig Erhard. The Western Allies, who had vet-ted and approved them (though not all had beenactive opponents of the Nazi regime) had chosen
this leadership group wisely; in this they made a
crucial contribution to Germany’s post-war demo-
cratic development. Political life recovered. Its
progress, however, depended on Allied willingnessto transfer responsibilities to the Germans, toobtain their cooperation rather than their mere
acquiescence. The process was accelerated by
Western suspicions of the Soviet Union and the
onset of the Cold War.Political leadership is one thing, but howwould the majority of Germans behave when
asked to participate again in a democratic process
after twelve years of dictatorship? How many
politically active Germans were there who had
been compromised? The majority of those whosehands were clean belonged to the left. They feltthat their sufferings in concentration camps, their
exclusion from the German state or their years in
exile now gave them a moral right to lead the new
Germany. Business, big and small, had formed apart of the National Socialist state. German busi-nessmen and farmers had accepted the help of
‘slaves’ from the east, had frequently exploited
their forced labour and had only rarely treated1ZERO HOUR317
them with humanity and consideration. Themajority of Germans were saddled with the guiltof not having cared sufﬁciently for foreigners and
for their own German Jewish neighbours. There
were thus millions of Germans who wished to lie
low. Survival might depend on not drawing atten-tion to one’s self unnecessarily by prominence inpolitics.The more educated, the professional leaders ofthe state, civil servants, judges and lawyers, the
better off and propertied, the doctors, many of
whom had been implicated with Nazi measures,all those who had lived well and comfortablythrough the Hitler years and had provided exper-
tise and leadership, were most heavily compro-
mised and could least afford to play an active role
in post-war politics. The workers, the poor, theconscripts in the army could more easily claimthat they had been misled and were themselves
the exploited, even though such a simple social
division of those who supported and those who
opposed National Socialism does not correspondto the facts. In the immediate months after thecollapse, even the Western occupying forceslooked with more favour on the communist resis-tance than on Germans with an uncertain polit-ical past. Gradually, the Western Allies sifted out
a small elite group of political leaders in the
Länder. It seemed likely at ﬁrst that the left woulddominate post-war German politics; adherents tothe centre and the right of the political spectrumwere willing to share power with the left for two
or three years, ostensibly for the sake of national
reconstruction, but in truth because they were
too obviously compromised to assert their resid-
ual electoral strength more forcibly.In the ill-fated Weimar Republic, there hadbeen a disastrous political backlash from the
extremists once Germany had regained most of its
independence. That did not happen after 1945.
The political leaders who convinced the WesternAllies that democracy was safe in their hands, andwho complied with their terms, were subse-
quently endorsed and won power through free
elections. Germans had been cured of aggressive
nationalism by their total defeat and the disas-trous consequences. A new Germany was born ofprosperity.318POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
Victory over Nazi Germany and its allies came as an immense relief to the Soviet Union. No vic-
torious power had suffered more. The war had
devastated European Russia, 25 million werehomeless, factories were destroyed, railways dis-rupted, mechanised farm machinery virtually non-
existent. Of the population of 194 million before
the war, 28 million had lost their lives; more than
one in four Russians had been killed or wounded.
Stalin did not expect much help from the capi-talist US once the defeat of the common enemieswas accomplished. Supplies had been shipped 
to Russia under the wartime Lend-Lease pro-

gramme, but this was severely curtailed after 
the victory over Germany and was ended alto-gether in August 1945, after Japan’s defeat, forall countries. But crucial Western food supplies
still reached the Soviet Union in 1946 under 
the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
Administration (UNRRA), mainly financed by
the US. This programme saved devastated regionsfrom famine.The Soviet Union tried to obtain immediateassistance by taking away from the former enemy
countries everything that was movable: rails,
factory machines and all kinds of equipment. Itwas an inefﬁcient operation and probably only asmall proportion could be used again when it
reached the Soviet Union. The rest rusted away
in railway sidings. Joint Soviet and Eastern
European companies were formed on terms dic-tated by the Russians; special trade agreementswere reached with former allies, generally favour-ing the Soviet Union. Another important source
of help came from reparations, exacted not only
from the Soviet zones of Germany and Austriabut, for a short time, with Anglo-American coop-eration, from the Western occupation zones as
agreed at Potsdam. Destruction in the Soviet
Union was on a scale almost unimaginable, and
during the war the Germans had treated the
Russians worse than animals. This helps to explainthe Soviet insistence on huge reparations from theproduction of West German industry. But Soviet
demands soon ran counter to Western occupation
policies. The Western Allies realised that it was
they who would in the end have to make goodthese losses or continue to support the Germansin the Western zones with their own subsidies for
years to come. The inter-Allied conﬂict on the
reparations issue became one of the causes of the
Cold War.There were desultory negotiations for a USloan after the war which never came to anything.In the last resort, Stalin had to rely on the sweat
of the Russian people. There was work for the
millions demobilised from the Red Army. During
the war there had been some ideological relax-ation. Now there was a return to orthodoxy.Stalin had not mellowed in old age: coercion
resumed and an army of forced labour was herded
into the Gulag Archipelago, the vast network of
labour camps east of Moscow. Hundreds of thou-sands labelled as traitors were transported from1Chapter 27THE SOVIET UNIONTHE PRICE OF VICTORY AND THE EXPANDING
EMPIREthe Baltic states, which had been annexed in1940; many more from all over the Russianempire were also deported to virtual slavery. The
Communist Party was allowed to re-emerge as
Stalin’s instrument of control over Soviet society.
There was rigid ideological censorship of scienceand all forms of culture, even of composers. Theparty exploited to the maximum the labour of the
peasants and the workers. Military heroes were
relegated to the status of ordinary citizens.The last decade of Stalin’s rule was stiﬂing.Terror returned. Stalin’s Soviet Union was acountry of immense hardship. Nascent internalnationalism was savagely crushed but could never
be entirely suppressed. Jewish national feelings,
especially after the foundation of Israel, drew
world attention to another aspect of Soviet per-secution. Rights, taken for granted in the West,did not exist in Stalin’s Russia.As in the 1930s, Stalin’s economic plans gaveprecedence to heavy industry at the expense of
consumer goods, so the standard of living recov-ered only to a rudimentary level. Draconianlabour laws deprived workers of all freedom and
exposed them to punishment for lateness or
drunkenness. Heavy burdens were laid particu-
larly on the peasantry: the collectives were more
tightly regulated and controlled; the productiveprivate plots of the peasantry were taken away; in1947 collectivisation was extended to the former
Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But
agricultural production, unlike industrial activity,
hardly recovered from the wartime lows. Foodwas forcibly taken from the peasantry for ridicu-lously low prices. There was widespread famine in
the Ukraine in 1946–7. By 1952 the grain and
potato harvests had still not reached the 1940
pre-war level. The failure of ‘socialist’ agriculture
has remained a feature of the Soviet economy.Stalin’s emphasis on heavy industry was condi-tioned by his fear of Western industrial superior-
ity. He took for granted the implacable hostility of
the capitalist West to the Soviet Union. His grip
over Eastern Europe and the maintenance of alarge peacetime Red Army were to compensate forRussia’s economic inferiority. Every effort was also
made to catch up in the ﬁeld of nuclear weapons.
But Stalin clearly wished to avoid a war with theWest. In 1946 he cautiously withdrew demandsmade earlier on Turkey, and later pulled the RedArmy out of northern Iran and Manchuria. Yet the
Soviet position in the post-war world would
depend in the ﬁrst instance on the Red Army.
Globally the Soviet Union stood on its own,exhausted and deeply wounded by war.Stalin feared that the Red Army, as it advancedwestwards, would become aware of the much
higher standard of living enjoyed by the ‘fascists’
and capitalists. The success of Soviet propaganda
depended on keeping the Russian peoples fromWestern contact. Fraternisation with local popu-lations was therefore severely limited where it was
allowed to occur at all. Within the Soviet Union,
rigid censorship about the world outside contin-
ued and a distorted picture of Western hostilityand hate was propagated. The party and Stalin’sleadership were gloriﬁed.Stalin’s post-war revenge was indiscriminate.The victims of Yalta, those Russians who were
forcibly repatriated by the British and Americansafter the war from the zones of occupation, werelucky if they ended up in the Gulag Archipelago.
Others were simply shot. But these thousands of
men, women and children were just the tip of the
iceberg. Whole national groups, such as the
Muslim Tatars and Kalmycks, were deported withgreat brutality from the Caucasus when it wasreoccupied by Soviet armies in 1943 and 1944.
More than 1 million people were collectively pun-
ished and deported. Stalin’s ferocity exposed his
fanatical determination to wipe out any danger to‘Russian’ communist power and Soviet unity fromwithin. The years from 1945 to Stalin’s death in
1953 were as repressive as the terrible 1930s had
been. Stalin ruled by coercion and terror; he was
omnipresent yet totally remote, never meeting the
Russian people face to face. His character was, inKhrushchev’s words, capricious and despotic,brutal tendencies that only increased as his facul-
ties weakened in old age. But he never lacked
henchmen and supporters for his policies; policies
that no one man could have carried throughalone. Coercion and terror formed one essentialelement; the other was compliance. To this end,
Stalin’s immediate helpers received material ben-
eﬁts. A slave army of millions of Russians, arrested320POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
for one reason or another and incarcerated inGulag camps, provided forced labour intended tohelp Soviet recovery; but it was an inhuman and
wasteful use of manpower.Nationalism posed a threat in two ways: ‘bour-geois’ and ‘nationalist’. Wherever nationalist con-sciousness manifested itself, especially in com-
munist states such as Yugoslavia, its advocates
were ﬁercely denounced.In the communist states the leadership exer-cised its will through the one (communist) partythat was allowed to function. The party’s controlwas usually in the hands of one man, sometimes
a small group, whose wills then became ultimate
law. The party apparatus was essential as a means
of government, providing the link between policydecisions and their execution. Only one partycould be tolerated. After 1948, the nations which
the Soviet Union dominated had to conform in
leadership and party organisation to the Soviet
model, even down to the details of the ‘person-ality cult’ and the theatrical plaudits for theleader. Their alliance with the Soviet Union was
not a question of free choice: loyalty to this
alliance was the price exacted for freedom from
direct Soviet military control.Between 1940 and 1945 Stalin expandedSoviet rule over new territories, though he waswell aware of the difﬁculties such absorption of
hostile ethnic groups could create for the Soviet
empire. Where possible, he reasserted the historic
rights of pre-1917 tsarist Russia. Poland was aspecial and most difﬁcult case if only because
there were so many Poles – some 30 million in
1939, but reduced to 24 million in 1945. In re-
establishing the 1941 Soviet frontier, a mixed
population of Belorussians and Ukrainians in the
countryside and Poles in the towns was broughtwithin the Soviet Union, and this was only mitigated by population exchanges of Poles,
Ukrainians and White Russians. The frontier
between Poland and the USSR had some histor-
ical justiﬁcation, since it basically followed thedemarcation proposed at the Paris PeaceConference by Lord Curzon in 1919. Finland,
too, lost territory but retained more of its inde-
pendence. Stalin shrank from incorporating thefiercely independent and nationalist Finns.Instead, he made sure that they understood thatas Russia’s neighbour, and located as they were
far from possible Western help, they would have
to follow a policy friendly to the USSR as the
price of their comparative freedom.In 1945 Stalin retained, without Alliedapproval, the territories of the once independent
Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,
which it had been agreed in the Stalin–Hitler pact
of August 1939 should fall within the Soviet
sphere. The Red Army occupied them in 1940and set up puppet assemblies, which promptlyabandoned their countries’ independence and
acceded to the USSR. Also in 1945, but this time
in agreement with the Allies, the northern third 
of pre-war East Prussia was ‘administered’ by theSoviet Union – in practice incorporated into it. Inthe Balkans, Stalin wanted Bessarabia (Moldavia).
It had been Russian until 1918. After the First
World War ethnic Romanians of Moldavia had
declared for union with Romania. In 1940, withthe acquiescence of Hitler, Romania was forced to cede the territory back to Russia. Finally, to
gain a direct link and common frontier with
Hungary, Stalin pressured the Czechs to cede a
part of their territory, Ruthenia, to the USSR. In
this way he accomplished large acquisitions of landall around the periphery of the Soviet Union fromthe Baltic through central Europe to the Balkans
in the south. But, even beyond these annexations,
the Soviet Union desired further inﬂuence and
control, to destroy the pre-war block of hostilestates, the cordon sanitaire, with which the Westhad tried before 1939 to surround and contain
communist Russia.During the years from 1945 to 1948 Stalinbrought Eastern and central European politicsand societies under Soviet control. He wasobsessed by the fear that eventually the capitalist
powers would take advantage of their superiority
to attack the Soviet Union, which therefore had
only a few years in which to prepare. In Asia, hewas reticent and pacific. The real danger, hebelieved, would develop in Europe. To avoid the
danger of too vehement a Western reaction,
central and Eastern Europe was only gradually1THE SOVIET UNION321
integrated into the Soviet system. One-partycommunist states tied to the Soviet partyremained the goal. To reach it, Stalin had to over-
come the obstacle not only of Western opposition
but more seriously of the intense nationalism of
the ethnic groups living in this region of Europe.It proved impossible to extinguish the loyalties totheir own countries of Yugoslavs, Hungarians,
Poles and Romanians. Their acceptance of the
communist embrace, despite genuine gratitude
for their liberation, fell far short of seeing in the
Soviet Union a desirable overlord. Polish historyhad consisted of the struggle for freedom fromRussia; the powerful Catholic Churches in both
Poland and Hungary identiﬁed themselves with
their countries’ national feelings. Added to such
opposition was the resistance to the social andeconomic revolution demanded by the commu-nists. The relationship between the Soviet Union
and its allies in the socialist camp thus moved
uneasily between attempts at rigid party and
Soviet control and relaxation of that control tothe extent of limited independence.The central and East European states throughwhich in 1944 and 1945 the Red Army march-
ed on its way to Vienna and Berlin can be 
divided into two groups: the Allied nations, Po-
land, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and technicallyAlbania too; and the former enemies, Bulgaria,Romania and Hungary. The ability of Britain and
the US to intercede effectively for allies was, para-
doxically, smaller than the ability to secure some
say in the future of the enemies. In the case ofallies, the only option was to withhold recogni-tion of the government installed by the Russians
in 1945 only for recognition to be granted two
years later.Over the future Czechoslovakia, Allied inﬂu-ence was especially weak. President Benesˇhad
decided that Czechoslovakia’s post-war future leftno choice but to accept Soviet ‘friendship’, which
meant acquiescing in whatever limits Stalin chose
to place on its independence. Benesˇwas rewarded
by being the only Allied head of state to returnto his own country by way of Moscow. As forYugoslavia, the royal government in exile could
not conceivably be re-established without the
support of a large Allied army, for Tito and hiscommunist partisans had assumed control of thecountry, moreover without direct Soviet help.The position of the enemies, of Hungary,Romania and Bulgaria, was different, although
each was under Red Army occupation. Their gov-
ernments and frontiers could not be regularisedwithout peace treaties involving the consent ofBritain and the US. The Allies kept up a constant
stream of protest at the undemocratic conduct of
these regimes set up by the Soviet Union and
withheld their recognition and their signature to
the peace treaties until 1947.In Poland, which he recognised as the mostvulnerable country under Soviet control, Stalin
kept the tightest grip, making few concessions.
Poland remained under the thinly veiled direct
military occupation of the Red Army. The Polisharmy, which had accompanied the Red Army, waslargely ofﬁcered by reliable Soviet ofﬁcers. In the
new communist-dominated government, the only
politician with a considerable following was
Stanislav Mikolajczyk, a non-communist andleader of the Peasant Party who had joined theLublin government from London and now served
as a deputy prime minister. The communist secre-
tary of the Polish Workers’ Party, Wladyslaw
Gomulka, was the real power in Poland. The
communists adopted their usual tactics ofattempting to secure the agreement of the PeasantParty and the non-communist coalition partners
to elections on a ‘single list’; this meant the voters
would be presented not with a choice of parties,
but with one agreed list of candidates, of whichthe Peasant Party and others would be allowedonly a minority. Stalin had promised the Western
Allies early free elections. But, because the com-
munists could not guarantee the results in 1945
despite holding key internal ministries and con-
trolling the police, the army and much of theadministration, they simply postponed the elec-tions for two years. During these years there was
open violence and armed struggle.The Home Army, operating in Poland but loyalto the London government in exile, was dissolvedin July 1945. Embittered by their experiences,some desperate units went underground again and
with a few thousand members of the Ukrainian
Independence Army began terrorist attacks on322POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
administrative ofﬁcials of the Communist Workers’
Party.In parts of the countryside, ﬁghting escalatedinto civil war. Civilian administrators and police
were attacked and killed. Jewish survivors oncemore became the murder victims. Not until 1948could this violence be broken. Until then, the ter-
rorist attacks served the interests of the commu-nists, for they made the postponement of electionsplausible.By fair means and foul the communists did allthey could to undermine support for their polit-ical opponents, who happened also to be theircoalition partners in government. Nevertheless,
the road to socialism was to be Polish and notSoviet. The economic plans were publiclydeclared to be based on the coexistence of a
private, a cooperative and a public state sector. All
the same, there was not much left but the statesector of industry by 1947. All industrial under-takings employing more than ﬁfty workers per
shift were nationalised, which effectively brought91 per cent of industry and banking under statecontrol. The land question was the most immedi-
ately important. In ‘old’ Poland all the large farms
and estates were broken up and distributed to thepeasantry. In the ‘new lands’, vacated by theGermans, peasant settlers were encouraged to join
collective farms. This largesse politically neu-

tralised the peasantry. Few lamented that the pre-war gentry and wealthy industrialists would notbe allowed back their possessions. Intimidation of
political opponents did the rest. Despite theappalling conditions, huge efforts were made torebuild the devastated economy and the towns
and villages of Poland, especially Warsaw.In the election, ﬁnally held in January 1947,the communists won and almost eliminated theirprincipal rivals, the Peasant Party, many of whose
candidates had been intimidated or imprisoned.The Catholic Church remained intact, however,sustaining its links with the majority of the Polish
people. Gomulka tried to reconcile the Poles to
communist rule, but his efforts were to benegated by the need to abandon the Polish roadto socialism. During the barren harshness of
Stalin’s last years the Communist Party was dis-rupted by purges and Gomulka was disgraced inJanuary 1949.Soviet policies in Romania exempliﬁed a different,
gradualist approach determined by internal eventsand by the military situation. At ﬁrst, Stalin may

well have planned a ruthless and simple takeover,with communist-trained Romanians such as AnnaPauker setting up an administration in the wake of
the Red Army’s conquest. But the unexpected
happened. In August 1944, King Michael led acoup that overthrew the fascist government andthen changed sides, from Hitler’s Germany to that
of the Allies. This threw the country open to theRed Army which, with Romanian troops, chasedthe Wehrmacht into Hungary. Romania again lost
Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, but was rewarded
by the return of Transylvania, which in 1940 hadbeen transferred to Hungary by Hitler. Mean-while a Romanian government, including pre-war
Romanian communists, was established, though
these ‘native’ communists were not trusted byStalin. At Moscow’s behest, the popular-front-typegovernments, which included non-communist par-

ties, were reshufﬂed in December 1944 and March
1945 to provide the communists with greaterthough still incomplete power.Soviet army intervention in local administrationeroded popular support for the non-communistparties. Joint Soviet–Romanian companies werefounded, landed estates were broken up, commu-

nists and fellow travellers were labelled ‘demo-
cratic’ and other parties showing any signs ofindependence were stigmatised as ‘fascist’. So-
called ‘free elections’ were held in November
1946. There was intimidation, and the results maywell have been doctored, but the communists hadwon for themselves a sufﬁcient power base to
make their overwhelming electoral victory accept-
able to the Romanian people. In any case thepeople had little choice beyond acceptance since
Western protests would be limited to words.
Britain and the US had already recognised thecommunist-controlled government before theelections. Despite the unsatisfactory elections and
the Anglo-American detestation of communist
regimes, Romania had been written off asinevitably forming part of the Soviet camp, and apeace treaty was signed in February 1947 which
recognised this. King Michael was forced into exileand Romania became a ‘people’s democracy’, thebeginning of four terrible decades.1THE SOVIET UNION323
Although Bulgaria was not at war with theSoviet Union, Churchill had made it clear toStalin in 1944 that it would be allowed to fall
within the Soviet sphere. War having been hastily
declared on Bulgaria, Soviet troops entered and
overran the country in September 1944, without
real Anglo-American opposition. Unlike its
Romanian equivalent, the Bulgarian Communist
Party had had a substantial popular following
before the war and in Georgi Dimitrov a leader
of international reputation following his acquittal
in Nazi Germany for complicity in the Reichstag
Fire. Although he became an inﬂuential ﬁgure in
Moscow as general secretary of the Comintern 
in the 1930s, Dimitrov was not at ﬁrst allowed to return to Bulgaria in the wake of the Sovietinvasion. Instead, Bulgarian communists were
installed in 1944 in another popular-front gov-
ernment, the Fatherland Front, and to begin with
the opposition was not ruthlessly suppressed. But
the respite was only temporary. With the Red
Army stationed in the country and Stalin deter-
mined to consolidate Soviet power, and with no
effective Western counter-measures forthcoming,
the fate of the Social Democratic and Agrarian
Peasant opposition and its party leader Petkov was
sealed. Dimitrov was now allowed to return to
Bulgaria to strengthen the communists.Despite the muzzling of the press, the elec-tions held in October 1946 saw a striking successfor the non-communist opposition. For a few
months, 101 deputies elected by over a million
votes were able to act as a parliamentary opposi-
tion to the communist regime. But in August
1947 Petkov was arrested, tried and sentenced to
death on trumped-up charges of working for
‘Anglo-American Imperialism’. He was shot the
following month. Britain and the US had made
public protests before his execution, but Dimitrov
only reinforced the impression of judicial murder
by declaring that Petkov might have been spared
but for the Anglo-American protests. Of course,
the execution could not have taken place withoutStalin’s acquiescence. To Britain and the USevents in Eastern Europe showed the extent to
which Stalin was prepared ruthlessly to ignore his
international obligations. Like their Romaniancounterparts, the Bulgarian communists turnedtheir country into a particularly brutal and repres-sive ‘people’s democracy’.The Hungarians had been ruled from 1919until 1944 by anti-communist regimes under the
Regent Admiral Horthy. It was his fatal error to
throw in his lot with the German invaders of theSoviet Union in 1941. When events revealed hiserror, he tried to disengage and achieve a peace
with the Soviet Union, but it was too late. It was
the Germans instead who first occupied his
country. In pre-war Hungary army support for
the authoritarian structure had been decisive, andthe need for social reform had gone unsatisﬁed.The dominant aspiration of successive Hungarian
governments was the recovery of territory lost
principally to Romania (Transylvania) by the
Peace Treaty of Trianon in 1920. It was this aspiration that drove Hungary into the arms of Germany and even to declare war on Russia 
in 1941. By then Hungary had already been
rewarded, in 1940, by the transfer of northern
Transylvania from Romania, as well as of portions
of Czechoslovakia. Defeat in 1945 entailed theloss once more of all these gains as Stalin redis-tributed the territories, Britain and the US again
raising no objections.Stalin’s opportunism is well illustrated by theﬁrst anti-German Hungarian government set upby the Red Army in the part of Hungary they hadliberated. Soviet military requirements at this time
made it expedient to include many former sup-
porters of Horthy, as well as communists and
members of other parties. As circumstances
changed, so would the composition of the gov-ernment. The leading Hungarian communist wasMátyás Rákosi, who had lived in Moscow since
1940; he now returned to participate in coalition
governments. He began with patriotic appeals in
1944 promising democracy and peaceful progress,yet within four years Hungary was transformedinto one of the most ruthless of the Stalinist
‘people’s democracies’. Rákosi’s approach corres-
ponded to Stalin’s own: cautious opportunism
ruthlessly pursued. Hungarians, not Russians,would be allowed to transform politics and societyand would guarantee national loyalty to the Soviet
Union. Three parties besides the communists324POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
were allowed to organise and participate innational politics.The Catholic Church too played an importantrole, acting as a bulwark against atheistic com-
munism. Stalin proceeded in Hungary withcaution, permitting free elections in November1945. The communists lost badly. Stalin was not
going to repeat such an error.Still, Rákosi, with Soviet backing, retained thekey to power through his control of the InteriorMinistry and the secret police. He skilfully
exploited differences between the government
coalition parties, cynically commenting later thathe had sliced them away like salami until only thecommunists were left. First the Smallholders’
Party was eliminated, then the Social Democrats.
In the 1947 elections, communist victory was nolonger left to the whim of the voters. Within afew months, Rákosi and his lieutenants had taken
over the country, and a new ‘constitution’ in
1949 turned Hungary into a Moscow-style‘people’s democracy’.There were few indications in 1945 thatYugoslavia would differ in any significant way
from the other states in Eastern Europe liberatedfrom the Nazis with the help of the Soviet Union.If anything, Yugoslavia was more obviously com-
munist, controlled from the start by Marshal Broz
Tito as undisputed leader organising a one-partystate, ideologically bound to Marxism–Leninism.The military victory of the partisans who had been
ﬁghting the Germans left little alternative but to
accept Tito’s terms for the post-war reconstruc-tion of Yugoslavia. Only a military occupation,Soviet or Allied, could have altered that. Inter-
estingly, in 1944 Stalin had encouraged the idea
of an Allied landing in Yugoslavia, evidentlyalready seeing in Tito’s Yugoslav communism adangerous national deviation. A closer study of
Yugoslavia shows both similarities with and
important differences from the general pattern of the communist takeover of the central andEastern European states. None of the communist
resistance forces was strong enough to defeat the
Wehrmacht without the victories of the RedArmy. This was no less true of Yugoslavia,although there the partisans actually liberated the
country from German occupation.Tito was well aware that the partisan victorywould be dependent upon the victory of theSoviet Union. He also followed Lenin’s precept
of a tightly disciplined party as indispensable for
maintaining communist power. During the war
the German and Italian occupation had destroyedthe pre-war social and political order. Yugoslavcommunists and the royalists fought each other
for predominance at the same time as they 
fought the Germans. This triangular struggle was
complex, the two Yugoslav sides accusing each
other of helping the Germans to eliminate theinternal enemy. Initially Tito drew his supportoverwhelmingly from Serb peasants attracted by
promises of greater social justice and by appeals
to their patriotism. The Serbs were the largest
national group and Tito succeeded in winningover far more to his side than the royalistChetniks did. But from the ﬁrst he was also aware
that Yugoslav unity required the support of all the
major national groups – Croats, Macedonians,
Montenegrins and Slovenes. He created people’scommittees in villages, towns and provinces,promising full national rights to the major nation-
alities in a post-war federal Yugoslavia.Milovan Djilas, Tito’s friend and supporteruntil 1954, has described Tito vividly as a man
born a rebel, who combined a distinctive zeal forcommunism with a personal zest for power; likesome Eastern potentate Tito, once the hardened
partisan leader, built villas and palaces after the
war for his exclusive pleasure, even though he
could spend little time in any one of them. Thedictatorship of the proletariat became in practicepersonal power wielded by an autocratic leader.
Tito created a new party hierarchy, himself at the
pinnacle and the secret police as the instrument
for securing compliance by dealing ruthlessly with
his opponents. In 1946 a constitution on theSoviet model was established, which guaranteedthe cultural and administrative rights of all the
nationalities in a federal Yugoslav state; this went
some way towards solving the nationality conﬂicts
of pre-1945 Yugoslavia, at least for a time. Tito’ssecond achievement was his resolute defence ofYugoslavia’s own road to socialism in 1948 in 
the face of Stalin’s onslaught, and the assertion 
of Yugoslavia’s independence from Moscow’s1THE SOVIET UNION325
control. The monolithic Soviet empire cracked forall the world to see.The road to total communist power was differentagain in Czechoslovakia. Edvard Benes
ˇ, the president of the Czech government in exile inLondon, had signed a formal alliance and friend-
ship treaty with the Soviet Union in December
1943 by which the Russians undertook not to
interfere in Czechoslovakia’s internal affairs. But
Stalin had already established a communist émigré
group in Moscow, led by Klement Gottwald. Theexperience of Munich in 1938, when Britain andFrance had forced the Czechs to give in to Hitler’s
territorial demands, had convinced Benes
ˇthat he
should stay on good terms with the Russians,
because Western protection could not be reliedupon. He hoped that by demonstrating theCzechs’ genuine friendship he would be allowed 
to maintain democracy and Western values. He
saw Czechoslovakia’s role as forming a bridge
between East and West. As if to emphasise Czechreliance on the Soviet Union, Benes
ˇreturned to
Czechoslovakia via Moscow in the spring of 1945.
Ominously he now had to agree to new terms
which further limited his freedom of action. 
The government in exile would be replaced by a
new National Front government for liberatedCzechoslovakia in which only the parties of the leftwould participate, and key ministries for the inter-

nal control of the country would be in communist
hands. In return, Benes
ˇreceived Stalin’s empty
promise that the Soviet leader would deal with anycommunists who gave him trouble. Benes
ˇhad also
to agree to a social and economic transformation
(designed to pave the way to communism) and to
the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans. Real
democracy through representative government
was not re-established in 1945, only its appear-
ance. Czechoslovakia was bound to follow theSoviet Union in any policy Stalin regarded as
important, even before the communist takeover in
1948; the Czech recantation of participation in the
Marshall Aid Programme in 1947, on Moscow’sinsistence, was a good illustration of this.The Czech communist leader, KlementGottwald, was told by Moscow to content himself
with a gradual path to absolute power. Duringthe war the communists had organised a resis-tance movement against the Germans; after itthey not only held the key ministries and domin-
ated the trade unions, but established their
national committees in villages, towns and
provinces. Economic transformation began with
the nationalisation of large industries and busi-
nesses even before the provisional parliament met
in October 1945. But later that month the
American forces and the Red Army, who had
jointly liberated the country, agreed to withdraw,
giving hope to the democrats, although the
country was split between the communists and
the democratic parties of the left. Elections were
held in May 1946, but they were not absolutelyfree since only the parties comprising the NationalFront were allowed to participate. Furthermore,
many Czechs feared that, if the communists failed
to win, the Red Army would return. Given all
their preparatory work and control, it is hardly
surprising that the communists polled 37 per cent
of the votes. But, even with their fellow travellers
among the Social Democratic Party, this did not
give them absolute control. Nonetheless the
democratic opposition, stronger in Slovakia than
Bohemia and Moravia, was weakened by being
split among three parties.In the new government, formed after the elec-tions, Klement Gottwald became prime minister;the two Czechoslovaks best known abroadretained their former positions, Benesˇas president
and Jan Masaryk as foreign minister. But soon the
communists inside and outside the government
started to behave high-handedly, and mass arrests
of their opponents were ordered. Clashes in 
parliament and between government ministers
became increasingly heated and the supporters 
of the democratic parties were considering
whether they would not have to resist violations
of justice if democracy was to survive. But to the
outside world the presence of Benesˇand Masaryk
appeared to guarantee the preservation of civil
rights; that illusion was shattered early in 1948.One of the major headaches for the EasternEuropean communist leaders was the difﬁculty of
discovering what Stalin really wanted. At lower
levels, Russian advice and inﬂuence were at times326POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
confusing or contradictory. Gottwald, a loyalcommunist, believed in 1947, for example, thatStalin would not object if Czechoslovakia partic-
ipated in the Marshall Aid Programme; as we have
seen, he was rapidly obliged to recant. But when-
ever Stalin made his views known the communistsmade speed to fall into line.A façade of representative institutions wouldplacate the West; meanwhile the US was pulling
most of its armed forces out of Europe. Firm
communist bases in Czechoslovakia, Romania,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland and the Soviet zoneof Germany were established. Everywhere com-munists were strongly entrenched and dominant
in coalition National Front governments. The
political activities of other parties were controlled,
and those labelled ‘fascist’ were banned. Theinfluence of the landowners was removed bydividing up their estates, and for the time being
the peasantry beneﬁted from the redistribution of
land: for this, the communists gained the credit.
Large industries were nationalised, and progres-sively the smaller ones as well. The economic baseof the dominant wealthy pre-war social groups
was destroyed; in Poland it had already been
destroyed by the Germans. With local committees
established in every community, the communistsentrenched their inﬂuence to prepare for ultimatecontrol as soon as the Kremlin judged the timeright.In each country there were differences too. TheCatholic Church was powerful enough in Poland
and Hungary to form an opposing force. Socialand economic conditions also differed, Polandhaving suffered more grievously during the Second
World War than any other Eastern European state
apart from the Soviet Union. The strength of the
anti-communist opposition varied from country to
country too, as did the tactics adopted by the com-
munist leaders. In Czechoslovakia, the commu-
nists were sufﬁciently strong to seek control by

semi-legal means; in Yugoslavia, the communists
took control from the start. But all the countries in
the Soviet orbit had this in common: the dynamicsof the social and political changes introduced after1944–5 were bound to end in a communist
victory.Communist domination after 1948 did notmean the end of political strife. The Moscow-trained communist leaders turned on the ‘native’communists in great purges during the closing
years of Stalin’s rule. The revolution began to eat
its own children. Moscow’s was a savage domin-
ance over a turbulent region.1THE SOVIET UNION327
Victorious British armies had shared with theAmericans the reconquest of Italy, France and
Germany in arduous campaigns from the beach-
heads of Salerno and Normandy to the Elbe.What the British now feared was that theAmericans would depart from Europe and simply
return to pre-war isolationism and so leave Britain
facing the Soviet Union alone.The British people rejoiced on VE (victory inEurope) Day and saw it as proving the powers ofendurance and the superiority of the British;Churchill’s government knew better and recog-
nised the serious problems that lay ahead. The war
in Asia against Japan had still to be won. Hidden
from general public recognition were other facts:the bleak position of Britain’s ﬁnancial resources,its foreign assets decimated by the purchase of war
supplies; the extent to which the US had provided
essential foods, raw materials and weapons under
the wartime ‘Lend-Lease’ arrangement which
meant postponing payment, not avoiding it alto-gether. Without US help, the British economy –geared until mid-1945 to the war effort – was not
able to provide the British people even with the
standard of living possible during the war. And
now in addition came the cost of maintaining theminimum living standards of the former enemy inthe British zone of occupation. The food
imported into Germany had to be paid for by
Britain from its small dollar reserves.If continental Western Europe was to be pre-vented from sliding into chaos and protectedfrom Soviet expansion or subversion, the activesupport of the US was essential. Yet there were
considerable and persisting Anglo-American dif-
ferences. In the US there was still a widespreadbelief that Britain remained an unrepentant imperialist power and a potentially formidable
trading rival. British policies in Palestine restrict-
ing Jewish immigration caused bitterness on both
sides of the Atlantic. Finally, despite his robust
language, President Harry S. Truman thoughtthat the US and the Soviet Union could reach anaccommodation and that it was Britain, bent on
defending its worldwide colonial interests, that
might provoke the Soviet Union into conﬂict.Until the US was ready to recognise its newresponsibilities in regions of the world which ithad hitherto not regarded as falling within
spheres essential to its own security, Britain had
to ﬁll the vacuum. Meanwhile, there was uncer-
tainty about America’s long-term commitment to
Western Europe, and about US readiness todefend Western interests in Asia, the Middle Eastand the Mediterranean. So, until March 1947, it
was Britain that ﬁnancially as well as militarily
took up the burden of supporting the anti-
communist government in Greece.With resources so overstretched, there was anurgent need to limit Britain’s more costly respon-
sibilities. India had been promised its independ-
ence, and after the end of the war it could no
longer be delayed. The Labour governmentgrasped this nettle: Lord Mountbatten arrived inChapter 28BRITAIN AND THE WORLD
A LEGACY TOO HEAVY TO BEAR
Delhi as the last viceroy to India on 22 March1947. On 14 and 15 August India and Pakistangained their independence. Partition had proved
unavoidable, and the tragedy of communal vio-
lence and murders marred Britain’s wise decision
to give up willingly the ‘jewel’ of its empire.The ﬁrst important post-war decision to be takenwas a political one – who was to govern Britain?
The election in July 1945 took place while the
war was still continuing in the Paciﬁc. British

troops were ﬁghting in Burma and the Japanesewere fanatically resisting the advance of theAmericans on the island approaches to their
homeland. The war was expected to last many
more months, until the atomic bomb revealed its
awesome power and unexpectedly ended theﬁghting. But in the weeks following Germany’ssurrender all this was momentarily put aside. VE
Day, victory in Europe, was celebrated. There
were parties in every street. Burma was far away
except for those with relatives still ﬁghting thereor whose next of kin were starving in Japaneseprisoner-of-war camps. The great majority of
people in Britain were now hopefully anticipating
the rewards of peace. Churchill wanted the coali-
tion with Labour to continue until the defeat of
Japan; when the Labour ministers in his govern-ment rejected this proposal, he fought the elec-tion in July on the appeal that he should be given
the mandate to ‘ﬁnish the job’.Outside Britain it seemed incredible that theBritish people, who owed so much to Churchill,should now with apparent ingratitude turn himout of ofﬁce. Even in his own constituency the
Labour candidate attracted substantial support.
But the election was not about the conduct of the
war. Indeed, Churchill’s electoral tour was a per-
sonal triumph, with ordinary people everywheremobbing him to express their gratitude andgenuine affection. The Labour leader Clement
Attlee appeared a colourless little man by com-
parison. Yet it was Attlee not Churchill who
entered 10 Downing Street after the biggest land-slide since the election of 1906, which had giventhe Liberals victory. However much the British
‘ﬁrst-past-the-post’ electoral system might exag-
gerate the disparity of the parties’ fortunes, it wasa striking turnaround from the last election, heldin 1935, when the Conservatives and their sup-
porters had returned 432 members and the oppo-sition parties could muster only 180.Why was the swing of votes to Labour so large,especially among the servicemen? Churchill him-
self, as the electoral asset on which the Tory Party
managers were banking, proved insufﬁcient to

turn the tide. Conservative promises of a new deal based on the Beveridge Report of 1942 werenot so very different from those of the Labour
Party, but the electorate doubted whether the
Conservative heart was really in reform. It is 
also true that Churchill mishandled the electoralcampaign by overdoing his condemnation of‘socialism’ as embodied in the Labour Party’s
programme. He denounced Labour as setting out
on a path to totalitarian rule that would lead to
a British Gestapo. He derided Attlee as a ‘sheep
in wolf’s clothing’. It was impossible to persuadea sophisticated British electorate that Attlee,Bevin and Morrison were now not to be trusted
despite their outstanding accomplishments as
ministers in Churchill’s all-party War Cabinet.
The Gestapo jibe badly misﬁred.But probably none of this explained the mag-nitude of the Conservative defeat. There was one
factor more powerful than any other: the mem-
ories of the bitter hardship of unemployment
during the 1930s, of slums, of ill health and of a
society that had failed to provide fair opportuni-ties to the majority of the British people. In July1945 millions of troops faced imminent demo-
bilisation. Were the Conservatives likely to have
their interests at heart? Would the government
ensure that worthwhile work was found for every-one or would the employers be allowed to pickand choose, to depress wages in free-market style,1BRITAIN AND THE WORLD329

careless of the poverty of the masses? It was thisdeep distrust of the Conservative Party, regardedby Labour supporters as the party of the well-to-
do, that induced a larger proportion of working
people and soldiers than ever before, together
with traditional Labour supporters, to put theirfaith in a socialist government and in a prime min-ister, Clement Attlee, who had previously been
overshadowed by Churchill. Ernest Bevin and
Herbert Morrison had had a far greater impact
during the pre-war and war years. Yet Attlee
proved a most effective and even wily leader; withhis pipe, his baggy trousers and his mousey mous-tache, his mild-mannered image was in sharp con-
trast to the larger-than-life Churchill.The transfer from military service to peacetimeemployment was managed by the Labour gov-ernment with considerable skill, an effective
example of good planning. But the women who
had manned the factory benches now frequently
had to give up their jobs to the men. This timesoldiers, unlike after the First World War, weredemobilised in an orderly and fair fashion and
only as fast as they could be reabsorbed in civil-
ian work. This meant Britain still had more than
900,000 men in the forces in 1948. The free
‘utility’ civilian clothes supplied to everyone onleaving the army were just the ﬁrst sign that thefuture had been thought out. Retraining facilities
and vacancies in industry became available as
wartime production was switched to that of
peacetime. There was great demand for goodsand a need for new housing and public works.A most important feature of the celebratedBeveridge Report of 1942 agreed by all three par-
ties at the time, Conservative, Labour and Liberal,
was a commitment that the government’s running
of the nation’s economy would ensure fullemployment. Never again should the hungry1930s, with the hated means test, be allowed to
return. Labour and Conservative governments
were able to fulﬁl that pledge for a generation,
unemployment rarely rising above 2 per cent or half a million. The other promises of theBeveridge plan, more wholeheartedly supported
by Labour and the Liberals than by Conservatives,
were to provide insurance for the whole of thepopulation for the basic needs of life, and on deatha grant for their burial. The state would take careof its citizens from the ‘cradle to the grave’. A
health service would provide medical treatment
for the whole family regardless of who was work-
ing and who was not. Together, these measureslaid the foundations of the post-war welfare state.They represented a tremendous advance in work-
ing people’s standards of living, an indirect ‘social
wage’ provided by the Exchequer from the differ-
ential contributions and taxes of the whole popu-
lation. The Conservatives doubted from the startwhether the state could afford to make such far-reaching promises entailing vast expenditure.
There were reforming Tories in the wartime coali-
tion too, but by 1945 they had passed only one
important measure through Parliament, R. A.Butler’s Education Act of 1944, which whenimplemented raised the school-leaving age to ﬁf-
teen and reorganised the educational system so
that better opportunities would be opened to all.
The Labour government translated theoreticalwelfarism into practical measures. The InsuranceAct of 1946 and – after a struggle between
Aneurin Bevan, the ﬁery Welsh minister of health,
and the doctors, which ended in a compromise
over the continuation of private medicine – the
National Health Service Act of the same year were the two most important measures of the new government, which carried out and extended
the Beveridge plan.The commitment to socialism, however,remained largely a matter of theory. In practicethe Attlee administration’s approach was prag-
matic, aiming at the gradual transformation of the
British economy. This reﬂected the electorate’s
mood accurately enough. The majority of the
people were interested, not in theories of socialism
but, rather, in gaining a better standard of living,a fairer share of the nation’s production, moreequal opportunity – in short, ‘social justice’. The
continued rationing of food was one way of shar-
ing out what was essentially in short supply. Basic
foods were subsidised, so even the poorest peoplecould afford to buy their rations. The people hadnever enjoyed better health. State ownership was
extended only where it seemed necessary. The
Bank of England was nationalised, but not the330POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
commercial banks or the insurance companies.The coal mines, civil aviation, the railways, and gasand electricity production were also brought
under state control by the close of 1947, with the
employers and shareholders receiving compensa-
tion. But although now ‘owned by the people’,the workers did not play a new and signiﬁcant rolein running state industries. The government
appointed a management team, who were fre-
quently none other than the former managers,
and the workers at best exchanged one set of
employers for another. Consequently nationalisa-tion had little impact on good industrial relations.More important in this respect was the TradeDisputes and Trade Union Act 1946, which
repealed the restrictions placed on trade union
power after the General Strike of 1926. A gener-ation later new efforts would be made by bothLabour and Conservative governments to restrict
trade unions once again in the actions they could
take without incurring legal penalties. By then,
the majority of the electorate had come to feelthat the balance of power had swung too far infavour of the trade unions and against the
national interest.The ability to feed Britain during the immedi-ate post-war years, to pay for raw material and to
revive industry was dependent not only on fol-lowing sound policies, which Labour did, nor onthe mobilisation of Britain’s depleted capital
resources, but also on American help. By them-
selves, the British could not earn enough dollars
to pay for the imports necessary for Britain andthe German zone of occupation. There were noillusions about the country’s plight in this respect.
The problem appeared to be a transitional one.The Roosevelt administration had made itclear that it was prepared to help in post-war
reconstruction and that it would not return toisolationism. It was obvious that the US wouldemerge from the war as the world’s economic
superpower unscarred and unscathed by the
ravages of ﬁghting at home. In this task of recon-
struction, Britain was America’s principal partner,and Anglo-American economic plans for the post-war world had been prepared in continuous
rounds of discussion since 1942. They took con-
crete form at a conference held under the aegisof the United Nations in a Washington suburb atBretton Woods.In their planning of the world economic futurethe British and American administrations knew
they were dealing with crucial problems that wentfar beyond technical details. If the mistakes afterthe First World War, which led to international
economic warfare, mass unemployment and the
great depression, were not simply to be repeated,
a sensible method of achieving economic cooper-
ation and mutual support would need to beworked out. The US would, for a time at least,have to provide massive assistance. On this the
Americans and the British were agreed. It corres-
ponded to American custom that the form of this
cooperation should be institutionalised. AtBretton Woods the foundations were soundlylaid, even though solutions were not found for
every international economic problem likely to
arise in the post-war world.The details of the Bretton Woods agreementsare complex, but the essential points can be sim-pliﬁed and understood without expertise in high
ﬁnance. The key was US concern about discrim-
ination in worldwide trade. Individual countries
in the 1930s had rigidly attempted to control
their foreign imports. One important mechanismthat national governments could most effectivelyuse to this end was exchange control: the impo-
sition of restrictions on the exchange of their own
currency for those of other countries. Sterling was
a currency used in world transactions; if itsexchange into dollars were restricted, thenBritain, the Commonwealth (except Canada) and
many other countries trading in sterling would
not be able to buy from the US, and worldwide
there would be a barrier to trade. An important
part of the Bretton Woods agreements was anundertaking to make all currencies freely convert-ible after a transitional period of five years;
exchange rates between currencies, including the
dollar, would be ﬁxed and regulated by a new
international institution, the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF). It was intended thatexchange rates should be stable and that they
should be changed only with the consent of the
IMF. The resources of the Fund were to be made1BRITAIN AND THE WORLD331
up of contributions from each member countryin gold and currencies in proportion to thestrength of its economy. The US supplied by far
the biggest single contribution. Each country
could draw on the Fund to make up a shortfall in
foreign currency if its trade was not in balance;but if it drew on the Fund beyond a certain limitthe IMF could prescribe conditions for its loan
and demand that measures it thought necessary
should be adopted to correct the trade imbal-
ances. The decision-making apparatus of the IMF
was a crucial feature. Members did not each havean equal vote with decisions by majority onimportant issues. It was intended that rates of
exchange, for instance, could be changed only by
a four-ﬁfths majority of the Fund’s board of direc-
tors. Each member country appointed one direc-tor, but his vote was weighted in accordance withhis country’s share in the IMF. This gave the US
a preponderant inﬂuence, and the IMF is appro-
priately located in Washington. In return for the
large US contribution to the resources of theIMF, conditions were agreed that were aimed atpreventing discrimination in world trade, and
thus discrimination against the US for lack of
dollars. A twin to the IMF is the World Bank,
which provides development loans, but it has
played a much less important role than the IMFin post-war international trade and the worldeconomy. But the hopes placed in these institu-
tions for facilitating the free ﬂow of world trade
and the free convertibility of currencies were only
partially realised after 1945.It is curious that, in the pursuit of freer trade,import duties or tariffs did not play a more
important role in American thinking. The US
retained its own high tariffs against imports and
thought only in terms of their gradual inter-

national reduction by international agreement.The bargaining for reductions of tariffs began inApril 1947 when twenty-three countries met in
Geneva; in October that year they concluded the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
What the US particularly wanted to achieve wasthe elimination of large trading blocks whichtraded among themselves preferentially, erecting
higher tariffs against outsiders. The British
Commonwealth had set up such a system in 1932by the Ottawa Agreement, which establishedimperial preference. The American negotiatorsoffered large reductions in US tariffs, but Britain –
faced with myriad ﬁnancial difﬁculties – clung to
imperial preferences until obliged to eliminate
most of them when joining the EuropeanEconomic Community in 1973. Further roundsof trade bargaining continued under the auspices
of GATT without resulting in the freeing of all
trade barriers as originally envisaged.The arrangements worked out at BrettonWoods did not, however, solve Britain’s orWestern Europe’s immediate problems. With theUS alone able to supply what Britain and the
Western European nations needed for their
reconstruction, and with inadequate recovery in
Europe producing insufﬁcient exports to the US,not enough dollar funds were available to makethe necessary purchases in America. This was
called the ‘dollar gap’.In ﬁghting Nazi Germany, Britain had subor-dinated all its economic policies to just one aim,to maximise the war effort. As a result its exporttrade had dwindled to a third of the pre-war level;
not enough was produced at home to match
wages, so inﬂation resulted; Britain’s dollar and
gold reserves and its large overseas assets had
been used to ﬁnance the war; Britain had alsoaccumulated large sterling debts as a result ofwartime expenditure; the national debt had
tripled and Britain’s industry, adapted to produce
armaments, now had to be transferred to peace-
time manufacture for the domestic and exportmarkets. The dislocation was enormous, in Britainas elsewhere. Millions were still in the services and
could only gradually be demobilised. The
dilemma for Britain was that it had to import
food and raw materials to supply its people and
industry, and to pay for them it needed to exportmanufactured goods as well as to earn returnsfrom the city of London’s ﬁnancial and insurance
services (invisible earnings). It was impossible to
achieve such a turnaround from wartime produc-
tion instantly. During the war itself, Britain’sessential needs had been met by American Lend-Lease. Then came the crunch. In August 1945,
with the president’s economic advisers judging
that the special circumstances of war were now332POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
over, and with Congress unlikely to agree to fundthe arrangement in peacetime, Truman abruptlyended Lend-Lease.Something had to be done about the yawningdollar gap that was immediately in prospect.
Britain’s most distinguished economist, JohnMaynard Keynes, was despatched to Washingtonto negotiate a loan to tide Britain over. The
Lend-Lease debts now had to be settled. This
seemed especially unjust in British eyes since the
money had been spent fighting the common
enemy: furthermore, Lend-Lease had been madeavailable only in 1942 when Britain had been atwar for three years. By then Britain had already
spent most of its foreign reserves and assets. The
Lend-Lease debts were settled with a loan, not
cancelled. A loan of $3,750 million at 2 per centinterest was granted to Britain to overcome itsdollar shortage. Repayments were to begin in
1951 in ﬁfty equal annual instalments. The loan
was not as much as Britain had hoped for but the
Canadians helped with an additional $1,287million. The total was sufﬁcient to cover Britain’sown immediate needs, including those of the
British zone in Germany, though not those of the
whole sterling area.There was also the serious problem of the‘sterling balances’. (If all the sterling-area coun-tries sought to convert their holdings of sterlingat the same time, Britain could not have paid and
would therefore have defaulted.) At Bretton
Woods, Britain had reserved to itself the way it
would settle the large sterling balances with itscreditors during the transitional period, ratherthan accepting American help and making a joint
Anglo-American approach to its creditors. Britain,
with some justice, was suspicious of US anti-
imperialist attitudes and did not wish the
Americans to be able to meddle in Britain’sCommonwealth and colonial relationships.Nevertheless these sterling balances were a
Damocles’ sword overhanging the British
economy because they were so large at $3,355
million. The US, in loan negotiations concludedin December 1945, made it a condition thatwithin one year of drawing on the loan (that is,
early in 1947) all current transactions by all the
sterling-area countries should be freely convert-ible. As for the huge credits, the parties could dono more than reach an agreement in principle,without ﬁgures attached: some small part of these
balances were to be immediately convertible to
dollars; another tranche would become convert-
ible in 1951; and as regards the rest Britain wouldseek agreement to write them off. Without ﬁguresthis was a pretty meaningless arrangement except
that in some magical way, which no one could
really envisage, the sterling balances would be
made to disappear. There was much opposition
to these American conditions in Britain, but therewas little choice. They were accepted.In February 1947 Britain honoured the loanagreement and made sterling convertible. The
result was a disaster. The British treasury could
not control all the countries that now convertedsterling into badly needed dollars. Not onlycurrent transactions as provided for in the loan
agreement but some sterling balances held by
other countries were converted as well. In August
1947, with the dollar reserves near exhaustion,Britain was forced to suspend convertibility. Itsrecovery was not far enough advanced to stand
the strain. Exchange control was reintroduced
and thus one important plank of Bretton Woods
was abandoned. The Americans had misjudged
the situation and had forced the issue of free con-vertibility too soon. By the 1950s sterling becamepartially convertible and in December 1958,
almost thirteen years from the time of the ﬁrst
dollar loan, it became fully convertible. By then
West European exports had recovered, theEuropean dollar gap had disappeared andAmerican overseas trade and expenditures were
beginning to move into deﬁcit. Other planks of
Bretton Woods, however, continued to function
for three decades. Fixed exchange rates were
adjusted from time to time until they were aban-doned in the early 1970s. Back in 1947, forBritain and Europe the situation would have
become serious, with a new dollar gap in prospect
once more, had not Marshall Aid come to the
rescue the following year.The effect of these abstract ﬁnancial matters onthe lives of ordinary people in Britain was very
damaging. The man-made ﬁnancial crisis came on1BRITAIN AND THE WORLD333
top of an act of God, a terrible winter of heavysnowfall and ice. Coal was running out, unem-ployment temporarily soared, and now in the
summer the government announced an austerity
programme to cut imports. Rationing became
more severe. Sir Stafford Cripps, gaunt andascetic, symbolised the new era of austerity whenhe took charge of the treasury as chancellor of 
the exchequer in November 1947. Food rations
were small, though the population judged as a
whole was in better health than before the war.
Wages were low, and modest increases kept themlow. Working people were asked to produce morewithout more pay – a theme to become familiar
in the post-war era. Britain was probably one of
the few countries in the world where a sense of
fair play and discipline could make rationing workyear after year without a large black market devel-oping. Output in 1948 was already 36 per cent
higher than before the war, and this production
was being directed to support an export drive.
Given the difﬁcult conditions with which the gov-ernment was faced, it could take credit for itsachievements so far. ‘Better times’ for the people
were nevertheless still a long way off. Full employ-
ment was taken for granted, so Labour would run
into difﬁculties when people tired of the unend-
ing prospect of austerity.Britain’s dire ﬁnancial plight forced the Cabinet
to sort out British priorities in the rest of the world;
Hugh Dalton, when at the treasury (1945–7),
constantly urged Ernest Bevin at the Foreign
Ofﬁce to cut back on Britain’s overseas responsi-
bilities. The Foreign Ofﬁce, which rapidly came to
admire him, had never known a foreign secretary
like the tough, blunt and ebullient Bevin, proud 
of his working-class background and his long 
experience as leader of the largest trade union, 
the Transport and General Workers’ Union; he had also been an effective minister of labour inChurchill’s wartime coalition. Deeply committed
to the democratic left, he was just as determined as
Churchill not to allow communism any power base
in Britain or in any region abroad where vitalBritish interests were involved. Nor did he lagbehind Churchill when it came to safeguarding
Britain’s empire. Thus he supported Churchill’s
policy of suppressing the communist-dominatedfront (EAM) in Greece despite vociferous protestfrom the British left, because, as he put it, ‘theBritish Empire cannot abandon the position in the
Mediterranean’. In Europe, Bevin in 1945 still
regarded resurgent Germany as a greater danger
than the Soviet Union. He shared Roosevelt’svision rather than Churchill’s realism, however, inhis belief that war could be avoided by a strong
world organisation, the United Nations, with the
US, Britain and the Soviet Union each guarantee-

ing the peace in its own global region. Bevin was at
ﬁrst more ready than the Americans to accept theplace of the Soviet Union in this scheme as havingspecial interests and security concerns in Eastern
and central Europe; he believed business could be
done with Stalin. In the conduct of that business,
Bevin’s lifelong experience as a negotiator helpedhim to appreciate when to be tactically aggressiveand when to be emollient. He did not wish to see
the wartime Allies split into Eastern and Western
blocs, and he was in any case suspicious of US poli-

cies. In speaking to Stalin in December 1945, hemade it clear that Britain’s intentions were peace-
ful, but that ‘there was a limit beyond which we
could not tolerate continued Soviet inﬁltration and

undermining of our position’.The hostility of Soviet propaganda until thesummer of 1946 was directed mainly againstBritain, with threats to Turkey and Iran and com-plaints about Allied policies in Germany souring
British relations with the Soviet Union. In March
1946, at Fulton, Missouri, Churchill delivered his
famous ‘Iron Curtain’ speech. He saw Britain inthe front line of halting communist expansion andsubversion beyond the Soviet Union’s own
acceptable sphere of power in Eastern Europe. He
was now trying to get the Americans to take these
threats seriously. Bevin also saw the Soviet threat
but he had not yet given up trying to persuadeStalin to work out problems cooperatively whileremaining ﬁrm towards him. A Western alliance
directed against the Soviet Union would only
provoke it, and Bevin regarded public condem-
nations such as Churchill had delivered ascounter-productive. Patient ﬁrmness was Bevin’spolicy until 1948; meanwhile his suspicions of the
Germans continued to play a considerable part in
his European outlook.334POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
Bevin’s main worry was that the US wouldcarry out its stated intention of completely with-drawing its military forces from Europe. He
therefore encouraged the French to play a role in
Germany as Britain’s ally, but the Anglo-French
relationship was not an easy one. After much dif-ficulty, particularly over the French desire todetach the Ruhr from Germany, something
Britain opposed, the Dunkirk Treaty of alliance
was concluded with the French on 4 March 1947.
Its terms were designed to meet the danger of
renewed German aggression, but it was alsointended to serve as the nucleus of a WesternEuropean grouping of nations without causing
offence to the Soviet Union and so ruining any
chance of future agreement and cooperation. The
grouping would strengthen social democracyinternally in Western Europe – after all, the com-munist parties were strong in both France and
Italy. In following this policy Britain provided the
important lead that two years later became the
sheet anchor of Western security, the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation.In 1947, Bevin was faced with two difﬁcult prob-lem areas on opposite shores of the Mediterranean
– Palestine and Greece. The intractable forces
problem of Palestine did more than anything elseto cast a shadow over his reputation and indeedover the morality of the whole of Britain’s attitude
to the persecuted Jews since before the war, when
the British government had restricted the entry to
Palestine of the Jews wishing to escape fromHitler’s Germany to no more than 75,000 over aperiod of ﬁve years. As a result fanatical Zionists
accused Britain of acting as an accomplice to the
Holocaust, though other countries, especially the
US, were even more reluctant to accept Jewish
refugees. During the war British warships hadpatrolled the Palestine coast and prevented escap-ing Jews from landing (the Jews were not inhu-
manely sent back, however, but were interned in
Mauritius). This set the secret Jewish militia, the
Haganah, against the British. More extremegroups, such as the Irgun Zwai Leumi (NationalMilitary Organisation) and a small terrorist group,
the Fighters for the Freedom of Israel (known as
the Stern Gang in Britain after their leader), beganattacking British policemen and installations in1943. In November 1944 the Stern Gang assassi-nated Lord Moyne, the British resident minister 
in Cairo. Nonetheless, the majority of Jews in
Palestine and those who lived in Allied countries
fought with Britain against the common enemy.While the great majority of Zionists con-
demned terrorism, British sympathies for the Jews
after the horrors they had suffered during the
Second World War were tempered by the effect
that terrorism against British soldiers had on
British opinion. One of the worst incidents wasthe blowing up on 22 July 1946 of the KingDavid Hotel in Jerusalem, which housed the
British army headquarters. Ninety-one people
were killed – forty-one Arabs, twenty-eight
British, seventeen Jews and ﬁve of other nation-alities. Another outrage that caused the deepestrevulsion was the hanging of two British sergeants
in ‘reprisal’ for the execution of two Irgun ter-
rorists. In all, some 300 people lost their lives as
a result of terrorism between August 1945 andSeptember 1947, almost half of them British.After the war, the British government was pil-loried for continuing to prevent large-scale immi-
gration of Jewish survivors interned in Europe.
Truman pressed for 100,000 entry permits, a plea
that Bevin condemned as cynical political pan-dering to American-Jewish voters. The newsreelsmeanwhile were showing ﬁlm of the Royal Navy
intercepting ramshackle boats overloaded with
refugees and forcibly detaining the ragged pas-
sengers.Britain’s policy was far from heroic but itshould not be saddled with all the blame for what
happened. The search for a peaceful settlement
between Arabs and Zionists had been going on
since before the war. It always ran into the same
blind alley. The Jews were not willing to live inan Arab state; they wished to create their ownstate in Palestine and to allow unrestricted access
to all Jews who wanted to come. This meant
some form of partition, which the Zionists would
accept. But the Arabs rejected the partition ofPalestine, so if partition was the only solution, itwould have to be imposed on the Arabs by mili-
tary force. Yet Britain was not willing to use its
troops to ﬁght the Arabs, given its widespread1BRITAIN AND THE WORLD335
interests in the Arab Middle East. In any case,why should Britain alone be made responsible forthe creation of a Jewish state in Palestine? It was
an international obligation.There was thus a certain logic when Britain inApril 1947 decided to end its thankless responsi-bilities and to hand them back to the UnitedNations, the successor of the international organ-
isation that had conferred the Mandate on Britain.
Britain gave the UN until 15 May 1948 to ﬁnd a
solution. But Bevin’s last hope, that the terminal
date of British rule in Palestine might, as in India,force the contending parties to the conferencetable, proved a vain one. Meanwhile Palestine
descended into civil war. It was not so much
Britain that seemed to abandon the Jews to the
apparently superior might of the Arabs surround-ing them, as the nations at the UN, which dulyvoted for partition but, just as Britain had done,
then left the Arabs and Jews to ﬁght out the con-
sequences. For the time being at least the British
had safeguarded their own interests in the MiddleEast, and the Americans had done the same.The need to safeguard British interests, in theMediterranean as well as the Middle East, also lay
behind the support for the royal Greek govern-

ment against the communists. It was largely due to
British intervention that Greece was not taken overby the communists after Germany withdrew inOctober 1944. The Greeks had fought the invad-

ing Italians and Germans courageously in 1940–1,
and had been defeated despite the spirited inter-

vention of British troops. In December 1944British troops returned, for Greece, with Turkey,occupied a vital strategic position in the eastern
Mediterranean. Stalin had accepted Western pre-

dominance in Greece and did not challenge 
the British directly, but communist Albanian,
Bulgarian and Yugoslav partisans provided aid tothe communist-led Greek National LiberationFront (EAM), with its military wing, ELAS. EAM
had earned the admiration of the Greek people by
their resistance to the Germans during the occupa-

tion. George II, the Greek king, was in exile with his government in Cairo. The majority of the Greek people did not wish to return to pre-
war political and social conditions, with the result
that EAM received wide support among non-communists. Opposed to EAM and ELAS wasanother, much smaller republican resistance group,EDES. Fighting broke out in Athens in December
1944. With the assistance of the British, EAM was
prevented from taking over the country. A truce
was patched up in January 1945, but it was to pro-
vide no more than a pause in the mounting tension(with atrocities committed by both sides) that led
to the outbreak of civil war in May 1946. Britain
insisted on elections in March 1946, but these
were boycotted by the left, so a right-wing gov-

ernment came to power and, with a plebiscite inhis favour in September 1946, the king returned toAthens. British troops continued their support, but
EAM retained strongholds in the devastated coun-

tryside.By the time of the king’s return the civil warhad begun. For a country that had already suf-fered so much from foreign occupation and star-
vation during the war, this was the crowning
tragedy. With the help of communist neighbours
Bulgaria, Albania and Yugoslavia, EAM was ableto continue the civil war for three years untilOctober 1949. The great majority of the Greek
people may have been in favour of change and
moderate left policies, but the country was being
destroyed by extremists.The civil war in Greece played a major role inthe post-war relations of the Second World WarAllies. The communist insurrection, it was
assumed, was being masterminded from Moscow.
As with later crises producing great international
tensions, the ‘domino theory’ was brought intoplay. It was suggested in London and Washingtonthat if Greece fell to communism the whole Near
East and part of North Africa as well were certain
to pass under Soviet inﬂuence. Bevin was in a
dilemma. He had no sympathy for the corrupt
royal Greek government and sensed that what theGreek people really wanted was social and polit-ical change. But his paramount motivation lay 
in his anti-communism. The foreign secretary
decided on a bold stroke to help rivet US atten-
tion on the Soviet threat in the Mediterraneanand at the same time relieve the ﬁnancial burdenon Britain. On 21 February 1947 he sent a
message to Washington that British economic aid
to Greece would have to be terminated by the336POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
end of March. Militarily the British actually con-tinued to support the royalist government untilthe communists were defeated in 1949. The US
stood in the ﬁnancial breach. This took the dra-
matic form of the Truman Doctrine announced
on 12 March 1947, which pledged American helpto defend the cause of the ‘free peoples’.The Truman Doctrine was followed in June1947 by the offer of Marshall Aid. Bevin prompt-
ly responded by concerting with the French a
positive Western European response. Stalin, on
the other hand, ordered the Eastern satellitenations to pull out of the conference in Pariswhich met from July to September 1947 to dis-
cuss the details of Marshall Aid. The division of
the East and West was becoming ever clearer, as
was America’s support for Western Europe. Butthis support still fell short of a ﬁrm military com-mitment, let alone an alliance. Thus in 1947,
despite its weakened state, Britain was still the
only major power that could be relied upon to
defend Western Europe.The breakdown in December 1947 of theLondon Foreign Ministers’ Conference on the
question of the future of Germany had ﬁnally
convinced a reluctant Bevin that priority would
have to be given to strengthening Western
Europe economically and militarily. The commu-nist coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 wasinterpreted in the West as signalling a new phase
of Soviet aggression. But Bevin was not willing to
place total reliance on an American readiness to
defend Western Europe and Western interests inthe Middle East and Asia. It was true that Britainand Western Europe were shielded by the
umbrella of the US monopoly of nuclear
weapons, but America had only a small stockpile
of atomic bombs and not until the Berlin crisis of
1948 were US bombers sent to Britain to act asdeterrent to the Soviet Union. So WesternEurope had to grasp the nettle of providing forits own defence. Bevin tackled this energetically.
The outcome of his diplomatic efforts was the
conclusion of the Brussels Treaty in March 1948,
an alliance between Britain, Belgium, theNetherlands, Luxembourg and France. Its aimswere not only to promote economic collaboration
in Western Europe; Article IV provided for mili-
tary assistance to any member of the alliance who
became ‘the object of an armed attack in Europe’.
Although the preamble of the treaty referred onlyto Germany as a potential enemy, the defensivealliance applied to any aggressor in Europe – and
the aggressor warned off in March 1948 was the
Soviet Union. Britain had now joined a Western
bloc and Bevin was its principal architect.The Labour government’s vision of acting as apeacemaker and mediator without exclusive
alliances with any one group of nations, a vision
that corresponded to a long tradition in British
foreign policy, had been abandoned by Bevin andthe Attlee Cabinet as the post-war dangers inher-ent in the Cold War became ever more apparent
in 1948. But it was only a partial abandonment.
Neither the Conservatives nor Labour intended
to join a united Western Europe, a supra-national
Europe. Britain’s alliances with its continentalneighbours were not exclusive: it valued its world-wide Commonwealth ties too highly. Bevin also
believed that Western Europe was not strong
enough to defend itself. For him, the Brussels
Treaty was a stepping stone to a wider transat-lantic alliance to be constructed when the US wasready for it. In the event, that was not to be until
1949, when NATO was created. Thus in a signiﬁ-
cant sense the British foreign secretary was a 
principal architect of the most important Western
post-war alliance.1BRITAIN AND THE WORLD337
The Nazi victories in Europe cast a long shadowover all the countries the Germans occupied. For
none is this more true than for France. Hitler had
allowed a French government to continue to func-
tion, and this Vichy regime under Marshal HenriPhilippe Pétain enjoyed the support of the great
majority of French people in 1940: for them the
war was over. Vichy represented adjustment to the
new realities and reconstructions, for the ‘old
France’ had demonstrated its rottenness in defeat.There appeared to be no real alternative to ‘honestcollaboration’, carrying out the terms the Germans
had imposed. But where did honour end? Vichy
militia and police helped the Germans to arrest
other French citizens to be handed over toGestapo torturers. Then the Jews were rounded upto be sent to their deaths in the east, not only the
foreign refugees admitted before the outbreak of
war, but French men, women and children. The
war produced great heroes in France: men and
women risking their lives for the persecuted, andfor the Allied cause. But there were tens of thou-
sands of French men and women who served Vichy
France, some in important roles, others in minor
capacities, from Pierre Laval, the prime minister to
the lowliest policeman or civil servant. They madetheir living serving the state, and the great major-
ity were able to continue their careers after the war,
with no apparent stain on their character.In France the situation changed only graduallyin de Gaulle’s favour, gaining added impetus afterthe German invasion of the Soviet Union in June1941. The strong French Communist Party nowreversed its policy of collaboration, and the resis-
tance, until then scattered and weak, now with
the adhesion of the communists developed into astrong movement. As the chances of Germanvictory receded with defeats in Russia and North
Africa and as the Nazis more and more ruthlessly
exploited the human resources of French labour,
forcing many Frenchmen to work in German fac-
tories, so support for Vichy dwindled. In 1943the various resistance groups agreed to combineand, looking to de Gaulle in London for leader-
ship, formed a National Council of Resistance
with the help of a Gaullist emissary parachuted to
France from England. Of course, this did notmean that all rival political ambitions had ended.While the communists ﬁxed their eyes not only
on liberation, but on a post-war communist trans-
formation of France, de Gaulle skilfully laid his
plans for frustrating them and for placing himself
at the head of a national government. This meantcontrolling the resistance movement and subor-dinating it to his own administration. With liber-
ation in 1944, the unity based on ﬁghting the
Germans came to an end, and France’s political
future stood shrouded in uncertainty. Would thecommunists take power? Would de Gaulle be ableto do so? Or would there be a civil war and an
Anglo-American occupation?In the event, millions of ordinary people werenow only too happy to identify with a Frenchhero and to rally around a new saviour to replaceChapter 29FRANCEA VEIL OVER THE PAST
the discredited 80-year-old Marshal Pétain. Withthe help of the BBC, de Gaulle had projected themyth of an unconquerable France, and he himself
ﬁtted the desired image. It was an extraordinary
feat, as he imbued the people with an inﬂexible
faith in France and in the recovery of its rightfulplace as a world power, thereby relegating 1940to no more than one defeat in battle that could
not alter France’s destiny. A gift for oratory
enabled de Gaulle to do for France what
Churchill had accomplished during the darkest
hours of the war for Britain. Politicians in Franceof all shades of belief, accepted de Gaulle as indis-pensable in the months immediately following the
expulsion of the Germans. On 26 August 1944,
in scenes preserved by the newsreel cameras, de
Gaulle strode through liberated Paris, withsnipers still ﬁring from the rooftops. Even so,largely because of American reluctance, the Allies
waited until October before granting full recog-
nition to de Gaulle’s provisional government.In the resistance movement, the communistswere the largest and most disciplined element.The socialists, as in Italy later, were divided on
the issue of whether or not to collaborate with
the Marxist communists in a broad-left front. The
president of the Resistance Council was Georges
Bidault, an anti-Marxist who identiﬁed with pro-gressive Catholic aims; he headed a new party, theMouvement Républicain Populaire (MRP) which,
after the communists and socialists, formed the
third and smallest group in the resistance. But de
Gaulle deliberately stood aloof from party politicsin 1944 and 1945, refusing to lead any party ofhis own; he claimed to speak for France above
parties. Yet, by stating as the aims of his policy
the restoration of national greatness and the polit-
ical, social and economic renovation of France, he
appealed to popular feelings on the left: liberationfrom the Germans would go hand in hand withreform. Big business, which had collaborated with
the Germans, and the conservative supporters of
Vichy, as well as all those who had done well
under German occupation, had to lie low polit-ically. Until the eve of liberation, supporters of deGaulle represented only a minority of the French;
after liberation they were able to lay claim to the
government without opposition.How did this come about? The communistswere on the spot, well armed and well organised.They had worked with the non-communist resis-
tance under de Gaulle’s aegis, but would they
now capitalise on their strong position in the
country to seize power? Again, as in Italy, thecommunists made no such bid to challenge deGaulle directly. Their leader, Maurice Thorez,
returned from Moscow in November 1944 and
gave his public approval to communist coopera-
tion with the other parties and their participa-
tion in a provisional government headed by deGaulle. The French communists, like the Italian,had probably received their instructions from
Moscow. The Germans were not yet defeated and
it was in Russia’s interest to maintain Allied unity.
An open attempt by communists to take powerin a Western country might alienate Britain andthe US. Stalin even thought that such an event
could open the way to a change of alliances, the
Western Allies siding with Germany against
Russia – his ultimate fear. De Gaulle succeededtherefore more easily than anyone expected. Theprovisional government was able to establish its
authority over the whole country, with the com-
munists securing only the less important minister-
ial posts. The independent local committees and
militia were dissolved without resistance. For twoyears, from 1944 to 1946, the communists par-ticipated in governments with the socialists and
the MRP. Despite their strength, the communists
could not dominate French politics in succeeding
years and were excluded from government. DeGaulle’s ﬁrst period of ofﬁce was short and endedin 1946, but he had already made a permanent
impact on French politics.During the ﬁrst year de Gaulle had acted cau-tiously at home. The obligatory trials of promi-
nent Vichy collaborators had taken place. TheVichy prime minister Pierre Laval was sentencedto death and executed, though Pétain’s death sen-
tence was commuted to life imprisonment.
Newsreels showed pictures of girls with heads
shaven as punishment for consorting withGermans. Wild summary ‘justice’ was meted outby the forces of liberation; this gave opportuni-
ties, too, for the simple settling of old scores. The
best estimate is that nearly 10,000 French were1FRANCE339
killed. Regularly constituted law courts passed7,037 sentences of death, but most received thepresidential pardon and only 767 executions were
actually carried out. Of the just over 167,000
tried, almost half were acquitted and 27,000
received jail sentences. So the prisons were ﬁlledwith collaborators. Even so, not all the Frenchcitizens who saw in Vichy a legitimate government
which they actively supported could be tried. After
1950, less than 5,000 remained in prison. The tri-
als ceased. They had been intended to cleanse
France from the Vichy taint. In fact, the only prac-tical policy was to draw a veil over the Vichy years,to conciliate and to unite the nation. It was left to
a few ardent individuals to continue to the present
day to uncover those responsible for Vichy crimes,
much to the embarrassment of some of the oldergeneration of Frenchmen. Somehow sleepingdogs will not lie; the whole war generation will
have to pass away ﬁrst.The provisional government after liberationwas faced with daunting problems of restoring thedislocated and shattered French economy. Therewere grave shortages of food and fuel. The infra-
structure of transport, bridges and railways had to
be rebuilt. State intervention and the takeover of
ailing industries were seen as necessary to enable
the nation to recover rather than as policies inconformity with socialist ideology. The provi-
sional government in 1945 responded to the
demands of the resistance and nationalised the big
banks, insurance, gas, electricity and coal as well
as companies which, like Renault, had collabor-ated with the Germans. This created the largestate sector of industry that has been characteris-
tic of post-war France. Joint committees were set
up in ﬁrms employing more than ﬁfty workers to
give employees a role and a stake in the success
of the company. But hopes for ‘industrial democ-racy’ were unfulﬁlled, because employers contin-ued to take the critical financial decisions.
Employees did, however, gain from the increase
of family beneﬁts and the introduction of com-
pulsory insurance. But this did little to relieve thegrim economic situation. Workers’ standards ofliving were under constant pressure from inﬂa-
tion. During the Vichy years (1940–4) retail
prices had risen more than three times but hourlywages had only doubled. At the end of the war,with too much paper money chasing too fewgoods, prices shot up. There was much industrial
unrest, made politically more dangerous because
the largest union, the Confédération Générale du
Travail (CGT), was controlled by the CommunistParty. De Gaulle rejected the restrictive monetarypolicy necessary to reduce the flood of paper
money held by the population and so defeat inﬂa-
tion and restore the value of the currency.
Instead, to maintain his popularity, he decreed
salary increases and simply postponed tacklingFrance’s economic problems.Nevertheless, de Gaulle’s greatest achievementmust be recognised. He stopped France from
sliding into a civil war between the active sup-
porters of Vichy, including the police and militiaon the one side, and the resistance on the other.Amid the chaos he used his enormous prestige as
the embodiment of France to impose a cen-

tralised, uniﬁed state on the warring factions.De Gaulle knew that, once the emergency waspast and the war was over, the provisional gov-ernment would need to be transformed into a
democratically elected one, and the provisional
state into a stable republic. Following a national
referendum held in October 1945, the French
people voted overwhelmingly for a new constitu-tion to be framed and for a constituent assemblyto be elected and given the task of drafting the
constitution. In the unique post-war circum-
stances the left gained more seats in the Assembly
than its usual electoral strength warranted, giventhat half the electorate tended to be conservative:the communists beneﬁted most with 160 seats,
and the socialists won 142. The new progressive
Catholic Party, the MRP, also did surprisingly
well, gaining 152 seats. The socialists and com-
munists thus achieved an absolute majority in theAssembly of 586 deputies.A deep rift soon opened up between de Gaulleand the majority in the Assembly on the question
of the future constitution. De Gaulle was clear
about the essentials: France must not relapse intothe political instability of the Third Republic. Hetherefore insisted on a strong executive headed by
the president, and on an assembly that would
have a share in government but should not be340POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
able to exercise sovereign power. Meanwhile, inthe Constituent Assembly the communists at-tempted to gain the agreement of the socialists to
a common programme that would exclude the
MRP, but the socialists, who held the key and had
no wish to be swallowed up by the communists,insisted on a three-party (communist, socialist,MRP) alignment. The communists chose to bide
their time, all parties agreeing to offer de Gaulle
the presidency. In the complicated political
manoeuvrings that followed, de Gaulle refused to
give the communists any of the key ministriesthey claimed – war, interior or foreign affairs –and threatened to resign. The socialists and MRP
supported him, and the communists, faced with
a choice of exclusion or participation, gave in. So
the ﬁrst round, with the critical help of the social-ists and MRP, went to de Gaulle. The politicalcrisis of November 1945 provoked by the com-
munist demands was thus resolved and a govern-
ment, headed by de Gaulle and comprising
ministers drawn from all the major parties, wasformed.But the fundamental issue remained to besettled: despite deep divisions between the social-
ists and communists in the Assembly, it became
clear that these two parties would reject de
Gaulle’s concept of a strong, independent presi-dency and executive in favour of leaving control-ling powers with a parliamentary assembly. In
many ways the Assembly was already asserting the
right to make judgements on the policies that de
Gaulle wished to adopt. On the constitutionalquestion de Gaulle could count only on thesupport of the MRP, and he reacted with bitter-
ness to the prospect of defeat in the Assembly.
He believed that he could rely on the support of
the mass of the French people. The politicians in
the Assembly, he was convinced, were combiningagainst him to safeguard their own selﬁsh inter-ests rather than those of France. Feeling nothing
but contempt for the parliamentarians, he decided
to force their hand. He conﬁded to one of his
ministers at this time:I don’t feel that I am made for this kind ofﬁght. I don’t want to be attacked, criticised,
challenged every day by men who have noother distinction than the fact that they gotthemselves elected in some little place inFrance. ... I can’t resign myself to enduring

criticisms of parties and irresponsible men, to
seeing my decisions challenged, my ministers
criticised, myself attacked, my prestige dimin-ished. Since I cannot govern as I wish, that isto say fully, rather than see my power dis-
membered, I’m going!That conversation took place shortly before deGaulle dropped his bombshell on 20 January1946 and resigned.His frustration and anger were genuine. All hispolicies abroad, in Germany, Indo-China and the
Middle East, had experienced setbacks as well.
But there was calculation too. He did not believethe nation would be able to manage without him.It was a tactical retreat and he expected to be
recalled on conditions he himself would set.
Several years later he acknowledged his miscalcu-
lation: ‘I have made at least one political mistakein my life: my departure in January 1946. Ithought the French would recall me quickly.
Because they didn’t do so, France wasted several
years.’After de Gaulle’s resignation, the French people– inﬂuenced by his opposition – rejected the draftconstitution in a referendum held in May 1946.
Then a second constituent assembly was elected
to draft an amended constitution. This gave
women the vote, adopted proportional represen-tation and created a second chamber but left thereal political power in the lower chamber, the
National Assembly, which also elected the presi-
dent. The constitution resembled in most import-
ant respects that of the Third Republic and was
to create the same governmental instability. Butdespite de Gaulle’s strong opposition the newconstitution was narrowly approved in a referen-
dum in October 1946, nearly 8 million dissent-
ing and just over 9 million in favour, with almost
a third of the electorate not bothering to vote atall. It was an inauspicious start for the FourthRepublic.The year 1947 was a particularly bad one forFrance. Food became still scarcer in the cities, and1FRANCE341
coal production fell. Prices doubled. Workerswhose real wages were rapidly diminishing cameout on strike, needing little encouragement from
the communist-controlled CGT. The Communist
Party found itself in the spring of 1947 faced with
a choice between remaining in the three-partygovernment (with the MRP and the socialists)which opposed the strikes, or supporting the
workers in their strike demands. Moreover,
France’s harsh policy of re-establishing its author-
ity over the colonies, and the developing Cold
War, made it increasingly difﬁcult for the com-munists to collaborate with their coalition part-ners. The socialist prime minister solved the
problem for them by dismissing the communist
ministers. Despite their hold over the trade
unions and their support among the electors, thecommunists could henceforth play only an oppo-sitional role in French politics and society. They
were not to regain a share of power in govern-
ment for thirty-four years.The stability of the Republic was also threat-
ened from the right. Admirers of de Gaulle weresecretly plotting to found a party as a vehicle for
the general’s early return. De Gaulle himself was
thinking along the same lines and began recruiting
supporters in the autumn of 1946 to set up a
national movement drawing support from all theFrench to ‘save France’. In April 1947, boosted bythe wave of strikes, he went public in a speech in
Strasbourg. He denounced the communists and
proclaimed his new movement, a kind of anti-
party party, calling for the ‘Rally of the FrenchPeople’ under the banner of his leadership, theRassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF).The question remained: if it was not a party,how would de Gaulle regain power under the con-
stitution? The answer was far from clear, except
that de Gaulle had no dictatorial intentions andwould accept the presidency only if offered it con-stitutionally. But the movement still looked dan-
gerously authoritarian, certainly unparliamentary,
given de Gaulle’s contempt for ‘rigid parties’ and
his call for an ‘orderly, concentrated state’. Hepromised that the movement would act within theframework of the law, but ‘over and above differ-
ences of opinion’, so that ‘the great effort of com-
mon salvation and the profound reform of thestate may be successfully undertaken’. It lookedfor a time as if de Gaulle would succeed, as mil-lions of the French were ready to support him dur-
ing that difﬁcult year. In the local elections in
October 40 per cent of the electorate gave their
vote to candidates of the RPF. But just four yearslater, in the elections for the new NationalAssembly in 1951, de Gaulle’s support had nearly
halved. The ‘Gaullists’ had become just another,
albeit strong, parliamentary group. The game was
up for the time being and two years later de Gaulle
withdrew to the village of Colombey-les-Deux-Églises.The economy of the Fourth Republic wasrecovering. A landmark in that recovery was the
adoption in January 1947 by the National Assem-
bly of what became known as the Monnet Plan. DeGaulle had appointed Jean Monnet after theLiberation to head a committee to prepare a plan
for the reconstruction and modernisation of the
French economy. Monnet’s roots were deeply
embedded in traditional France: he was born in1888 in Cognac into a family of brandy distillers.But he learnt to combine his understanding of
conservative France with the international expe-
rience he gained as a salesman for the cognac 
concern. In particular he was able to observe at 
ﬁrst hand the drive, ﬂexibility and efﬁciency of
twentieth-century America. His international per-
ceptions and idealistic belief in the betterment of
society through cooperation were heightened by
service for the League of Nations and the French
government before the outbreak of war in 1939.Monnet joined the Free French and came toBritain after the debacle of 1940; it was he who
suggested to Churchill the idea of an Anglo-
French union. In 1943 he became a member of the
French Committee of National Liberation, for
which he organised a group of experts. The workof his committee bore fruit in the plan he proposedin 1947. Monnet was to exert a lasting inﬂuence,

not only on French economic planning, but on 
the coordination of the West European economies
and the establishment of the Common Market.Drawing on his practical experience he passionatelybelieved that collective action, nationally and inter-

nationally, was necessary to solve the problems
confronting France and Europe.342POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
The plans produced by his Commission, theCommissariat Général du Plan, were not direc-tives, but targets and guides showing how the dif-
ferent elements of the economy could best be
coordinated in order to achieve the proposed
increases in production. Monnet had no intentionof controlling industry as was done in communistcountries. Much depended on his personal inﬂu-
ence. The nationalised industries provided a good
starting point because they were more amenable
to government planning, and Monnet’s Plan dealt
primarily with improving supplies of fuel andenergy, as well as with oil reﬁneries, transport,steel, cement and tractors to increase agricultural
productivity. The aim of the Plan was to raise
industrial and agricultural output by 25 per cent
over 1929 within three years. This would makepossible a substantial rise in the standard of living.It was presented as an emergency plan of action.
Instead it was to become a much more perma-
nent institution with a series of ﬁve-year plans.
The remarkable success of continuous economicplanning based on long-term objectives con-trasted with what appeared to be the hopelessly
inefﬁcient political scenario so characteristic of
France. This political instability led many to
underrate France’s fundamental strength.In world affairs, France had not won an equalplace with Britain in 1945. France’s German pol-
icy of attempting to detach the Rhineland and the
Ruhr achieved no success. The US and Britain
were coordinating and centralising WesternGermany, isolating France in its German occupa-tion zone. De Gaulle’s cherished hope of estab-
lishing France as a third force and as a bridge
between the Anglo-Saxons and the Russians,
which had led him to Moscow and to the conclu-
sion of a new treaty between France and the SovietUnion in 1944, was an idle dream. Stalin had nointention of using de Gaulle as an intermediary,
and the realities of the Cold War destroyed any
notions of French bridge-building. In reasserting
French colonial rights by the use of force inMadagascar, the Middle East, Algeria and Indo-China, France enmeshed itself in Third World
struggles for independence which, for more than
two decades, caused many deaths, bled France ofresources and weakened it at home and abroad,only to end in failure. Finally, 1947 was a year ofeconomic crisis and industrial unrest. Yet in retro-
spect, it was those very failures and difﬁculties that
turned French thoughts in new directions.French economic recovery was not possiblewithout German economic recovery and Franco-German cooperation. De Gaulle was the first
French statesman to offer the German people rec-
onciliation but it was on condition that they
became junior partners and accepted a weakened
German state deprived not only of the Saar butalso of the Rhineland and Ruhr, which would beinternationalised and formed into a separate
‘European’ state. But such aims were as much
opposed by the US and Britain as they were by
Germany. As conflicts with the Soviet Uniondeepened, so earlier anxieties receded. Germanywas likely to remain divided between the West
and the Soviet Union; control over armaments
and the Ruhr would continue in any case. But
West German support would have to be won: thismeant concessions and no further amputations ofGerman territory.For the governments of the French FourthRepublic it was, therefore, not so much a per-
ceived directRussian threat, the fear that Soviettanks would cross the Elbe and head for France,that provided the impetus for a change of policy;rather, it was the realisation that French aims in
continental Europe – dominance over Germany,
bridge-building to the east and maintenance of
French independence in the face of the AtlanticAnglo-Saxon powers – were doomed to failure asan indirect consequence of the Cold War. France
itself was now threatened with isolation as Britain
and the US chose to start building up West
Germany. France might, nevertheless, have taken
its time to change course had it not been for itsdire economic condition, which obliged the gov-ernment to rely on American aid.Internally and externally in 1947 pressures werethus mounting for a reorientation of French poli-

cies. There was soon tangible evidence that a newcourse was being followed. An Anglo-Frenchtreaty of alliance was concluded in March 1947
(the Treaty of Dunkirk) to reassure France as
Germany revived, and as a ﬁrst step towards closer
1FRANCE343
economic and political collaboration in WesternEurope. In June 1947, General George Marshall,the American secretary of state, delivered his
famous address at Harvard promising American aid
on condition that the European nations coordi-

nated their planning. His proposal was welcomedin France, and Anglo-French agreement on how toproceed followed speedily. On the initiative of the
French and British foreign ministers, Bidault and
Bevin, the European nations were invited to a con-

ference in Paris with the purpose of formulating
their responses to Marshall’s offer. West Germanywas included in Marshall’s Plan for European eco-
nomic cooperation (theoretically the German
Eastern zone, all the nations under Soviet control
and the Soviet Union were likewise included, but
they were expected to reject the conditions of aid).Acceptance of Marshall Aid was as essential forFrance as it was for the other Western nations if
recovery was to be accelerated. The Plan also held
out the hope that Western Europe might one day
be better able to maintain its independence fromUS inﬂuence. De Gaulle realised this as quickly asanyone and the Gaullists called for a EuropeanUnion based on a federation of states. Althoughtheir motivation and aims of policy were by no
means identical, the US, Britain and France found
their policies converging in 1947. Britain still saw
itself as separate from continental Europe but alsofavoured a strengthening of the Western continen-
tal states through collaboration.Thus, despite earlier differences, perhaps themost signiﬁcant outcome of the early post-war
years was not only the recovery of France, but the
drawing together of Western Europe underAnglo-French leadership with ﬁrm US support.The shape of the future Western Europe and the
broad Atlantic economic partnership had begun
to emerge in 1947. The shocks of the crisis years
1947 and 1948, the coup in Czechoslovakia andthe Berlin blockade, created a sense of commondanger which reinforced these ties, but Britain,
having ﬁrst provided a strong impetus, was to
draw back from closer economic cooperation with
the beginnings of West European integration inthe 1950s.344POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
Nazi Germany’s principal ally during the SecondWorld War was Benito Mussolini’s fascist Italy.
There had been much destruction, particularly of
housing, as the Allied armies pushed up theItalian peninsula after their landings in the south,but the country’s industrial north-east region,
where the Germans surrendered without severe
ﬁghting taking place, would allow Italian indus-
try to recover quickly. Agriculture too could be
brought back to normal within one or, at most,two seasons. The immediate dislocation caused by the war was, nevertheless, enormous. Even
though most Italian cities, unlike Germany’s, had
not been turned into rubble heaps, the standard
of living of most Italians had dropped to subsis-tence level and below. Communications andinfrastructure had to be rebuilt. Relief from
abroad was essential if the poorest Italian families
were not to starve, and it came principally from
the US. In 1945 Italy was producing less than
half of what had been its gross national productin 1938, yet three years after the end of the warthe Italian economy had already caught up with
pre-war levels.In many respects the Italians were in a morefortunate position than the Germans at the endof the war. Italy was not divided; it was occupiedand in reality under the control of the Western
Allies alone. The Allied perception of Italians,
reinforced by the way the war came to an end in
Italy, was far more favourable than their percep-tion of the Germans. At about the same time inthe autumn of 1944 as the Morgenthau Plan ofpastoralisation and minimal living standards was
being regarded as appropriate treatment for the
Germans, Britain and the US promised to helpItaly recover from the wounds of war. Why thegreat difference? Mussolini had presided over a
vicious puppet regime in northern Italy while the
Allies in 1944 were slowly battling up the Italian
peninsula. But the ﬁghting had not been left to
the Allies alone. A powerful anti-fascist partisanmovement had attacked and harried the Germantroops and the Italian fascist militia. In this way
the Italians had actively assisted in the liberation
of their country. The Germans had fought for
Hitler’s Germany to the end.The Allies had looked upon the fascists withcontempt rather than hatred during the war. The
Italian fascists, moreover, had not committed
atrocities on the terrible scale of the Germans.
Although Mussolini’s regime was increasingly
ready to accept German dictation, the Italianarmy high command during the Second WorldWar had not become as depraved as much of the
Wehrmacht leadership did; Italian generals had
even shown resistance to criminal orders. The
Italian people had tired of the war and genuinelywelcomed the British and American troops as lib-erators. The cause of Italy was also assisted by the
presence in the US of a large Italian-American
community whose members had not lost their
love for their homeland: Roosevelt wanted tosecure their support in the presidential election of1Chapter 30ITALY
THE ENEMY FORGIVEN1944. Most importantly, the Italians themselveshad overthrown Mussolini when the FascistGrand Council and the king had dismissed him.
The Allies were prepared to deal with his succes-
sor, Marshal Pietro Badoglio, even though he was
the brutal conqueror of Abyssinia; what matteredmost to them was that he was prepared to takeItaly out of the war. The Italians were thus
allowed by the Western Allies to change sides and
become ‘co-belligerents’ – not exactly allies, but
not enemies either.Italy had achieved something remarkable.Without a revolution the old fascist establishmentand the monarchy had transformed their fascist
rule to one acceptable to the Allies. To all intents
and purposes they had escaped the consequences
of the Allied demand for ‘unconditional surren-der’. As far as Italy was concerned, the needs ofwar overrode other considerations in Allied coun-
sels. For Churchill and the British, Badoglio and
the monarchy represented the best bulwark
against communism.The southern half of Italy had always been pre-dominantly conservative and royalist. With the
Allied armies in the south and the Germans in the
north, Italy was, in 1944, more physically split
than ever. In central and northern Italy a coalitionof anti-fascist parties was formed in September1944 embracing all anti-fascists from the Liberals
to Catholic Christian Democrats and from the
socialists to the communists. Calling themselves
the Committee of National Liberation, theydemanded war against the German occupiers. Bycontrast, the king and his government, who had
earned the contempt of many Italians by ﬂeeing
south to safety behind the Allied lines, seemed
paralysed and hesitant. The Committee of
National Liberation ﬁlled the vacuum and acteddecisively, despite the German occupation of cen-tral and northern Italy. For this reason it became
the effective political authority in Italy in 1945.With 250,000 armed partisans, a ﬁerce war wasfought in the north against the well-armedGerman divisions. The partisans suffered heavycasualties in 1944 and 1945 but succeeded in lib-
erating Milan and Italy’s other northern cities
even before Allied troops advancing from thesouth could reach them. Mussolini’s puppetregime in the north collapsed and he tried to ﬂee.He was captured by partisans and executed
together with his mistress. Their bodies were then
exposed to the savagery of public vengeance. The
newsreels that showed these horrible scenes,though they shocked many in the West, provideda glimpse of the passions the war had aroused.Why then did the communists not seek toexploit their organisational strength among the
partisans of the centre and north and their mili-
tary success in sweeping through the Po Valleyduring the spring of 1945, ‘the wind from thenorth’, to try to hold on to effective power?
Palmiro Togliatti, the communist leader, a cool
and calculating politician, had left Moscow and
reached southern Italy a year earlier, in March1944. He had immediately declared that the com-munists would collaborate with the royal govern-
ment and anti-fascist parties and he did not waver
from this course. It is probable that the strategy
had been coordinated in Moscow. The similaritywith the attitude of the French communists isstriking. Stalin was anxious to maintain Allied
unity until the war was won, and indeed after; he
had pressed for spheres of inﬂuence in the Europe
overrun by the Allied armies and he now tried to
demonstrate to the Western Allies that the com-munists in the sphere he accepted as Westernwould not be allowed to cause any trouble.
Realism, so Stalin believed, dictated that the
Western Allies, whose armies would conquer the
whole of Italy, would also decide future politicsin Italy. The Soviet recognition of Badoglio’sroyal government in the south in March 1944
sent this signal clearly. Stalin, of course, was also
anxious, as an obvious quid pro quo, to have the
Western Allies accept Soviet dominance in
Eastern and central Europe. Moscow, therefore,urged the communist parties of the West tofollow popular-front tactics, to bide their time
and to gain strength by working constitutionally
within the system.Togliatti too was committed to a policy ofcaution. An insurrection now would only havebeen crushed by the Allies; the path of legality,
on the other hand, guaranteed the survival of the
Communist Party, particularly when it was com-346POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
bined with the call that all Italians should uniteto defeat fascism and the Germans. Togliatti’saims were long-term, to rally the Italian masses to
an Italian Marxist line afterthe war, to establishwhat he enigmatically called ‘progressive democ-
racy’. The inevitable drawback of his policies wasthat by supporting the royal government he alsostrengthened the anti-communist forces which, as
it turned out, have dominated Italian politics ever
since 1945.The party in greatest difﬁculty after the warwas the ‘other party’ of the left, the socialists.Should it be ready now to unite the left, to gaina majority in the country and to collaborate with
the communists? It was led by Pietro Nenni, a
warm and popular ‘man of the people’ who
believed that it was the disunity of the workingclass that had allowed Mussolini and the fasciststo gain and retain power. Hence his decision after
1945 to urge close collaboration with the
Communist Party. This policy eventually split the
party in 1947, a majority following Nenni; aminority under Giuseppe Saragat distrustedMoscow and the communists, left the party on
this issue and formed their own party, the Social
Democrats.The Christian Democrats were to play the deci-sive role in post-war Italian politics. The principalaim of the party was to re-establish the constitu-tional parliamentary state of the pre-fascist era.
Fervour for reform varied among party members,
those on the left being the keenest. But the
Christian Democrats enjoyed one large electoraladvantage: the full backing of the Vatican. Theleader of the party, who dominated Italian politics
in the immediate post-war years was Alcide 
De Gasperi, a practising Catholic. Although not
solely a Catholic party, the Christian Democrats
depended on the support of the Church for theirelectoral success. Yet De Gasperi was no mere cap-tive of the Church. Despite Vatican disapproval he
was ready to work with the communists in the
National Liberation Council during the war and
he encouraged communist participation in thepost-war coalition governments until 1947. Itserved the interests of the governments he led
after December 1945 not to drive the communists
immediately into opposition.In post-war Italy the Church resumed its enor-mous inﬂuence over the lives of believers, theVatican and priests backing from their pulpits the
Christian Democrats against the godless commu-
nists. The Christian Democrats succeeded in
attracting by far the largest support of any oneparty. However, the alliance of Togliatti’s com-munists and of Nenni’s Socialist Party, both
strongly based in industrial northern and in
central Italy, obtained as much support as the
Christian Democrats but, with the Allies occupy-
ing Italy until the peace treaty was signed in1947, they had to content themselves with theposition of coalition partners in governments led
by the Christian Democrat De Gasperi. The com-
munists and their socialist allies were in any case
anxious to prove their good behaviour as a non-revolutionary political grouping. Dominating thereborn trade unions, the communists urged
restraint on the workers in the north, and at the
end of the war ensured that the partisans gave up
their arms, so ending any possibility of revolution.Were these tactics a betrayal of the working classand the revolution, as extreme-left theoreticians
later claimed? Revolution in the circumstances
prevailing in Italy was unlikely to have succeeded.
Stalin would have given no support. The over-
whelming strength of the Anglo-Americanarmies, the fact that the partisans were not allcommunists and their need for Allied supplies
against the Germans made the notion of a seizure
of power in 1944 and 1945 quite unrealistic.Despite the support the Church gave to themonarchy Italy became a republic in 1946, inresponse to a national referendum. The majority
for the republic had been slender, reﬂecting the
small preponderance of the left. A constituent
assembly was elected at the same time, with three
parties gaining most of the votes: the ChristianDemocrats secured 35 per cent, the socialistsnearly 21 per cent and the communists just under
19 per cent. The revived extreme right, quasi-
fascists, managed to obtain 5.3 per cent. On
crucial issues, communists and socialists behavedmoderately, so that a constitution setting up aparliamentary form of government was agreed on
in 1947. It left many issues ambiguous and would
allow the shift to the right to continue.1ITALY347
All three government parties collaborated onthe urgent task of post-war reconstruction; unem-ployment, rampant inflation and shortages of
food created enormous difﬁculties for the gov-
ernment and people of Italy. Flour was broughtin by the United Nations Relief and Rehabili-tation Administration (UNRRA), largely ﬁnanced
by the US. American emergency loans further
emphasised Italy’s dependence on the US.Reconstruction, it was held, must precede social-isation. The fascist economic controls over indus-
try were dismantled and private enterprise was
favoured over state-run industry by the orthodoxeconomists who dominated the treasury. Theyhad little faith in Keynesian interference in the
economy, after years of a corporate fascist state.
The trade unions won some relief for the workersagainst rising prices, but distress remained wide-spread, even though production picked up and
the yield of the 1946 harvest was better than that
of 1945. As elsewhere in Western Europe, thehard winter of 1946–7 caused a grave crisis inItaly. The ﬁrst two years after the war were a
period of great hardship for the Italian people,
with 1 million unemployed in industry alone. Itwas followed by an extraordinary upswing of pro-duction, which cannot simply be attributed to
Marshall Aid. It was dubbed an economic miracle,
but its foundations had been laid in the hard yearsafter the war. Conﬁdence in the currency wasrestored. The danger of a communist political and
economic takeover receded. De Gasperi under-
lined the waning need for communist and social-ist support when he excluded those parties fromhis new government in the spring of 1947. With
their departure the last vestiges of the wartime
Committee of National Liberation vanished. The
politics of war, of possible revolutionary change,were over and Italy was returning to a kind ofnormality. Thus in little more than two years a
certain political stability had been attained, and
vital issues such as the future control of industry,the monarch and the role of the Catholic Churchhad all been deﬁned.No former enemy was quite so rapidly forgivennor so speedily embraced as a new ally as was Italy.In February 1947, unlike Germany, Italy secured
a peace treaty. The loss of its colonies appeared aheavy blow at the time, but later it was to spareItaly the trauma of decolonisation suffered by thevictors. The Western Allies demanded no repara-

tions, and those paid to the injured victims in the
Balkans and the USSR were kept to a modest
level, funded by grants and loans supplied by theUS. Yet the Italians did not escape entirelyunscathed. Besides losing their colonial territories,
Italy also had to give up Albania and its wartime
Balkan gains. The most bitterly disputed territory
was the province of Venezia Giulia, until 1918
part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, its port ofTrieste populated predominantly by Italians. Italyhad had little to show for its heavy losses in the
First World War, and its 1918 gains had enormous
emotional signiﬁcance. But the Yugoslavs, who

had suffered so much from German and Italianoccupation, were in 1954 granted most of the ter-
ritory by the wartime Allies, the Italians regaining
control only of the city of Trieste itself, which was
made a free territory.Of great economic, as well as national andemotional, importance was another former Habs-burg territory, the South Tyrol, its predominantly
German-speaking population antagonised by
Italian rule. The Italians had gained this territory
with the blood of more than 1 million war dead
in the Great War. They would not now lightlygive up the Brenner Pass frontier or the hydro-electric power they had developed in this region.
The Allies in 1946 rejected Austrian claims, not
to mention the wishes of the majority of the pop-
ulation. The Italians were far from satisﬁed withthe peace terms. They claimed that, havingchanged sides in 1943, they should have been
better treated.The Russians consented to the peace treaty,which might appear surprising in the Cold War
climate of 1947. But the treaty also marked thelogical outcome of the Yalta Agreements. Theoccupying powers’ decisions were not to be chal-
lenged in the spheres of inﬂuence recognised by
the Soviets. In return for agreeing to the Italian
terms, the satellite regimes in Soviet-controlledBulgaria, Romania and Hungary received recog-nition and peace treaties at the same time, as also
did Finland. Their gains and territorial adjust-

ments as allies of Germany were reversed, but the348POST-WAR EUROPE, 1945–7
Soviet Union retained Bessarabia (Moldavia) andnorthern Bukovina, which they had ﬁrst occupiedin 1940. Finland had to conﬁrm the cession of
territory made to the USSR in 1940, and the
Soviet Union in addition secured a ﬁfty-year lease
of the Porkkala naval base. Unlike the Balkanstates, Finland never became a satellite and wasallowed complete independence while following a
policy friendly to the USSR. Relations proved so
satisfactory that the Soviets returned the naval
base in 1955.From the start Italy was not treated asGermany was. Even under American occupationfrom 1945 to 1947, the military supervisory gov-ernment dropped the word ‘Control’ from its titleof Allied Commission. Fascism was suppressed,
but political life never came to a standstill. After
the peace treaty, Italy participated on the same
terms as France and Britain in the Marshall Plan(though receiving much less) and could take itsplace in the United Nations. Italy had been
treated generously, and harboured no grudges
against the nations that had defeated it. Italians
escaped too the heavy burden of guilt that would
continue to haunt the German people for morethan a generation.1ITALY349

THE UNITED STATES AND THE
BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR,
1945–8As seen from Europe during the ﬁrst post-waryears, the US was a land of plenty. The GIs, when
they came to London or Paris, looked remark-
ably well fed and groomed, quite different toEuropeans in their fourth year of war. The fabledUS army stores, the PXs, were ﬁlled with candy,
cigarettes, lighters, watches, pens – everything
that was in such short supply for the Europeans
was available to the US troops in abundance. The
image of wealth was reinforced by the dreamkitchens and cars shown in Hollywood ﬁlms. Butthese were false impressions. The life of John Doe
did not match the celluloid representation.At home Americans, too, faced shortages, andindustrial dislocation as the country after 1945turned from the needs of war to those of peace.Worst off were the 20 million black citizens. They
had already experienced discrimination in the
army while ﬁghting the ‘crusade for freedom’.
Now they were not willing to accept the condi-
tions of ghetto housing or the prejudices and dis-crimination of the Deep South, where they weredeprived of basic civil rights and prevented from
voting by such subterfuges as the notorious 
‘literacy tests’. Southern juries, moreover, were 
overwhelmingly selected from white citizens;indeed, the chance of securing genuine equalitybefore the law was not easy for non-whites 
to attain in the US in 1945. Segregation was
common in restaurants and diners, and on trans-
portation. In education, black children in South-ern states attended inferior black schools. Evenoccasional lynchings were still occurring in theDeep South. African American citizens could well
ask themselves: ‘What were we ﬁghting for?’But there were both black and white citizenswho wanted to right these wrongs. The long-established National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People began to win some
signiﬁcant legal battles. But the struggle for civil
rights proved long and hard. President Harry 
S. Truman, at ﬁrst cautiously, then more boldly,took his stand on the issue. His motives were bothaltruistic and practical. The African American vote
was increasingly important as black people became
more involved in politics and their support was
moving from the Democrats to the Republicans.Truman had to destroy the impression that oncivil rights his party was dominated by the
Southern Democratic wing. Yet he could not 
persuade Congress to pass civil rights legislation.
The evidence of his concern was the setting up 
of a Committee on Civil Rights.Not all white Americans were well-to-doeither, as the European GI brides discovered
when their husbands took off their uniforms. But
the war had brought full employment to the US.
The GI Bill of Rights provided federal grantswhich gave to ordinary Americans opportunitiesto advance themselves in education and to acquire
new skills. Army gratuities enabled many a new
small business to be started or a home to be built.
The average American was better off than everbefore. But would the boom be as short-lived as1Chapter 31THE UNITED STATES
A RELUCTANT WORLD POWER
that which followed the First World War? WouldRoosevelt’s New Deal and its network of beneﬁtsfor those in need survive the death of its beget-
ter? There was strong Republican resistance to the
New Deal and to federal interference in industrial
relations and social welfare. The New Deal,Republican Senator Taft claimed, was taking awayindependence and enterprise from the American
people and substituting government paternalism.
Up and down the country he preached: ‘We have
got to break with the corrupting idea that we can
legislate prosperity, equality, and opportunity. Allof these good things came in the past from freeAmericans freely working out their destiny.’
Roosevelt and what he stood for were denounced
by conservative Americans with a vehemence that
approached hatred.Which way would America now turn? Theanswer was by no means clear and Truman,
Roosevelt’s successor, seemed to hesitate and
fumble, overwhelmed by the size of the task that
had unexpectedly fallen on his shoulders. Theimmediate problem facing the US, as everywhereelse, was to convert the economy to peacetime
conditions. Should wartime controls of prices and
wages continue? Inﬂation was gathering pace, too
much money was chasing too few goods. Workers
demanded wage increases to keep up with pricerises. By inclination Truman was a New Dealer,believing that some federal intervention was essen-
tial to protect the vast majority of less well-off
Americans, yet he also thought that government
controls as established in wartime should bereduced, especially the many regulations holdingdown prices. Throughout 1945 and 1946, price
controls were progressively relaxed. One conse-
quence was that organised labour demanded an
end to wage controls. The crunch came when the
powerful United Automobile Union went onstrike against General Motors to gain wage risesthat would maintain the workers’ standard of liv-
ing. Then in April 1946 the redoubtable John L.
Lewis led 400,000 coal miners on strike. The fol-
lowing month the locomotive engineers wereready to bring the railway system to a halt.Truman reacted as if this was a declaration of war,
threatening as commander-in-chief to draft into
the army all workers ‘who are on strike againsttheir government’. The rail strike was called off.Nevertheless, wages were inevitably rising fast asthe controls proved to be increasingly leaky. But
Truman had demonstrated that he was prepared
to use the presidency and federal powers against
any group which in his judgement was actingagainst the national interest.In the making of policy much depends on thedegree of collaboration achieved between the
president and Congress. In September 1945,
Truman enjoyed in the Seventy-Ninth Congress
a Democratic majority in both the House and theSenate. But the Democratic Party lacked cohesionmore than the Republicans did, the Southern
Democrats aligning themselves with the conserv-
ative Republicans on many domestic issues. There
was thus a majority of anti-New Dealers inCongress. Truman drew on his experience in theSenate to cultivate good relations with Capitol
Hill. In his ﬁrst message to Congress, outlining
the twenty-one points of his administration’s pro-
gramme, he steered a moderate course, but heincluded some New Deal policy proposals forunemployment compensation supplementation, a
commitment to full employment and assistance
for black people and other minorities. Truman
was only partially successful. On civil rights issues,
the alliance of Southern Democrats and conserv-ative Republicans proved a virtually insuperableobstacle.Truman’s single biggest failure was his inabil-ity to check inﬂation. Wartime controls had been
abandoned too quickly to stop the spiral of pricerises and wage demands backed by cripplingstrikes. Congress blamed Truman, and Truman
blamed Congress. The decline of Truman’s pop-
ularity made itself felt during the elections in
November 1946 for the Eightieth Congress. The
Democrats lost heavily, and the Republicans nowgained majorities in both the Senate and theHouse. A Democratic president and a Republican
Congress could easily lead to recrimination and
paralysis in government, bad for the US and bad
for a Western world looking for American helpand leadership. On domestic questions, Congressand the president found themselves at logger-

heads. Taft and the conservatives dominated the
Eightieth Congress, and their nominees chairing354THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8
the crucial Senate committees set out to pushback the frontiers of the New Deal. Income taxwas redistributed to favour the better off; pro-
posals for more federal help for farmers, for public
housing, for education and for additional social
security were rejected. Taft set his sights on‘straightening out domestic affairs’. The mostimportant measure of 1947 was probably the
Taft–Hartley Act, which limited union power.
The strike record of the unions and the disrup-
tion they had caused made this acceptable outside
the circles of organised labour, and Truman’s vetoof the bill was overridden by Congress.Yet, despite undoubted problems, the US econ-
omy passed successfully from war to peace. The
post-war depression that many Americans feared,
repeating the historical experience after 1919, didnot occur. There was a clamour for houses, furni-
ture, consumer goods and cars. In Europe, unable
to produce what it needed, there was a great
demand for American exports. Some unemploy-

ment persisted in the US but the great majority ofthe millions demobilised from the armed servicesfound work. American industry took up the slack
left by the fall-off of wartime production, and 
during the post-war years from 1945 to 1949
Americans enjoyed growing prosperity.It was perhaps natural that the Americanpeople should now wish to get on with their livesat home. Most of them felt that they had settled
the world’s problems. They were aware of great
hardships suffered in Europe and as individuals
responded generously, despatching food parcelsthrough organisations set up to care for theneedy. But to pay taxes and then have Congress
vote huge sums as gifts to the rest of the world
while there were still plenty of urban slums and
much real poverty at home, was a different
matter. Should charity not begin at home?Something akin to the sacriﬁcial spirit of wartimewould be needed to alter these attitudes. The
spectre of communism eventually provided the
motivation, but not in 1945, when the Russians
were still regarded by most of the Americanpeople as valiant allies. Congress, too, reﬂected adesire to get back to normal times as fast as pos-
sible and to reduce America’s huge wartime com-
mitments. With the end of the war against Japan,the administration suddenly cancelled the Lend-Lease arrangements. Special measures were justi-ﬁed in war but not in peace. Yet ﬁnancial experts
in Washington were perfectly aware that interim
measures would be necessary to smooth the
passage from war to peace. A blueprint for post-war international finance and trade had beenworked out at Bretton Woods from 1944 based
on freeing trade and currencies from restric-
tions. But how to get there, given the imbalance
between the American and European economies?The US in 1946 exported twice as much as itimported; its exports were now three times aslarge as in 1939. The exports of France and the
rest of Europe combined amounted to less than
half the imports to these countries from the US.
Italy, Germany and Japan had been crushed bythe war, and their import needs, to maintain eventhe lowest standards of living, exceeded their
exporting capacity. There was clearly a huge trade
imbalance. Western Europe faced penury, and
hopes of a better life depended on the US.Eastern Europe also received relief throughUNRRA until 1946, but then East and West
parted company, and the Soviet Union and the
nations under its control faced the daunting task
of recovery without American assistance. The gap
between progress in the two halves of Europewidened in 1945 and communist mismanagementcontinued to increase the differences in the era
from 1945 to the 1990s.Only the US now had the ﬁnancial capacity tobecome the world’s banker and to recycle throughloans and gifts the huge surpluses America’sfavourable balance of trade earned it. The war had
greatly increased the US’s productive capacity,
and to a lesser extent that of Canada; the needs of
Americans at home and worldwide shortages pro-
vided the market for them. American ﬁnancial pol-icy responded with enlightened self-interest. Newloans were negotiated on generous ﬁnancial terms
so that goods being shipped from the US could be
paid for. But the US wished to return to normal
commercial practice as soon as possible. Americanﬁnancial advisers were no doubt too optimisticabout the timetable of West European recovery
and thought special assistance would be needed
for only two or three years. In their desire to move1THE UNITED STATES355
quickly towards conditions of freer trade andunimpeded currency exchanges in order to avoid a repetition of the 1930s, the Americans attach-
ed conditions to their loans which the West
European economies were unable to meet when
called upon to do so in 1947. Far more helpwould then be needed.The void left by Roosevelt’s death was felt evenmore deeply when it came to chart the course the
US should pursue in world affairs than it was in
domestic affairs. Roosevelt had followed what atﬁrst glance appeared to be contradictory aims.The strong support the US gave to the setting up
of the United Nations and the freeing of inter-
national trade involved a global commitment to a
peaceful world. The inevitable conﬂicts would behandled and resolved peacefully in the worldforum of the UN. Simultaneously Roosevelt
strove to maintain the wartime alliance of the Big
Four, the Soviet Union, the US, Britain and
China. Each of the Big Four would be responsi-ble for peace and security in its own part of theworld. Roosevelt set great store by personal diplo-
macy, developing friendly relations with Stalin
and Churchill. He was ready to deal with Stalin
directly, to the discomfort of his British ally; but
when there was a need to check Stalin he wouldacknowledge and emphasise the ‘special relation-ship’ that existed between Britain and the US. He
was opposed to colonialism and he looked
forward to a gradual transformation of the
European colonial rule in Asia, the Middle Eastand Africa with his country’s benevolent encour-agement, but these were ideals that could not
easily be put into practice without losing the con-
ﬁdence and support of the West European states.
The problem of what to do about China already
loomed large in 1945, with the Nationalists underChiang Kai-shek facing the well-entrenchedCommunists led by Mao Zedong in a struggle for
the control of China. Roosevelt’s aim was to unite
the two hostile sides against the Japanese invaders
by persuading the Communists to subordinatethemselves to the Nationalists – a hopelesslyimpractical endeavour.Roosevelt had deliberately avoided any coher-ent detailed master plan to guide American policyin the post-war world. He was a pragmatist.Events would decide the degree of emphasis tobe placed on one tactic or another so that they
might complement each other in a workable way.
The handling of the various policy threads would
thus require a virtuoso in the White House, constantly adjusting a policy here while trying out new initiatives somewhere else. Whether
Roosevelt could have handled the problems as
successfully as he supposed must be doubted.But the clash did not seem inevitable in 1945or 1946. An early ‘hot’ war was not expectedeither in Moscow or in Washington. No thoughtwas as yet given to building up rival armies or
alliances to meet such an eventuality. The US
after victory on the battleﬁelds wished to bring its
troops home from Europe and Asia as quickly aspossible. The army, navy and air force were mas-sively demobilised; aircraft, warships and tanks
when not actually broken up were mothballed or
left rusting in ﬁelds and creeks. Roosevelt and
Truman felt it safe to rely on America’s nuclearmonopoly. The American people wanted toreturn without undue delay to normality. They
were not prepared to pay higher taxes for large
armed forces in peacetime, and Truman for
reasons of domestic policies wanted to balance
the budget. Occupation troops in Germany andJapan were kept at the lowest level consistent withinternal security. Assistance to former allies was
limited to economic aid, to loans and goods, and,
in the case of Nationalist China, to weapons.
Truman talked tough and gave an outragedSoviet Foreign Minister Molotov a dressing downin April 1945. But, in what became the Soviet
‘sphere’ in Eastern and central Europe, the US
and Western Europe had neither the means nor
the will to interfere effectively; all they could do
was to refrain for a short time from recognisingthe Soviet-created governments.Truman’s experience of world affairs waslimited. On the complex questions confronting
the US in the spring and summer of 1945, he
tried to follow through Roosevelt’s policies. Butthe counsels of his principal advisers were divided.The most important issue was whether to con-
front Russia or to try to arrive at some working
arrangement with Stalin over disputed issues such356THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8
as the future of Germany, agreements that wouldallow East and West to accept each other’s dif-ferences and yet be able to live side by side. The
future of Poland, and Stalin’s determination to
secure a ‘friendly’ neighbour here on his own
terms, soured relations from the start. But if theUnited Nations could be set up, a world forumfor resolving conﬂicts might settle current and
future problems of this kind.The conference called to draft the UN Chartermet at San Francisco in April 1945. Vital differ-
ences still remained. The United Nations mightyet founder. The US was the keenest proponentof setting up the world organisation and that this
was accomplished by the end of June 1945 was
the most important diplomatic success of the early
months of the Truman administration.It was of course clear that the United Nationswould not be a ‘world government’. Its members
remained sovereign nations. The decision-making
procedure, however, would be based on the
Western democratic process of the majority vote,which would place the Soviet Union and its asso-ciates in a minority. Therefore the nub of the
problem became how far any nation would have
to accept a decision by majority vote. Clearly
nations were not equal in size or power, nor did
they share the same ideals of government. Theinequality of states had to be recognised by givingto what were then regarded as the most import-
ant nations – the Soviet Union, the US, China,
Britain and, sentimentally, France – a special
status; they were to be the permanent membersof the Security Council; a number of smallerstates, six in 1945, were then elected by the
General Assembly of the UN to the Security
Council to join the ﬁve permanent members for
a ﬁxed period. All the founding member nations,
fifty-one in 1945, were also members of theGeneral Assembly.But this division of General Assembly andSecurity Council did not solve the problem. The
Soviet Union in particular wished to restrict the
UN’s powers to interfere in case its vital interestswere affected, and it was clear that in votingstrength in both the General Assembly and the
Security Council the US and the West could be
certain of majorities. Nevertheless the US andBritain did share one interest with the SovietUnion and that was to give themselves a specialstatus; the ﬁve permanent members were therefore
each given the right of a veto. The wrangling at
San Francisco, where Molotov earned a reputation
for dour negativity, concerned how far this rightof veto should extend – whether it should extendto practically everything or only to proposals to
enforce decisions of the United Nations. Molotov
wished to be able to veto even mere discussion of
problems. A complicated formula, full of ambigu-
ities, was eventually evolved to determine when aveto could or could not be exercised by a perma-nent member. There was no doubt, however, that
any one of the permanent members of the Security
Council could stop military action or any other
form of sanction by the exercise of a veto.Perhaps the limitations placed on UN powersin the end saved the organisation, for how oth-
erwise could nations in conﬂict have continued to
belong to it? The conﬁdence reposed in the UN
early on, by public fervour in the West, express-ing the faith that it could solve the world’s prob-lems by diplomacy and debate, was misplaced.
The Russians were more realistic in their assess-
ment of what a United Nations based in New
York meant from their point of view. It was there-
fore remarkable that they agreed at all and thatthe Charter of the UN was unanimously adoptedon 25 June 1945. The United Nations over the
years did prove itself a signiﬁcant tool for the set-
tling of problems, negotiations being conducted
as often in the corridors and coffee bars as inpublic debate. The United Nations thus served asan important adjunct to the channels of inter-
national diplomacy. Sometimes in disputes coun-
tries have indeed used the UN as the principal
forum of negotiation, but at other times they
have bypassed it altogether.Truman’s UN policy was as successful as the Westcould have hoped. But American expectations
were not fulﬁlled in China. During the Second
World War, the Chinese people and their leaderGeneralissimo Chiang Kai-shek were built up asheroic allies. Pro-Chinese sentiments had been
strong in the US for decades as long as the
Chinese people remained in China and did not1THE UNITED STATES357
emigrate to the US. Something of a special rela-tionship had developed. China became the princi-pal preoccupation of American missionaries, who
maintained an inﬂuential lobby in Washington. As
for American business relations with China, they
were as old as the American republic itself. ThusChina loomed large in America’s consciousness.Truman continued Roosevelt’s policy of medi-ation between the Nationalists and communists
but not on the basis of equality for both sides. The
Americans tried to persuade the communists to be
satisfied with a junior participating role in aNationalist Chinese government, subordinatingthe communist army divisions to a Nationalist
supreme command. At the same time, despite the
corruption of Chiang’s rule and that of his party,
the Kuomintang, the US backed Chiang withweapons and logistical support. In Washington itwas thought that civil war might still be avoided.
The true strength of the communists was under-
estimated in Washington during 1945 and 1946.
The Soviet Union, too, wished to prevent an openconﬂict breaking out in China in 1945 and so wasready to recognise and cooperate with the
Nationalist regime. Nevertheless, this did not
inhibit the Soviets, when they evacuated northern
China and Manchuria, from giving the local com-
munists assistance in the expectation that theywould take their place. The US meanwhile pro-vided massive support for Chiang Kai-shek’s
forces. At the end of the war the Americans trans-
ported nearly half a million Nationalist troops by
air and sea to the north to put them in place in theregions vacated by the Japanese before the com-munists could get there. There was also a direct
military intervention by the US when 53,000
marines were landed to occupy key areas in north-
ern China. Confrontation in northern China
became inevitable as the Nationalists increasinglyclashed with communist forces, who had theadvantage of ﬁghting close to their bases whereas
the Nationalists were hundreds of miles from
theirs.From 1945 to 1949 the US shipped largequantities of arms to China’s Nationalist forces tohelp them gain control of the whole of China.
But, to begin with, US policy aims were ﬁne

tuned. Chiang was not to receive so much mili-tary support that he should feel conﬁdent aboutdiscarding his American advisers and Americanmediation efforts and so start an all-out civil war,
yet he was to be given sufﬁcient arms to bring
Mao to the conference table. In this way the
Americans wished to induce the communists tomerge with Chiang’s government.General George Marshall, America’s most dis-tinguished soldier of the Second World War, was
sent out by Truman to mediate in January 1946.
He spent a fruitless year in China. He succeeded
in bringing Chiang and Mao Zedong to thenegotiating table, and to all appearances theyeven came close to agreement. But appearances
hid the realities. Neither Chiang nor Mao was
ready to compromise his position; both sought
total control of China. Mao did not thinkAmerican hostility was inevitable; both leaderswished to be able to persuade Washington that
the failure of mediation was due to the intransi-
gence of the other side.Mao’s faith in ultimate victory was remarkable.Although in 1945, 100 million Chinese livedunder Communist Party leadership, the commu-
nists were still numerically far weaker than the
Nationalists, whose army outnumbered theirs by
four to one. If it came to war, the US expected
Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist forces to beat thecommunists in the long run, but more damagewould be inflicted on China. The Americans
urged Chiang to reform the corrupt Kuomintang
regime and to make his government more accept-
able to the people of China. But in the summer of1946 full-scale ﬁghting broke out for control ofnorth-eastern China in the wake of the Soviet
withdrawal. Advice and military aid was showered
on Chiang but simultaneously the Americans dis-
engaged themselves from direct involvement. The
American marines were withdrawn, and theTruman administration concluded that if Chiang’sregime could not be saved by aid, the alternative
of a massive US military commitment in China
was simply out of the question. The rival Chinese
forces would have to be left to decide the fate ofChina. This was a sensible view, showing that theTruman administration had a sense of the limita-
tions of American power in the world. If at the
same time in Washington a more balanced view358THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8
had been taken of the Chinese communists, if it had been understood that the communists toowere nationalists and that relations between
Moscow and Beijing were full of ambiguities, then
a more realistic China policy might have emerged.The restoration of a friendly China as a greatpower – one of the Big Four – a China linked tothe West, had been an essential cornerstone of
Roosevelt’s cherished concept of an orderly and
peaceful post-war world. China, so he intended,
would help the US to maintain peace in Asia and
the Paciﬁc and hold Japan in check. Inevitably,Japan would one day recover and, against that day,it was to be China’s role to prevent another round
of Japanese aggression. The Chinese people, in
contrast to the Japanese, were broadly perceived as
humane and civilised, worthy allies in the cause offreedom. But during the ‘decisive years’ (1945–50) quite a different post-war world in Asia took
shape. Communist China became the enemy, and
Japan the indispensable base in Asia of the free
world.During the war Japanese behaviour was judged byAllied governments and peoples to have been even
worse than that of the German National Socialists.
In one important respect, as far as the Western
Allied nations were concerned, the Americans, theBritish and the Dutch, this was true: the Japanesehad treated captured prisoners of war with barbar-
ity, many thousands perishing from starvation and
overwork. In China, Japanese cruelty inflicted
horrors indiscriminately on civilians and soldierswhich had shocked the civilised world when theChina war began in 1937, at a time when the rest
of the world – except for Spain – was then still at
peace and still shockable. These anti-Japanese per-
ceptions were reinforced by long-held Western
attitudes of racial superiority. The Japanesepeople, like the German people, would be made tosubmit totally, and could not be trusted. Henry
Morgenthau’s treasury had drawn up a punitive
plan for the post-war treatment not only of
Germany but also of Japan. It was at ﬁrst expectedthat Japan would need to be occupied and theJapanese ruled for a long time, not so much for
their own good, but to safeguard the world from
their aggressive and barbarous impulses.Despite unconditional surrender, the trial ofwar criminals and the purging of thousands frompositions of inﬂuence in Germany and Japan, the
history of the occupation in the two countries
nevertheless developed differently in one import-
ant respect. Although Japan was stripped of all itsoverseas conquests acquired since its war withChina in 1894, the Japanese homeland was not
divided into separate Allied zones of occupation
but remained a whole nation. Above all, the entry
of the Soviet Union into the war only a few days
before Japan’s surrender and the fact that noSoviet military forces set foot on the main islandsof Japan, meant that West–East disputes about
the post-war treatment of Japan were contained
on the purely diplomatic level. The Russians were
represented on the Far Eastern Commission inWashington, and a Russian general was sent tothe impotent Allied Council in Tokyo, but all 
real power remained in American hands, and
American troops supplied the bulk of the occu-
pation forces. In Tokyo that power was exercisedby one man, a war hero who was already a legendin his lifetime, General Douglas MacArthur,
Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers for
the Occupation and Control of Japan, SCAP for
short. MacArthur was pretty well able to do what
he wished. In the immediate post-war years theproblem regions of the world that commandedthe anxious attention of Washington, London
and Moscow were Europe and China. It was in
these regions that the well-publicised crises were
occurring, the European ones appearing evenmore urgent and menacing than the cataclysmicchanges in China. Japan had seemingly become a
backwater. General MacArthur’s high-handedness
in settling occupation policies without paying
much attention to his superiors in Washington or
to the other Allied governments caused irritation,but, as long as Japan did not become an addedproblem, matters were left in his hands. It would
certainly have been hazardous to tangle with a
living legend, who, although he did not regard
himself as semi-divine, thus usurping the formerdivinity of Emperor Hirohito, did see himself as the benevolent guide of the Japanese people,
on whose shoulders the shaping of their destiny
had fallen. He was determined to break up the1THE UNITED STATES359
pre-war feudal structure of Japanese society, todeprive the military-aristocratic and business elitethat had run Japan before 1945 of all power, to
ban notions of future military conquests from
Japanese minds and to democratise Japan by
order from above.General MacArthur’s supreme command,which ended with his dismissal in 1951, has
remained in many respects a controversial period
of Japanese history. Was his impact as great as 
he assumed or did the Japanese continue to
control their own development more than issupposed? Would many changes have occurredjust the same without the autocratic MacArthur?
Was Americanisation just skin-deep, a matter of
outward form, while the essence of the Japanese
spirit remained intact? Such questions stimulatethought, but the reality is not so polarised. Ofcourse, Japanese institutions and Japanese atti-
tudes persisted, but defeat by the West had made
an enormous impact.Japan was the ﬁrst nation to experience thehorrors of atomic devastation, and the long-termsuffering of the victims who were not killed out-
right served as a constant reminder that war could
now destroy a whole people and deform babies
born years after their parents’ exposure to radia-
tion. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution of1946, largely written by MacArthur and his staff,is unique in its declaration that: ‘the Japanese
people forever renounce war as a sovereign right
of the nation. ... Land, sea and air forces, as 

well as other war potential, will never be main-tained.’ It later proved an embarrassment to the Americans, who wanted Japan to be in a posi-
tion to defend itself against China. So quickly 
do world perspectives change. But was it just
MacArthur and his constitution-making that
turned the Japanese away from military adven-ture? Clearly the Japanese experience had demon-strated the futility of war and went on to nurture
a strong peace movement.Many reforms introduced by the Americansduring the occupation years ﬁtted in with earlierJapanese traditions and were in practice adaptedby the Japanese to suit their needs. Thus the asso-
ciations which they were encouraged to form in
rural and urban communities for social, politicalor cultural purposes were nothing new; the samewas true of agricultural and fishing coopera-tives. In the 1930s many such organisations had
existed; they were not democratic but they were
controlled and tightly supervised by the govern-
ment, for which they were a useful means of com-munication. The occupation also introduced newlegal freedoms to limit direction by the central
government and to provide a basis for democracy.
But they did not, as it turned out, inhibit ‘guid-
ance’ from the national government – which was
generally followed. The Japanese people wereaccustomed to act in a group and to look toauthority for leadership. Nor did the American
encouragement that they form trade unions to
check the powers of industrialists lead to the
results experienced in the US. Japanese tradeunions tended to be rather different. They wereorganised on the basis of each enterprise, that is
all the permanent employees in one company
would form a union to negotiate with manage-
ment, rather than workers of particular tradesorganising themselves nationally. The family andthe company became the dominant groupings of
post-war Japan. Decentralisation of education,
equal political rights for women and social welfare
were among other notable innovations of the
occupation dictated to the Japanese people fromabove. A constitution designed to make theelected parliamentary assembly sovereign, and
reducing the emperor to symbolic status, pro-
vided the political framework of post-1945 Japan.
Until the Cold War in 1947 began to castshadows, free political activity was permitted.From Japan’s prisons communists and socialists
emerged and they set out to radicalise the trade
unions and politics. MacArthur, anything but a
socialist, regarded such freedom as necessary. He
was determined to teach the Japanese themeaning of democracy.The single most remarkable difference betweenthe occupation of Japan and that of Germany was
the continuity of institutions that was maintained
in Japan. While making it clear that he was theultimate authority, MacArthur ruled indirectlythrough a Japanese government and Diet. He
remained an austere and aloof ﬁgure, very much

statesmen, who had ‘advised’ the emperor andwho behind the scenes had once exercised muchreal authority. MacArthur observed oriental cour-
tesies and, except in pursuit of those accused of
war crimes, was benign. An extraordinary rela-
tionship developed between him, the occupyingforces and the Japanese people. MacArthur issuedno orders against fraternisation such as proved so
ineffective in Germany: the Japanese people were
not to be treated as enemies or outcasts. It was
not pleasant for them to be under foreign occu-
pation but in the ﬁrst few months there wereadvantages too. The occupying forces brought infood to save the Japanese people from starvation
and helped to rebuild the infrastructure of the
Japanese economy.The wholesale introduction of Western, espe-cially American, models and their imposition onJapan, as if Japan were a blank sheet in 1945, did
not always work. For example, MacArthur con-
demned the big business corporations like Mitsui
and Mitsubishi – the zaibatsuwhich had domin-ated Japanese industry and which had been closelybound up with the ruling political oligarchies
before 1945 – as bearing, with the military, the
responsibility for the wars Japan had launched. He
set out to break them up. Yet they were to recover
dramatically after the occupation had come to anend in a new, more efﬁcient form of cooperationof ‘business groupings’, the keiretsu. The closerelationship between government and business in
planning industrial development and economic
policies was revived. The keiretsubecame thepace-setters in the astonishing rise of Japaneseindustry in the 1950s and 1960s.The land reforms instituted by MacArthurexpropriated the large landowners and favoured
the small tenant farmers. But holdings were
insubstantial and relatively unproductive; with theindustrial boom of the 1950s labour moved tothe towns, so agricultural productivity had to be
raised. This required mechanisation and invest-
ment; cooperatives were thus developed which
pooled resources, attracted finance and tookadvantage of the economies of scale, althoughmany small farmers had to supplement their
income with other work. Politically and socially,
the land reforms made an important impact indepriving absentee landlords and aristocrats oftheir wealth and with it their potential for specialinﬂuence, while raising the living standards of the
farmers, who formed a declining proportion of
Japan’s population.For the conservative elite in government andbusiness, 1947 proved a turning point. MacArthurand his headquarters staff during that year re-
versed their earlier democratic encouragement of
industrial relations when a general strike was
called by the unions in February 1947. Though in
its aftermath a socialist coalition government waselected (May 1947 to October 1948) it could notcope with Japan’s economic problems, the mass
unemployment and hyperinflation. An entirely
new wind too was blowing from Washington, that
of containing communism. This reordering ofWashington’s priorities in Europe and Asia bene-ﬁted Japan, which was to be allowed to revive so
that communism would lose its attractions. With
the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, these
attitudes were reinforced. In Japan, communistsand left-wing sympathisers were suppressed. Oncethe conservative parties had come together 
into the Liberal Democratic Party in the mid-
1950s, the political growth of the left was halted
for more than three decades, during which the
conservatives and business elites dominated Japan.Japan became America’s principal ally in easternAsia and a global economic giant. At the same
time a uniquely Japanese way of government 
survived defeat and occupation. It was a Japan
nevertheless, that had been transformed by theexperiences of the Paciﬁc War, by defeat and byclose contact with the US.MacArthur found it best to assert the author-ity of his headquarters indirectly through a
Japanese government. A remarkable Japanese
statesman, Shigeru Yoshida, served during mostof the occupation years and after (1946 to 1947and 1948 to 1954) as Japan’s prime minister. A
subtle pro-Western diplomat, Yoshida created
good personal relations with MacArthur but was
determined at the same time to maintain what hesaw as sound conservative Japanese government,free from any new military adventurism. The
Japanese people were in desperate straits at the
end of the war, relying on American food to save1THE UNITED STATES361
them from starvation. Yoshida was less concernedwith a democratic transformation than withrecovery, and he regarded with deepest misgiv-
ings MacArthur’s new labour laws favouring mil-
itant unionism in the early years of severe
shortages, as well as the upsurge of the left. Thebureaucracy he recreated and the businessmenworking closely with government bodies, which
from the earliest days were masterminding Japan’s
recovery, were the same men who had efﬁciently
overseen Japan’s mobilisation for war in the
1930s. Now they were mobilising Japan’sresources for peace and subtly avoiding SCAP’sdirectives, relating for example to the dismantling
of factories or to reparations, which would
impede the recovery. As in Western-occupied
Germany, managers, despite their early associa-tions with the totalitarian regime, were the onlyones available to bring about the economic revival
on which, alone, a secure political structure offer-
ing individual rights and freedoms could be based
– a strange irony.The year 1947 was one of major foreign policyreassessments in the US after the failure to reach a
settlement with the Soviet Union. It was the year
when George Kennan was instructed by Secretary
of State Marshall to set up the Policy PlanningDepartment in the State Department, the year ofthe Truman Doctrine, intended to stop Soviet
subversion in the eastern Mediterranean and
Turkey, and the year of the Marshall Plan,
designed to speed up the economic recovery offree Europe and thereby block the Soviet Unionfrom spreading communism. In eastern Asia, too,
some new defensive line had to be considered.
The growing disillusionment with Nationalist
China led to thoughts, by the end of that year,
that US interests did not necessarily require an allyon the mainland of Asia. American security in thePaciﬁc could be based on the islands of Japan and
the Philippines. Japan would have to be sufﬁ-
ciently built up economically and militarily on
land, on the sea and in the air to be able to defenditself. Since Japan was supposed to have no armedforces at all a National Police Reserve was
recruited which eventually (after 1960) became
the well-equipped and formidable NationalDefence Force with warships, an air force andtanks some 250,000 strong. MacArthur’s call for apeace treaty in 1947 and his suggestion that the
Japanese be left to themselves was shelved when
Russia and China rejected the initiative. Mean-
while the American occupation changed course.Conservative supporters of the pre-1945 Japan,purged in their hundreds of thousands, were qui-
etly allowed to regain their civic rights; the liberal
trade union laws were hedged about and this time
it was the communists and the radical left who
were purged. Having survived a period of politicaluncertainty, the conservative Japanese politiciansgained a virtually permanent hold on power.Japan’s rapid recovery should be attributedprincipally to the hard work and skill of the
Japanese people. Nevertheless, the US duringMacArthur’s ‘viceroyalty’ had made, on balance,an important, positive contribution. In allowing
the Japanese to retain their institutions in modi-
ﬁed form, in ruling through the Japanese gov-
ernment with the full support of EmperorHirohito, in rebuilding Japanese self-esteem, inproviding humanitarian assistance and stimulating
necessary reforms, the occupation was relatively
benign. And this despite the injuries inﬂicted by
the Japanese on the US and its Allies during the
war. The US became not only Japan’s mostimportant export market, but also a model for theconsumer’s paradise which hard work would
allow the Japanese to enter. The bitterness of the
war years was expunged, and while American–
Japanese relations have not always run smoothlysince, a ﬁrm basis for the attachment of Japan tothe West had been laid during these years of over-
whelming American inﬂuence.The confrontation that built up between the USand the Soviet Union reﬂected each side’s strongideological preconceptions. The West believed itfaced a relentless communist drive in Europe, Asia
and the oil-rich Middle East, while the Soviet
Union felt exposed to the hostility of the capital-
ist West. In Europe in 1945, neither the SovietUnion nor the Western powers were certainwhere the ‘frontier’ would ﬁnally run between
them. Only in conquered Germany was the divi-
sion becoming clear.362THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8
In Germany overwhelmingly large numbers ofRed Army divisions and far fewer American andBritish troops faced each other across zonal occu-
pation lines that were rapidly hardening into an
armed border. Neither politically nor economic-
ally was Germany being treated as one unit, ashad been agreed at Potsdam in 1945. Mutualrecriminations grew. West and East were each
piling up grievances against the other.For the Americans, the problems of Europeafter the defeat of Germany were seen more in
economic and political terms than military. Theagreements reached at Potsdam were difﬁcult tocarry out. The Soviet Union was proving an awk-
ward ‘ally’. But in 1945 and 1946, despite grow-
ing tension with the Soviet Union, American
forces were leaving Europe to be demobilised athome. The divisions that remained were intendednot as a defence against Russia, but as the mini-
mum necessary to control the Germans. The main
aim of US policy was to ensure that basic living
standards were maintained and that money wasmade available for relief supplies. Each occupyingpower in Germany – the USSR, Britain, France
and the US – went its own way. For the British,
themselves weak economically, the task of main-
taining food supplies in their zone was a heavy
burden, using up the dollars loaned from the US.General Lucius Clay was the man appointed tooversee the US zone. Accusing the Soviet occupa-

tion authorities of not fulfilling agreements
reached, in May 1946 he cut off German repara-

tions to the East. As tensions grew, the US contin-
ued to feel safe in the knowledge that it was theonly nation to possess the atomic bomb. It was
unrealistic to expect America to share its secrets
with the Russians, any more than the Russians
were willing to share their armaments secrets with
the Americans. But the atomic weapon was some-
thing different. One day the Soviet Union wouldbe able to make its own nuclear weapons – sooner
than anyone expected – and other nations too. The
US could use its advantageous position to reach an
international agreement that would eventuallycontrol production, perhaps eliminate the weaponaltogether, so avoiding a nuclear-arms race. The
Americans did evolve a plan (the Baruch Plan) in
June 1946 which entailed, as it was bound to, con-
trol and inspection in stages over raw materials andatomic plants through the establishment of a UNInternational Atomic Energy Authority. But the
US insisted it would retain its atom bombs until all
the stages of control and supervision had been sat-

isfactorily completed. Thus the Russians wouldhave to reveal all their secret nuclear research whilethe US alone would hold viable atomic weapons.
The Russians countered with a plan to ban the pro-

duction of atomic weapons, to be followed by the
destruction of existing (US) weapons, and at the
UN they vetoed the American proposals. Withouttrust between the Soviet Union and the US, nei-
ther plan would work. The Russians were deter-

mined to catch up with the Americans and the
Americans understandably were not going to
throw away their advantage and fall behind. Wouldan act of faith on America’s part have persuadedthe Soviet Union to be more amenable to Western
demands over Germany or Eastern Europe? It
seems unlikely.For Washington the most urgent need was toassess Stalin’s future intentions. There was a con-sensus that the Soviets were concerned for their
own security and that Stalin was isolating the
Soviet Union while continuing to build up its
industrial might and thus its military potential 
at the expense of its people’s standard of living.But in ensuring its security how aggressive wouldthe Soviet Union prove to be? How many coun-
tries on its borders, not yet within its full grasp,
would it seek to dominate? The degree of destruc-
tion the Soviet Union had suffered during thewar, the paramount need for reconstruction which constrained Soviet leaders from risking war
with the West, Stalin’s own preoccupation with
consolidating his power at home and Soviet 
power in Eastern and central Europe, his innate
caution – all these factors were given insufﬁcientweight. They were certainly underrated by GeorgeKennan, an American diplomat serving in the
Embassy in Moscow who did more than anyone
else to provide on the Western side the intellec-
tual Cold War rationale. In February 1946 he sentan 8,000-word telegram to Washington with hispsychological assessment of the Soviet leadership’s
outlook on world affairs. In it Kennan explained
that he did not accept that the comparative1THE UNITED STATES363
weakness of the Soviet Union would force theSoviet leadership to pursue limited goals. Butwhatever utopias of distant future world conver-
sion Marxist-communism held out to its believ-
ers, it was current realism that would dictate
Soviet policies. Kennan advised that Soviet behav-iour in world affairs was not the result of anyobjective analysis of the situation beyond its
borders but was shaped by a traditional and
instinctive sense of Russian insecurity. Soviet
leaders reacted to this insecurity by taking the
offensive ‘in a patient but deadly struggle for totaldestruction of rival power, never in compacts andcompromises with it’. Therefore, coexistence
between the West and the Soviet Union was not
possible. The Soviets sought complete control to
secure Soviet power, the international inﬂuenceof the US therefore had to be destroyed. TheSoviet Union was impervious to reason, Kennan
warned, and responded only to force. It will with-
draw, and usually does, he added, when strong
resistance is encountered at any point. Soviet aimswere revolutionary, unlimited and global.Was the West not then facing a situationsimilar to the 1930s, when Hitler had aimed at
domination while lulling his neighbours with talk
of peace and limited aims? Munich and the folly
and danger of appeasement provided a vividlesson of history about which no one needed tobe reminded a decade later. The opposite to
appeasement was the new doctrine of ‘contain-
ment’. The Soviet Union would not be allowed
to expand further by direct aggression or indirectsubversion. The provision of military equipmentand economic assistance to the countries border-
ing on the Soviet sphere was intended to create
the ‘strong resistance’ at every point which
Kennan’s ‘long telegram’ (as it came to be called)
had advocated. Soviet intransigence in diplomacyover the German question and at the UnitedNations appeared to conﬁrm Kennan’s analysis, as
did the Soviet refusal to withdraw from northern
Iran. Soon after the arrival in Washington of
Kennan’s cable, which was much admired andwidely distributed, the crisis in Iran broke.Iran during the Second World War had provideda vital supply route for Western aid to the SovietUnion. But the Shah’s inclinations had been pro-German, so in 1941 the Russians in the north andthe British in the south had jointly occupied the
country. The Shah had been forced to abdicate in
favour of his son, with whom Britain and the
Soviet Union had then signed a treaty undertakingto leave Iran six months after the end of the war.The Russians after the war promised to withdraw
in March 1946. Meanwhile in the provinces they
had occupied they were encouraging autonomy,
promoting an independence movement and refus-
ing the Iranian troops entry. As the price for with-drawing its troops, the Soviet Union demandedoil concessions and autonomy for the province. 
At the UN Security Council there were sharp
debates. The American secretary of state, James 
F. Byrnes, who until then had taken a conciliatoryline towards the Soviet Union, now stronglybacked Iran. In May 1946 the Russians withdrew
from Iran without gaining any of their aims.The crisis was important for the lessons thatwere read into it. Firmness in resisting Sovietexpansion had paid off. The Russians had beenwarned off. The US had joined Britain in a region
traditionally within Britain’s predominant sphere.
The US judged its national interests to have been
affected by events in a country on Russia’s bor-
ders, thousands of miles from its own. This was animportant psychological step to have taken. Thenew assumption, expressed in the policy of con-
tainment, was that after the great expansion of the
Soviet sphere of control in central and Eastern
Europe, further expansion must be resisted inregions on its borders to which Soviet control hadnot yet expanded – Turkey, Afghanistan and, lying
in between, Iran. American motives were not
entirely altruistic. Oil had become a vital issue. Oil
reserves in the US were no longer judged sufﬁ-
cient for its future needs and it was seeking, incommercial rivalry with the British, to expand itsoil interests in the Middle East. American oil com-
panies were accordingly receiving strong backing
from Washington.When the Russians in that summer of 1946delivered a strong note that made demands onTurkey, it seemed in the West, so soon after the
Iranian crisis, to be part of a well-planned Soviet
tactic to probe for the West’s weak points. In fact364THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8
Soviet desires for a revision of the Straits had been raised by Stalin during the wartime Alliedconferences. The Turks had secured in 1936
complete sovereign rights over the Straits, and the
Russians indicated their wish to reverse this,
reverting to a degree of international control. Atthe time Roosevelt and Churchill told Stalin thatthey thought Russia’s aims reasonable and just.
But by August 1946 the wartime comradeship in
arms had given way to deep distrust. The Soviet
Union did not persist in its pressure on Turkey,
and the tension eased.By the winter of 1946–7 communist forceswere also threatening the stability of Turkey’s
neighbour Greece, which was in the throes of a
civil war, with Britain assisting the royal Greek
government ﬁnancially and militarily. By this timea consensus was emerging in Washington that theWest was facing a tenacious and persistent
Moscow-led communist offensive designed to
expand Soviet control and to undermine the cohe-
sion of the West through subversion or throughlocal communist parties wherever points of weak-ness could be exploited. What was probably true
up to a point became exaggerated in Washington
into a belief that there was a masterplan in exis-
tence in Moscow and that everything that was
happening was in accordance with such a plan.No doubt schemes were being devised in theKremlin, argued about and constantly changed
when the unfolding of events did not correspond
to the scientiﬁc precepts of Marxism–Leninism.
Nor were communists outside the Soviet Unionentirely free from primitive nationalist deviations,as Yugoslavia was so soon to demonstrate to the
world. In 1947, Moscow’s communist empire was
by no means secure and the devastated Soviet
Union was far behind the West in economic
strength. Stalin would not hesitate to take advan-tage of Western embarrassments where he could,and in the longer term would hope to beneﬁt
from social revolutions in the West. But the Soviet
Union was in no condition to risk war.The Greek communist guerrillas had receivedhelp from their communist neighbours, and it wasbelieved in Washington and London that the
Russians were really behind the conflict. The
Greek communists on the contrary felt let downby Stalin. The most likely explanation is thatStalin kept to his undertaking not to help theGreek communists directly. The help they did
receive from Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria and
Romania branded them, in the eyes of many
Greeks, as traitors to the national cause, especiallyas this assistance was being offered by formerenemies. The American administration was no
partisan of the corrupt and inefﬁcient royalist gov-
ernment but the need to check the Soviet Union,
which stood to gain from a communist victory 
in Greece, overshadowed other considerations.When Foreign Secretary Bevin’s telegram arrivedin February 1947 announcing that Britain could
no longer sustain the ﬁnancial burden of sup-
porting the anti-communist Greek government,
Washington was ready to respond. Kennan’s longtelegram and the discussions in Washingtonduring the course of 1946 and 1947 prepared the
way for a spectacular American reaction to the
‘Soviet communist threat’. The response would
be global, not piecemeal, and so would mirror theperceived global communist threat. Greece wasthe catalyst, not the cause.Secretary of State General George Marshall washelped in his new task by the experienced Dean
Acheson, under secretary in the State Departmentand a strong supporter of Soviet containment. Adifﬁculty to be overcome, however, was Congress,
which would have to vote the funds, and the
Senate was controlled by the Republicans, who
were in no mood for high federal expendituresand had already blocked much of Truman’sdomestic programme. If bipartisan support could
not be secured, Truman knew that his world poli-
cies would be wrecked just as surely as Wilson’s
had been after the First World War. So he carefully
cultivated the Senate and was extraordinarily for-tunate in that the leading Republican on theSenate Foreign Relations Committee was Arthur
Vandenberg from Michigan. Once an isolationist,
he had been converted by Pearl Harbor to a global
view of America’s national and security interests.On 27 February 1947 Truman met congressionalleaders, including Senator Vandenberg, in the
White House and put forward the case for aid to
Greece. Yet something more striking than Greek1THE UNITED STATES365
difﬁculties was needed to persuade Congress, andDean Acheson supplied it. Aid to Greece wasplaced in the context of combating the designs of
a communist assault on the free world. Kennan
and Marshall thought that Truman’s celebrated
message to Congress, which was to go down inhistory as the Truman Doctrine, was rather toosweeping, indeed an overstatement of the case,
especially as Turkey was now included.But on 12 March 1947 Truman went aheadregardless and delivered the message in person to
Congress. The Soviet Union was not mentionedby name, but no one doubted which enemy hehad in mind. ‘I believe it must be the policy of
the US to support free peoples who are resisting
attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by
outside pressure’, he declared. ‘In helping freeand independent nations to maintain theirfreedom, the US will be giving effect to the prin-
ciples of the Charter of the United Nations.’
Truman then asked for ﬁnancial aid for Turkey
and Greece and authority for American militaryand civil personnel to assist their governments.Voices were raised in opposition, but the great
majority of both Houses of Congress approved.
As far as American and world opinion was con-
cerned, the Truman Doctrine was regarded as a
dramatic turning point in US policy. On closeexamination it can be seen to have been steadilyevolving during the ﬁrst two years of the Truman
administration. But it still left many questions
unanswered. Was the US committed to aid every
government, however corrupt, provided it wasfaced with internal or external communist pres-sure? The world after all was not simply divided
between communist tyranny and free nations.
The Truman Doctrine did not provide a guide
that could be uncritically and automatically
applied regardless of all other considerations.The Truman Doctrine set the stage for itsnatural complement, the Marshall Plan, publicly
unveiled in a speech delivered by Secretary of
State George Marshall at Harvard on 5 June
1947. He appealed to American altruism and gen-erosity to help check hunger and destitution inEurope, but he made no references to combating
communism, although that was the Plan’s princi-
pal aim. On the contrary, all of Europe, as wellas the Soviet Union, was included in its scope. In1945 the US had extended economic aid on nomore than a short-term basis in the belief that
Western Europe would speedily recover. The
problem at that time seemed to be one of inter-
national ﬁnancial mechanisms, a temporary dollarshortage, to be solved by pressuring the Europeanrecipients of American loans to accept the new
international financial order worked out at
Bretton Woods. In 1947 the Truman administra-
tion recognised that West European recovery was
desperately slow and without further Americanaid would be slower still. Severe food shortagescontinued and Western Europe could not pay
with its exports what it needed to import from
North America. Without American aid, the West
European peoples would experience not onlygreat hardship but possible internal disruption.Distress was the seedbed on which communism
ﬂourished. Occupied Western Germany, Italy and
France were believed in Washington to be most
directly threatened.In extending massive economic help toWestern Europe, however, the Truman adminis-
tration faced several problems. How to ensure
that the enormous funds required would be 
properly used? The Americans intended to run
the programme, yet a way of doing this withoutinjuring European national susceptibilities had to be found. Which countries were to be offered
aid? The Americans rightly believed that it was
essential for the recovery of Western Europe that
the West German occupation zones should beincluded, yet the recovery of West Germanywould create difﬁculties with France.It was clearly not America’s aim to extend eco-nomic aid to the Soviet Union, yet Marshall did
not wish to be accused of dividing Europe, so he
avoided excluding any European nation by namefrom his proposals.Marshall and his advisers, above all DeanAcheson, solved these problems with subtlety. In
his speech announcing the Plan, Marshall said
that the offer of aid was directed not against anycountry but against hunger, desperation andchaos; assistance, he continued, should not be
piecemeal, nor a mere palliative, but should
provide a cure. The gist of Marshall’s proposal366THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8
was that the European countries should ﬁrst reachagreement among themselves on what they coulddo and what help was needed from the US. The
US would not formulate a programme – that was
the business of the Europeans, from whom the
initiative must come:The programme should be a joint one, agreedto by a number of, if not all, European nations.
The role of this country should consist of
friendly aid in the drafting of a European 
programme and of later support of such a pro-gramme so far as it may be practical for us todo so.A week later, Marshall afﬁrmed that the SovietUnion was included in the offer.The American chosen to run the show was PaulHoffman, president of the Studebaker automobile
corporation. But it was now up to the European
nations to respond. In London, Bevin recognisedat once the signiﬁcance of the ideas set in motionby Marshall’s speech; it meant not only theinvolvement of the US in the economic recovery
of Western Europe, but American readiness to
participate in its defence against communism.
What mattered was to secure an immediatefavourable response from the French. On his owninitiative Bevin paid the French the compliment of
ﬂying to Paris in June to consult Foreign Minister
Bidault and other members of his government.
The French insisted that the Russians should be
invited and be given an opportunity to join.Molotov duly came to Paris on 27 June 1947to join the Paris conference on the Marshall Plan.
Had he remained and dragged out the negotia-
tions, the chances of the US Congress voting large
sums to aid the Russians were nil. But Molotovplayed no sophisticated game; he denounced theMarshall Plan and forced the East European states
to boycott the offer. The Czechs, who had already
accepted an invitation to attend, were forced to1THE UNITED STATES367

together with the three military governors repre-
senting the Western German occupation zones.
They agreed on the outlines of a four-yearEuropean recovery programme. By the followingApril 1948, a permanent Organisation for Euro-
pean Economic Co-operation, the OEEC, had
been set up. This in turn worked out the individ-
ual programmes of the participating countries (theGerman Federal Republic, formed from theWestern occupation zones, became a full member
in October 1949). Congress meanwhile had
established an American counterpart in 1948, the
US Economic Co-operation Administration.Through it, $12,992 million of aid between 1948and 1952, as well as technical assistance, more
than 90 per cent of which was not repayable, was
channelled to the Western European nations. In
the event little Western European economic inte-
gration, one of Marshall’s aims, was achieved; butthe aid was a signiﬁcant accelerator of the recoveryalready under way before 1948.The need the US perceived to reconstructWestern European societies was not entirely altru-
istic of course. Americans saw such reconstructionas the necessary condition of preventing thespread of communism. What did converge, how-ever, were American policy aims and the greaterprosperity and happiness of the peoples of
Western Europe. It has been argued that a desire
for American export markets was one of the
motives behind Marshall’s offer; in fact, exports toEurope constituted only a small fraction of UStrade. More notable is the American insistence on
European economic cooperation. What most con-
cerned the Truman administration was not any
narrow US economic advantage – indeed, some ofthe policies Americans now urged ran counter totheir immediate economic interests – but the
strengthening of Western Europe. American pol-
icy in this respect coincided with the hopes and
aims of the West European governments.Relations with the Soviet Union deterioratedto a new low point in the wake of the Truman
Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and the evident
determination of Britain and the US to move
towards a separate West German state. The agree-
ments reached at Potsdam to treat Germany as awhole were for all practical purposes dead by thespring of 1948. Would it be possible to maintain
the Potsdam arrangements for the four-power
occupation of Berlin? The Kremlin was to test the
West’s resolve. In the summer of 1948, the Sovietblockade of Berlin created the most serious crisisof the immediate post-war era.368THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8

Collection/CorbisFrom the Kremlin’s point of view towards the endof 1947, things were not going well. The West
was disputing Soviet dominance in Eastern and
central Europe with the Truman Doctrine and theMarshall Plan. Was not the Soviet Union entitledfor its own security to an extension of inﬂuence
over its neighbours? Twenty-eight million had
died to achieve it. After the early and genuine
welcome for the liberating Red Army among
quite large numbers of Poles, Bulgarians andCzechs, communist support was eroding andnationalism was reasserting itself.The Soviet response to US intervention inEurope was one of uncertainty. In September
1947 the Cominform was established to try tobring all the communist parties into ideologicalconformity as prescribed by Moscow. The Soviet
Union’s principal ideologue, Andrei Zhdanov,
laid down the doctrine that the world was now
divided into imperialist, anti-democratic forces on
one side, and the democratic, anti-imperialistcamp on the other and that the US was buildingup foreign bases and was expansionist in its aims.
It was a clear message to all comrades that
Moscow’s interpretation should be accepted as
correct. In Poland, Wladyslaw Gomulka stoutlyinsisted on following Poland’s road to socialism;this did not include, for example, collectivisation
of Poland’s farmers. Gomulka was allowed to
remain in power for less than a year. In
Czechoslovakia the parliamentary constitutionalframework, political parties and a coalitionNational Front government had not movedforward yet to complete communist domination.
Preparations for tighter communist control in
Eastern Europe were no doubt initiated after theCominform conference, but it was in Stalin’sinterests to postpone an open crisis as there still
appeared to be some possibility of blocking
Anglo-American plans for the consolidation of
the West German zones of occupation into an
eventual separate Western-orientated state.After the failure in December 1947 of theLondon Foreign Ministers’ Conference to reach
any settlement over Germany, the Russians
proved surprisingly accommodating over Austria
and on a number of other East–West questions.The signal from Moscow was that progress couldstill be made, that the West should be patient.
However, Anglo-American patience had run out
and on 23 February 1948, another London con-
ference was convened to discuss the future of
Germany. This time it was attended only by theambassadors of Germany’s Western neighbours,the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and
France, plus Britain and the US. Agreement was
reached on ending the stalemate over Germany,
with all its harmful consequences for WestGerman and West European recovery. It wasaccepted that the new arrangements planned for
the Western zones of Germany would lead to a
breach with the Soviet Union. Tension was
expected but not the crisis of 1948. That thisoccurred was the fortuitous coming together of1Chapter 321948CRISIS IN EUROPE – PRAGUE AND BERLINthe Western plans for Germany and the commu-nist coup in Czechoslovakia.From Moscow’s point of view the Czech coupcould not have been worse timed. The govern-
ment crisis in Prague lasted from 20 to 27
February 1948, at the very time when the Westernforeign ministers were meeting in London.Communism was showing its most unacceptable
face. Moscow seemed, so it was thought in the
West, bent on ruthless expansion and the suppres-
sion of freedom. The end of Czech democracy was
bloodily marked by Jan Masaryk’s fall to his deathfrom his study window. Whether the popularCzech foreign minister had been pushed, or
whether he had deliberately chosen this dramatic
suicide as a gesture to the world, will never be
known. A few months later, the other monumentof free Czechoslovakia, President Eduard Benesˇ,also died. All he had striven for lay in ruins.Was there really a planned communist coup orhad the opponents of the communists miscalcu-
lated? Were they in fact responsible for what hap-pened? In one sense they were. The Czechgovernment was a broad coalition which included
some communists, not least the prime minister,
Klement Gottwald. But the February crisis was
neither ordered by Moscow nor initiated by
Gottwald. The ministers opposed to the commu-nists had resigned and Gottwald replaced themwith communists. With a general election due in
the summer of 1948, it appeared that the com-
munist opposition had committed political
suicide and that there had been no coup as wasclaimed in the West at the time. But appearancesare misleading.During the winter of 1947–8, both in theCabinet and in parliament tension between the
communists and their opponents had led to
increasingly bitter conflict. The communist minister of the interior, protected by the com-munist prime minister, illegally extended his
powers; the security apparatus and police were
being transformed into instruments of the
Communist Party, endangering basic civic free-doms. The non-communist ministers protestedand insisted on bringing to book the offending
communists in the government. But the commu-
nist ministers countered by threatening to useforce and, in order to avoid defeat in parliament,mobilised groups of their supporters in thecountry. The communist-dominated workers’
factory councils met in Prague on 22 February
1948. It was intended that their well-orchestrated
demands should provide the pretext for forcingout the non-communist government supporters.But twelve non-communist ministers chose to
anticipate Gottwald’s manoeuvre. When, on 20
February, the communist interior minister refused
to reinstate eight non-communist senior police
ofﬁcers despite a majority vote of the Cabinet infavour of doing so, they resigned. The normalconstitutional procedure would have been for
them to continue in a caretaker government.
President Benesˇwas expected to, and at ﬁrst did,
insist that no new government could be formedwhich did not include ministers representing theparties that were not communist. If Benesˇhad
held to this line, Gottwald’s communist ministers
would not then have been able to form a gov-
ernment; the only non-violent way out of thedeadlock for them would have been either to giveway to the non-communists or to risk defeat in a
general election which would have had to have
been brought forward. That would not have
given the communists enough time to rig the
elections. The opponents of the communists cal-culated that early elections were the best guaran-tee of preserving democracy in Czechoslovakia;
the longer they waited, the less possible it would
be for the non-communist parties to campaign
freely, since the interior minister was subvertingthe impartiality of the police and placing com-munists in key positions. Thus it was in the inter-
ests of the supporters of democracy to bring the
crisis to a head quickly. Admittedly it was a des-
perate throw and the democrats lost.Gottwald proved to be tough and utterly ruth-less. He resorted to a show of violence in Prague.Armed militia and the police took over Prague;
communist demonstrations were mounted; an
anti-communist student demonstration was bro-
ken up. ‘Action committees’ were organisedthroughout the country to carry through a purgeof opponents of communism. The ministries of
the non-communist ministers were occupied, civil
servants dismissed and the ministers prevented370THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8
from entering their own ministries. The army wasconﬁned to barracks and did not interfere. Theshow of force proved sufﬁcient. Some dissidents
in the democratic parties agreed, unfortunately,
to work with the communists, giving Gottwald’s
list of new ministers a spurious National Frontappearance. Benesˇwas old and weak; he held out
no longer. He believed that the country might be
plunged into civil war and he thought that even
Soviet intervention was possible if he did not give
in to Gottwald’s demands. He therefore agreed
to a new communist-dominated Cabinet withoutholding immediate elections. On 27 February1948, the new government was sworn in.
Democracy was ﬁnished.A party that in the last free elections hadsecured just over a third of the electorate’s votes,and probably did not command even that supportin 1948, could not have gained control of the
government and of the country without threat-
ening violence and undermining the democratic
institutions and the loyalty of the police before-hand. It is true that the non-communists hadchosen the time for the inevitable showdown, but
it was bound to happen anyway. They may have
been ill advised in their tactics, but it made no
real difference. The communists were determined
to gain control and they knew they could not doso in free elections only a few months away. Aminority usurped the wishes of the majority.
Gottwald had covered his coup with no more
than a thin façade of constitutionality which did
not fool the Czechoslovak people or the West atthe time, though it fooled a few historians later.The impact on Western governments and public
opinion was enormous, strengthening their
resolve. The majority of the US Congress was
persuaded that America’s own security required
close cooperation with Western Europe againstSoviet-led communism. The Prague coup ﬁnallydiscredited Soviet moves to prevent the formation
of a West German state and accelerated the con-
clusion of a West European alliance, the Brussels
Treaty, in March 1948. It was self-evident in theWest that it had been fear of Soviet interventionthat had enabled the Czech communists to black-
mail the whole nation. The Soviet threat would
have to be met by measures of mutual security.The formation of the Western alliance and theplans for ending the occupation of Germany wereintimately linked. The French continued to fear a
resurgence of Germany and fought a rearguardaction to retain Allied control over the Ruhr.Bevin tried to calm their fears, stressing that
France could rely on the Anglo-French Treaty of
Dunkirk, concluded in March 1947, whichpromised immediate British military assistance ifGermany attacked. By January 1948, Bevin had
become more alarmed about Soviet intentionsthan about what the Germans might do at somefuture date. He called for a West European
Union. What he was aiming for, however, was not
a united Europe; the West European states wereto preserve their sovereignty but should concludetreaties between them for their mutual defence.
On 17 March 1948, Bevin, Bidault and theirBelgian counterpart, Paul Henri Spaak, con-cluded the Brussels Treaty. This bound Britain,
France and the Benelux countries (Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg) to take whateversteps were necessary ‘in the event of a renewal byGermany of a policy of aggression’; the signator-
ies also promised to come to each others’ defenceif attacked by any aggressor in Europe. Thisarticle (IV) applied to the Soviet Union without
speciﬁcally naming it. There was provision for
other states to join. Although the Brussels Treatywas an essential preliminary to strengthening thelink between Western Europe and the US, and
was intended by Bevin as such, another year was to pass before the North Atlantic alliance(NATO) was concluded. The Brussels Treaty was
in no way supranational. Neither Britain nor
France intended to relinquish its sovereignty toany European council or parliament.With the conclusion of the Brussels Treatymore rapid progress was made on the question ofthe future of West Germany. The Soviet responseto all this was to protest and to withdraw from
the Allied Control Council on 20 March 1948.
As it turned out, that ended all formal four-powercontrol of Germany. The Russians also put pres-sure on the Western Allies in the hope of deter-
ring them from creating a separate West Germanstate; they increasingly interfered with Allied landcommunications to Berlin, which ran, of course,
through the Soviet zone.11948: CRISIS INEUROPE – PRAGUE AND BERLIN371
Berlin, divided into four occupation zones,had, at the end of the Second World War, beenplaced under separate four-power control. Access
to Berlin was an obvious problem for the Western
powers; this was not overlooked in 1945, as has
often been asserted. The French, British andAmerican commanders in Berlin had reached anagreement (29 June 1945) with the Soviet
command guaranteeing to them the use of one
main rail line, one main highway and two air cor-
ridors. Later, a second rail line and a third air 
corridor were added. In January 1948, Sovietinspectors began to board American and Britishmilitary trains demanding to check the papers of
the German passengers. That was just the begin-
ning; worse followed. Alleging technical difﬁcul-
ties and the need for repairs, two rail links wereclosed on 1 April and canal and road trafﬁc wasalso interrupted. But the escalation of pressure
did not deflect the Western states from their
course of action in Germany. A joint conference
held in London ended on 1 June with an agree-ment to set up a West German state. There was,therefore, no longer any reason to delay a separ-
ate currency reform in the West, thus ignoring the
Russian objections. Without sound currency there
could be no economic revival. By the end of June
the currency reforms for Western Germany werecarried out and, after further unsuccessful nego-tiations with the Russians, introduced in the
Western sectors of Berlin too. The Russians now,
on 24 June, cut off all remaining land communi-
cations from the West by rail or road and threeweeks later all barge trafﬁc as well. The blockadeof Berlin by land and canal was now complete.The Soviet authorities justiﬁed the blockade byclaiming that the three Western Allies had broken
the four-power agreements on Germany; they
cited the Western currency reforms in particularas being in breach of the agreement to treatGermany as an economic whole. The Western
Allies protested and insisted on their rights of
access. The one route left to the beleaguered city
was by air – and the Russians had left the air cor-ridors open, no doubt reluctant to launch an all-out challenge. One can surmise their calculations.
The air corridors sufﬁced to supply the Allied gar-
risons and their dependants in the Western sectorsof Berlin. It must have seemed inconceivable that2.25 million blockaded West Berliners couldreceive supplies by air as well.The blockade was intended as a ‘tails you lose,heads we win’ gambit: the Allies would have to
give up either Berlin or their German policy. Afterwithdrawing they would be likely to pay moreattention to Soviet interests. All this would be
accomplished without real risk of war. The Allied
position in Berlin was militarily hopeless. Was
Western public opinion likely to start a third
world war over a German city and over the fateof a people they had so recently done their bestto destroy? Western military experts did, in fact,
advise their governments that it was better to
negotiate and to withdraw with honour than to
be forced out a few weeks later. Even if the Westwere ready for war over Berlin, from a militarypoint of view to ﬁght a way through to the belea-
guered city was not sensible strategy. General
Lucius Clay’s proposal of sending an armed
convoy to Berlin was unrealistic.The military ‘realities’ were, nevertheless,ignored. President Truman and Bevin rejected
‘appeasement’. Despite Berlin, Allied plans for
transforming Bizonia (created by the fusion of the
British and American zones of occupation) into a
West German state went ahead. A GermanParliamentary Council convened in Bonn on 1September 1948. Delegates from the eleven
separate Länderparliaments and from West Berlincame to this historic assembly. The wily Konrad
Adenauer was elected president of the Council. InMay 1949 a Basic Law, a substitute constitutionfor the Federal Republic of Germany, was agreed,
many differences and difficulties having been
overcome. To all appearances it was a constitu-
tion for an independent sovereign state. But
Britain, the US and France still reserved to them-selves ultimate authority. West Germany was notallowed to rearm, and the economy of the indus-
trial Ruhr, though not separated from West
Germany, was placed under inter-Allied control.
Germans were not yet trusted; the new demo-cratic institutions remained in probationary tute-lage to the three Western military governors,
renamed high commissioners. The new West
German state and constitution laid claim to rep-372THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8
resent the wishes of the whole German people,whether living in the East or the West. TheRussians could do little but respond in kind by
turning their zone into a communist captive
German Democratic Republic. It was ostracised
by the West.The changes in West Germany, with her tem-porary capital, Bonn, marked a giant step forward
in the recovery of sovereignty. The Basic Law,
West Germany’s constitution, came into force on
24 May 1949. In August a general election was
held and Adenauer and the CDU unexpectedlyemerged the winners. In September, TheodorHeuss was chosen by parliament to become 
the ﬁrst president and Adenauer was elected chan-
cellor; so began his long years in ofﬁce, which
came to be known as the Adenauer era. On 21September Western military occupation ceased.The Berlin blockade was the ﬁrst great drama ofthe post-war years. It ended with a stunning
diplomatic victory, a triumph for power and goodsense. The air corridors between the West and thebeleaguered city were crowded with a continuous
stream of US and British transport planes carry-
ing everything to the city to keep it alive, includ-
ing coal. It was the Germans in Frankfurt,Hanover, Hamburg and Berlin-Tempelhof,loading and unloading the planes landing everyfew minutes, who were the unsung heroes of the
day. Freddie Laker joined the fun and was later
able, on the proﬁts earned, to found an airline.
The Soviets were careful too to avoid an ultimateshowdown. Soviet air-control towers providedessential guidance along the twenty-mile-wide
corridors and some services located in the Eastern
sectors of Berlin were kept functioning for the
Western sectors. Before it was all over, 2.3 million
tons of food and supplies had been ﬂown to thecity at a cost of $224 million. At the same timethe hated Germans began to be transformed in
Western eyes into steadfast, courageous, freedom-
loving Berliners. In fact, whether in the East or
West, the German people had little choice; butcredit should not be denied to a number ofsincere democratic leaders such as the charismatic
socialist mayor of Berlin, Ernst Reuter, whose
moral authority symbolised the resistance of the
democratic Western ideals against the brutal chal-lenges of totalitarianism.The Berlin crisis painfully demonstrated toStalin the West’s determination to contain the
Soviet Union and to resist pressure. The Soviets
had miscalculated. It was also the ﬁrst crisis that11948: CRISIS INEUROPE – PRAGUE AND BERLIN373
They said it could not be done. The allied airlift enables a whole city – Berlin – to survive. © Bettmann/Corbiscould have turned the Cold War into a hot con-ﬂict. That it did not do so was due not to luck butto careful calculation and restraint on both sides.
Berlin was the ﬁrst example of an East–West con-
frontation taken to the new limits of post-war
diplomacy, dangerously close to an armed clashbut stopping just short of it. The defence ofQuemoi and Matsu off the coast of China and the
Cuban missile crisis were others. The Soviets may
have miscalculated in 1948, the West may have
misinterpreted, but in Moscow, London and
Washington care was taken from the ﬁrst that a sit-uation should not be created that was bound tolead to war. The American administration and the
British Cabinet regarded the airlift as a way out,
avoiding humiliation with minimum risk. It
allowed the West to maintain its position in Berlinwithout use of force. The Russians also refrainedfrom using force and let the airlift function with-
out interruption. In January 1949, Stalin talked to
an American journalist, and so gave the ﬁrst hint
that he was ready to negotiate and to lift theblockade. He tried hard to salvage something andto gain concessions from the US and Britain on
the German question, but without success. After
secret negotiations in May 1949, the Russians
lifted their blockade and the Western nations
raised their counter-blockade of the Soviet Unionand the Eastern German zone, which had stoppedvaluable goods from going east.The Cold War crisis of 1947 and 1948 has-tened a fundamental reappraisal of American poli-
cies. The US commitment to assist in the defenceof Western Europe dramatically increased, but itstill fell short of stationing large armed forces in
Europe. American demobilisation after the war
meant that there were still none to send anyway.
Not until the outbreak of the Korean War in the
summer of 1950 did the US actually start torearm on the scale necessary to back militarily itspromise of global assistance. A year earlier, on 4
April 1949, the US had taken a decisive step
forward in forging an Atlantic–West European
military partnership. The North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation (NATO), although strictly speakingnot an alliance like the Brussels Treaty, with pro-
vision for automatic military assistance, in prac-
tice, despite its careful wording, bound the US tojoin with the West European allies in defenceagainst the threat of Soviet aggression.The conclusion of NATO and its ratiﬁcationby the US Senate marked a revolution in Ameri-
can attitudes to world problems. The defence of
the US was no longer seen in American hemi-spheric terms; the American defence frontier was now clearly delineated in Europe. It ran along
the Elbe and through the Balkans. American
security became global in scope; already deeply
involved in eastern Asia, it would eventually
spread to every part of the world. The US PolicyPlanning Staff, renamed the National SecurityCouncil, created in 1947, was given the brief 
of formulating ‘the long-term programs for 
the achievement of US foreign policy objec-
tives’. It sought to advise on priorities and themeans to achieve them. George Kennan becameits ﬁrst chief. The National Security Council laid
down the doctrine that the biggest threat was 
a Soviet advance and that priority should be 
given to the defence of Western Europe. Succes-sive presidents accepted this advice. For WesternEurope, the nightmare of abandonment by the
US was lifted. Bevin and Bidault, with Dean
Acheson, Truman’s secretary of state after the
retirement of the ailing Marshall in January 
1949, were the principal architects of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Brussels Treaty hadbeen the ﬁrst essential step; now the new link 
was formed between the Brussels Treaty powers
– Britain, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the
Netherlands – and the US and Canada. OnFrench insistence, Italy also became a foundingmember of NATO, and Iceland, Norway,
Denmark and Portugal soon joined. ‘North
Atlantic’ was thus something of a misnomer. The
territory covered by NATO included French
Algeria and, more importantly, provided for thealliance to be activated if ‘the occupation forcesof any party in Europe’ were attacked. In this way
West Germany and the Western sectors of Berlin,
the Western zones of Austria and Vienna were
also included.The heart of the alliance commitment was contained in Article 5, which stated that an attack
on one member country would be regarded as 
an attack on all. Each member of the alliance374THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8
would then assist the country under attack ‘bytaking forthwith, individually and in concert with other parties, such action as it deems neces-
sary, including the use of armed force...’. 

The measures would then be reported to the 
UN Security Council and would cease when the Security Council had taken the necessary stepto restore peace and security. The European part-
ners would have preferred an automatic military
commitment, but this was more than Dean
Acheson could deliver. The great majority of US
senators, both Republicans and Democrats, hadabandoned American isolation but not the con-stitutional powers of the Senate. That had been
shown by the passage the previous year in June
1948 of Senator Arthur Vandenberg’s Senate res-
olution by an overwhelming majority; this hadadvised that the US should develop ‘self-defense’,‘regional and other collective arrangements’
within the UN Charter, with other nations in case
of an ‘armed attack’ threatening the security of
the US. The tortuous wording deliberatelyavoided the word ‘alliance’. A signiﬁcant additionwas that such associations should be governed by
‘constitutional process’, which in plain words
meant that the Senate would not abandon its
rights to decide by majority vote on issues of war
and peace. The resolution had paved the way forthe North Atlantic Treaty, which was duly ratiﬁedby the Senate on 21 July 1949.Not only the US but Canada also came to the aidof Western Europe. During Britain’s dollar crisisfollowing the Second World War, Canada hadprovided $1,250 million, a quarter of the total
loan to Britain, with the US supplying $3,750
million in 1945. Under the premiership of the
longest-serving prime minister in the Western
world (1921–5, 1926–30 and 1935–48), theLiberal William L. Mackenzie King, Canada hadmade a remarkable economic recovery from the
depression years of the 1930s and by the end of
the war had become a major world commercial
power. Its population sharply increased and immi-gration from Europe helped to ﬁll gaps createdby the sustained boom of the early 1950s and
1960s. American capital poured in and US–
Canadian economic cooperation was most strik-ingly symbolised by the joint enterprise of thetransportation–electric-power development of the
deep-water route of the St Lawrence to the GreatLakes.With a combination of political skill and ruth-lessness, Mackenzie King mastered the formidable
problems that faced any government in Canada:
the multi-party system, which often resulted ingovernment based on a minority of popular votes;the problems inherent in managing Dominion
and provincial relationships; and the difﬁculty of
handling the anglophone and francophone rela-
tionship with Liberal Party strength solidly based
in Quebec. Mackenzie King’s cautious policiesfostered a Canadian sense of nationhood, empha-sised the essential unity of the federal Dominion
and strengthened the supremacy of parliament
and central federal government as far as provincial
resistance would allow. The Liberals promotedprogressive legislation in social security and hous-ing, though Mackenzie King’s own inclinations
were conservative.That politics was the art of the possible wasMackenzie King’s abiding principle. In external
affairs he reﬂected the isolationist attitude of themajority of the Canadians in the 1930s. AlthoughCanada joined Britain in the war against Germany
on 10 September 1939, his government promised
that no conscription would be introduced. Never-
theless, Canadian volunteer forces distinguishedthemselves during the war and suffered heavycasualties on the Dieppe raid in 1942. They also
participated in the Italian campaign and the
Normandy landings. The conscription issue
deeply divided French- and English-speaking
Canada and cut across King’s natural politicalbase in Quebec. A plebiscite held in 1942 on the11948: CRISIS INEUROPE – PRAGUE AND BERLIN375

question whether conscription might be allowedwhen the government thought it essential hadresulted in a 72 per cent ‘no’ vote in Quebec and
an 80 per cent ‘yes’ vote in English-speaking
Canada. Not until November 1944 were con-
scripts sent to ﬁght overseas. In the elections of1945 King nevertheless survived, beating bothmain opposition parties, the Co-operative Com-
monwealth Federation to the left and the
Progressive Conservatives to the right. In 1948,
suffering from ill health, he handed over the pre-
miership to a French-Canadian Liberal LouisStephen St Laurent, as ﬁrm a believer in main-taining Dominion power as Mackenzie King. The
economic boom that continued and the success
of the federal government held Quebec French
provincial nationalism in check until after StLaurent’s retirement in 1957 following thevictory of the Progressive Conservative Party in
the June elections, after which John Diefenbaker
became prime minister.Like the US, Canada turned its back on pre-war isolationism. Canadian perceptions ofnational defences had totally changed in the half
century since 1900. At the turn of the century the
main threat was believed to be the possibility of
an invasion from the US, whose ‘manifest destiny’
might include plans to absorb its northern neigh-bour. There were even war plans drawn up by theBritish War Ofﬁce which included British land-
ings in New York and Boston in defence of the
Dominion! In reality the US–Canadian frontier
became the ﬁrst undefended frontier between twogreat nations in the modern world, an examplefollowed in Western Europe only since 1945.
Canada and the US have been indissolubly linked
in the defence of the North American continentsince the agreement reached at Ogdensburg in1940. The relationship with the US indicatesboth close cooperation on the one hand and the
assertion of Canadian independence on the other.
In Lester B. Pearson, external affairs secretary
from 1948 to 1957, Canada contributed a diplo-mat of world stature to international affairs.Lester Pearson played a prominent role in the UN
and contributed to its peacekeeping activities.
The award of the Nobel Peace Prize was ﬁtting
recognition for his skill in ﬁnding a diplomatic
solution to the Suez Crisis in 1956. He also tookhis country into the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation, Canada being one of the founding
members. Thus the New World came to the
rescue of the Old, completely reversing the impe-
rial relationship.NATO formed the cornerstone of the West’sdefence in Europe. Greece and Turkey became
members in 1952; but the role of West Germany
remained a sensitive subject, since it could not yetbe envisaged as a full ally of the West. Was itintended to rearm West Germany and make it a
partner in NATO? No, said the French foreign
minister, Robert Schumann, to the French
Assembly in July 1949:[Germany] has no arms and will have none. ... It is inconceivable to France and her allies

that Germany should be permitted to join the
Atlantic Alliance as a nation capable of defend-
ing herself or of contributing to the defence ofother nations.But history was moving fast. The inconceivablebecame fact just ﬁve years later in 1954.376THE UNITED STATES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE COLD WAR, 1945–8

THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA,
1945–55In 1945 to all appearances the Western nationsonce more dominated the world, including all of
Asia. They had between them at their wartime
conference mapped out the global distribution ofpower. They could display awesome militarypower on land, on sea and in the air and their
technological superiority had been revealed at its
most ruthless in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The
once invincible Japanese had been humbled and
crushed and had become subject to Americanrule. So in 1945 why should the Europeans notregain their old colonies in Asia? Britain chose not
to maintain its imperial role in the Indian sub-
continent while resuming its control of Malaya
and Hong Kong. The Dutch, with British help,intended to regain the Dutch East Indies, and theFrench to regain Indo-China. But the peoples of
Asia were not simply waiting to welcome back
their old masters. Everywhere there were political
movements demanding independence and ready
to ﬁght for it, generally under leadership inspiredby Marxist ideologies. The Europeans would haveto use force to regain colonial mastery.In 1945, the Cold War had not yet becomethe decisive inﬂuence on the shaping of Western
policies. The Soviet Union was not then the mostformidable opponent of British, French andDutch colonial policies: at most, it gave ideolog-
ical support to nationalist movements. It was the
US that opposed European colonialism.The Second World War shattered the image ofWestern superiority in Asia. Within one decadefrom 1945 to 1955, nearly all the Westerncolonies and territorial empires were transformed.
The Philippines gained independence in 1946,
India in 1947, Ceylon and Burma the followingyear; in 1949 the Netherlands relinquished its300-year rule over the Dutch East Indies; the
French were defeated in Indo-China in 1954; and
the British granted independence to Malaya in
1957. The most far-reaching transformation
occurred on the mainland of eastern Asia, inChina. The era of Chinese disintegration came toan end with the communist victory of 1949.
During the four decades that followed, China
successfully asserted its independence from
Western controls. This pattern of enormouschange emerged during the ﬁrst four critical yearsfollowing the Second World War. The ﬁrst short
phase lasted for just a few weeks, from the col-
lapse of Japanese power until the British and
American military commands were able to send
troops; the Americans to the Philippines andKorea, the British to Malaya, to ‘French’ Indo-China and to the Dutch East Indies. During the
brief interval before the troops arrived, the south-
east Asian countries were still subject to the
uncertain Japanese military. A variety of indigen-ous nationalist and socialist factions competed forpower. Their goal was independence, but they
had to decide what tactics to adopt towards the
expected Western military reoccupation. The
reoccupation, which opens a new phase, wasnowhere seriously resisted at ﬁrst. The hope that1Chapter 33THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCETHE PHILIPPINES, MALAYA, INDONESIA AND
INDO-CHINAindependence would be attained by agreementwith the West was not fulﬁlled except on theIndian continent and later in Malaya.The US had never felt at ease as a colonial power,and Americans had a bad conscience about theforcible suppression of Filipino nationalism at theturn of the century. Strategic considerations had
ﬁrst taken the US navy to the Spanish Philippine
Islands in 1898, which, with a naval base in Manila
Bay, became America’s most advanced outpost in
the Paciﬁc. For more than a century, the USretained a strong presence in the Philippines.For the US the economic beneﬁts of colonialpossession were never sufﬁcient, except to special-
interest groups, to dominate relationships. The
Philippines, moreover, were too distant and the‘brown’ Filipino population too numerous – 6million in 1900, 48 million in 1980 – to consider
their absorption in a racially conscious American
society. Self-government, and eventually some
form of independence, was therefore seen early onas the only solution. As, colonial rulers, theAmericans were unique in virtually handing over
the administration of the country to its indigen-
ous population. By 1903, Filipinos held half the
US colonial appointments; by the close of the
1920s, virtually the whole of the colonial gov-ernment in the Philippines was in the hands ofFilipinos.Forty years of American control and tutelageleft an indelible mark on the Philippines. A
Filipino political and economic elite had devel-oped, whose fortunes as landowners, merchants,investors and industrialists were closely tied to 
the US. Trade boomed with the opening of the
US market to Philippine exports and with US
investment in the islands themselves. From the
American point of view during the depressionyears, economic preferential guarantees to thePhilippines were proving disadvantageous. There
were demands to restrict Philippine imports to
the US. The Philippines, not altogether willingly,
were being pushed towards independence in the 1930s. The upper crust of Filipinos, whogained so much from the American connection,
remained ambiguous about complete independ-
ence and sought a special American–Filipino rela-tionship. Attempts to reconcile Filipino desire forindependence and the economic interests of thePhilippines and the US eventually led to the
promise in 1934 of independence after a twelve-
year transitional period. But in 1942 the Japanese
invasion brought the possibility of a transfer to ahalt. The barbarous occupation strengthenedAmerican–Filipino bonds despite a Japanese
proclamation of Philippine ‘independence’ and
the existence of some Filipino collaborators.
When General MacArthur returned, he was hailed
with genuine enthusiasm by the great majority ofFilipinos who hated the Japanese. The destructioncaused by the war was enormous. One million
lives were lost, the economy shattered, most of
industry destroyed as well as agricultural produc-
tion reduced to ruin and Manila devastated.American reoccupation did not, however,usher in a tranquil period. The Americans upheld
the existing social order of the landowners and
the wealthy. The conservative post-1945 regime
established in the Philippines clashed with theguerrillas, the Hukbalahap, or Huk for short. TheHuk guerrillas had ﬁrst fought the Japanese as
well as their rivals. They retained their arms in
1945 and, to begin with, cooperated with
MacArthur. They wished to change Philippine
society radically, basing their power on the land-less, debt-ridden peasants and urban poor. Theywere also nationalists who wanted to end the
semi-colonial relationship with the US. Their
support in the country as a whole was not strong
in 1945 and they declared they were ready to par-ticipate in elections and in the constitutionalprocess. With their aims of social revolution,
however, and their potential to engage in an
armed struggle, they were regarded by the con-
servatives who held power in the government as
a deadly danger to stability and order. The Huk’sarmed militia thus continued to pose a threat tothe prosperous Filipino leadership. As early as
1945, members of the Huk militia were executed
by the Filipino government.The Communist Party of the Philippines tookpart in the 1946 elections, but the six electeddeputies were disbarred from the Filipino Con-
gress. In 1946 drastic action was ordered against
the Huk rising of peasants, with a military sweep380THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
to root out the Huk militia in central LuzonIsland. The Huk responded with an all-out armed rebellion in 1948, their supporters nearly
200,000 strong. In 1949 they were joined by the
Philippine Communist Party and set up a provi-
sional revolutionary government. The strugglewent on for years; by 1954 they were worn downand superior government forces crushed them.
The government had also won some of the peas-
ants away from supporting the rebels by offers of
land and resettlement in protected villages.In the US, by then, the Huk were identiﬁedas forming part of the worldwide communist con-spiracy of subversion in Asia, rather than as an
extreme socialist–communist Filipino movement
resorting to terrorist tactics and deriving their
support from the economic condition of landlesspeasants. Communist international support wasnegligible. The chief victims of Huk recruitment
and terrorism and of government reprisals were
the peasants caught in the nutcracker of Huk
guerrillas, the landlords and the government. In 1946 the US granted formal independence tothe Philippines, but it came with strings attached.
The US required that 100 locations should be
reserved for US military bases and leased for
ninety-nine years, though in 1959 this was
reduced to twenty-ﬁve. The US constructed twogreat naval bases, an airbase and a rest camp,which formed a key to US security planning in
the Paciﬁc until the 1990s. The US–Philippine
defence agreement, their alliances and the pres-
ence of the bases with thousands of US person-nel were regarded by Filipino nationalists asgiving them a semi-colonial status. The US did
not hold itself aloof from internal politics either.
Special economic rights for American business-
men were also secured, and all these conditions
were linked to large-scale US aid and privilegedaccess to the US market.The Philippine government has introducedlimited land reforms since 1954 but has rejected
socialism. The landlord–tenant relationship was
upheld, but the harshness of landlord exploitationwas somewhat limited. With American supportthe Filipino ruling groups retained power. They,
in turn, were not anxious to cut the connection
with the Americans. The US has suffered frombeing identified with the wealthy and corruptruling circles amid widespread poverty. Despite alarge amount of US financial aid intended to
restore the war-shattered Philippines and to help
the peasants and the urban poor, little recon-

struction was undertaken and the majority of thepoor did not beneﬁt: the wealthy Filipinos linedtheir own pockets. The continuation of distress
among the peasantry provided the seedbed that
nourished the Huk movement.The diversity of American objectives in whathad virtually been a colony could not be recon-ciled satisfactorily: to grant independence, to pre-vent a communist–socialist alliance from attaining
power by the ballot box or arms, to ensure gen-
uine basic economic reforms, to provide for the
global security interests of the US in Asia, and tofind friendly and reliable partners among theFilipino political leadership. The US, as a result,
strengthened the few who exploited the weak and
was blamed for their corruption. But US policy
was overshadowed, especially after 1950, by oneaim: to stem the advance of communism in Asia.This was seen primarily not as an internal Asian
problem. The overriding objective was to create a
defensive Asian block against the external enemy,
the Soviet Union, and its ally, communist China.
In pursuit of this aim, the US felt its options werelimited to supporting political leaders it would nototherwise have backed. It also led the US, despite
its earlier disapproval, into a policy of backing the
French, who sought to restore their colonial
empire in Indo-China.Of all the attempts by European nations toreclaim their former empires in south-east Asia, it
looked as if Britain’s return to the Malayan penin-
sula and Singapore would be the least trouble-
some. During the war the most active resistanceto the Japanese had been mounted by theChinese in Malaya, the majority of whom identi-
ﬁed themselves with the communist leadership of
the Malay Communist Party; the party was, in
fact, almost totally composed of Chinese immi-grants to Malaya. The Allies had supported themduring the war and, afterwards, had recognised
their contribution. They alone among the three
races in Malaya had actively fought against the1THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE381
Japanese, and for a good reason: the Japanese,during the early years of occupation from 1942to 1943, oppressed the Chinese more savagely
than the other two nationalities living in Malaya,
the Indian immigrants and the indigenous
Malays. Indeed, many Malays and Indians hadcollaborated with the Japanese and hoped to gain independence with Japanese consent. The
Japanese later became more accommodating
towards the anti-communist Chinese of the busi-
ness community, whose help they needed. They
might even have granted independence, at leastnominally, had it not been for the sudden end ofthe war in August 1945.The British returned to Malaya unopposed.The Chinese communists had decided to collab-
orate with them and to follow the constitutionalpath to independence. Chinese guerrilla groupscame out of the forest where they had carried on
the armed struggle and disbanded, hiding their
weapons in the jungle as a precaution. The colo-
nial administration hoped to re-establish peaceand good order and to prepare for the electoralparticipation of all three races in Malaya on a basis
of equality. These early plans envisaged that the
peninsula of Malaya would be uniﬁed, the tradi-
tional Malay rulers deprived of most of their
powers and a more democratic political regimeintroduced. Singapore, largely Chinese and aBritish colony, would be developed separately.But the British solution satisﬁed no one. Theleaders of the 3.5 million Malays, most of whom
were peasants belonging to the poorest section ofsociety, feared that by conceding equal rights tomore than 2 million Chinese and 700,000 Indian
immigrants they would lose control of their own
country. They therefore opposed the reduction of
the powers of the Malay rulers, who at least
ensured that Malaya was ruled by Malays. TheChinese also objected. They were against the separation of Singapore from the rest of Malaya,
as this would reduce their influence outside
Singapore. In the end the British government had
to withdraw these proposals. In the meantime,both the Chinese communists and the Malayssoon realised that, while the British intended 
to rule benignly, their timetable for Malayan 
independence was long term indeed. They hadresumed imperial rule in Malaya, not for reasonsof false national pride, but because Malayanrubber and Malayan tin were vital export earners
for the shaky post-war British economy. When
the standard of living of the British people was at
stake, the Labour government that came to powerin 1945 was as imperialist as the Conservatives.In 1946, among the majority of the Malays, anon-militant party was formed, the United Malay
National Organisation, to safeguard the rights 
of the Malayans and of the Malay rulers. The
Chinese communists also became active inpolitics. They demanded that the British shouldleave Malaya and tried to make it unproﬁtable for
them to stay, by infiltrating trade unions and
calling strikes. When this had no effect they esca-
lated their pressure by mounting terrorist attackson the British rubber plantations and by murder-ing planters. Unable to make headway by consti-
tutional means, the Chinese communists in 1948
resorted to an all-out armed struggle from jungle
bases. But in Malaya they constituted less thanhalf the population, and in the war – orEmergency, as the British called it – that followed
they never enjoyed any support or sympathy from
the Malays. With the help of some 100,000 Malay
police, 10,000 British and Commonwealth
troops, including Gurkhas, the British pursuedthe Chinese into the jungle. Although theChinese guerrillas never amounted to more than
6,000, to defeat them was an exceedingly difﬁcult
military operation. It involved the resettlement of
some half a million Chinese peasants who hadbeen eking out a living in the jungle and uponwhom the Chinese guerrillas relied for food sup-
plies. The Chinese kept up resistance for more
than a decade, but by 1952 the real threat they
posed had been removed.In one signiﬁcant respect, the communist insur-
rection simpliﬁed matters: those Chinese who didnot support the communists now found common
ground with the Malays. The future of Singapore
remained a thorny problem, but the future of
Malaya would now be settled in negotiation withthe British; the Malays and anti-communistChinese wanted neither an economic nor a social
revolution, nor indeed an armed struggle for
independence. The Malayans, skilfully led by the382THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
aristocratic Tunku Abdul Rahman, and the moder-
ate Chinese under Tan Cheng Lock formed anAlliance Party calling for independence. It won
overwhelming support in Malaya. The negotia-

tions for independence were long and drawn out,
but they reached a successful conclusion in 1957.The Federation of Malaya, independent but amember of the Commonwealth, was created.
Singapore was to receive independence separately
when it withdrew from the federation in 1965.The end of British rule and the peaceful trans-fer of power to the elected representatives of
Malaya came in 1957. The Chinese communist
guerrillas could not now credibly claim that theirs
was a struggle for independence from colonialservitude. Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tan ChengLock could no longer convincingly be pictured by
the communists as mere stooges and puppets of
the British. Their tough stand in negotiations and
their subsequent success had earned them, in the
eyes of the majority of Malayans, a reputation as
genuine patriots who had created an independent
nation. The British departed voluntarily, with the
respect and friendship of the founders of the
nation, leaving a Malaya, moreover, from which
the menace of communist violence had been vir-
tually eradicated. Britain’s greatest imperial
achievement, perhaps, was not the acquisition of
its worldwide empire, but the manner in which itgave it up. Its more realistic and far-sighted atti-tude stood in dark contrast to those of France and
the Netherlands.The British, in the end, accommodated them-selves to national aspirations in south-east Asia,despite their military superiority. The Dutch, bycontrast, were militarily weak, but refused to give
way to Indonesian nationalism until forced to
yield. Yet it was the Dutch colonisers in the nine-
teenth century who had made a critical contribu-
tion to the emergence of an Indonesian sense of
nationalism by bringing together for administra-
tive convenience the cultures and ethnic groups
of the many islands of their Dutch East Indies
empire. The dominant group, 40 per cent of the
whole, are the Javanese people, Muslims whose
ruling class could look back on an ancient andsplendid culture. Their social structure was sub-ordinated rather than destroyed by the newDutch masters.The majority of Indonesia’s large population,which had reached 60 million in 1930, lived on
the overcrowded island of Java. Living standards
were low, despite belated efforts by the Dutch toimprove the lot of the ‘natives’, and populationincreases – as elsewhere in the underdeveloped
world – outstripped improvements and depressed
living standards even further. Rice production in
Java could no longer feed the people adequately,
and the price of sugar, the principal export, collapsed in the blizzard of the world economiccrisis of the 1930s. The outer islands, much less
crowded, provided the important exports of oil
and rubber. It was these commodities, essential
to any war effort, that decided Japan to launch its‘southern drive’ of conquest and so brought itinto collision with the West.In the Dutch East Indies, the Japaneseinvaders were generally welcomed as liberators in
the spring of 1942, and the Dutch bureaucracy
quickly collapsed. The mass of the people nowturned against the traditional social structures,with the Javanese aristocracy at their apex,
through which the Dutch had ruled the islands
and imposed their policies. After years of Dutch
repression, the nationalist movement – after achequered history – surfaced more strongly thanever. Communism had failed to gain a hold,
almost entirely due to the ﬁerce repression of the
Dutch colonial government of the 1920s, which
resorted to internment and to the mass arrest of
its leaders. The continuing resentment against theDutch, however, enabled the two most outstand-ing nationalist leaders, the economist Mohammed
Hatta and the engineer Achmed Sukarno, to rally
the various nationalist movements and to win
adherents among the educated elites. Their hourseemed to have struck when the Dutch werehumiliated and defeated by the invading Japanese
army. But for the Indonesians one system of
repression was now replaced by another.Although four centuries of European rule hadat one stroke been destroyed, the new Asian ‘lib-erators’ gave no encouragement to social revolu-
tion or national experiments, let alone to1THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE383
thoughts of true independence. They left the tra-ditional social structure and simply sought towork through it as the Dutch had done. All the
same, there were now new opportunities for the
Indonesian national leadership who, the Japanese
judged, could serve a useful role in mobilisingIndonesians for the Japanese war effort. All thatreally mattered to the Japanese was to exploit the
human and material resources of the islands. They
forced the various national factions to patch up
their differences and sent the Indonesian national
leaders out to penetrate the far-ﬂung regions ofthe archipelago. Since they did not regard theDutch as their rightful masters and friends, these
leaders had no qualms about collaborating with
the Japanese. They also established links with the
anti-Japanese underground movement. Theirdream was Indonesian independence, and toachieve it the question of whether to work with
or against outside powers, be they Dutch or
Japanese, was a matter of tactics, not of loyalty to
foreign rulers. Thus Sukarno had no hesitation inenjoying good relations with the Japanese militarycommander of Java, given their mutual interests
and the reality of Japan’s supreme power. Later,
with the deterioration of their military prospects,
the Japanese found it expedient to make conces-
sions to Indonesian national feelings and topromise independence. Except brieﬂy in Java inMay 1945, and then only in outward appearance,
it was nowhere achieved under Japanese rule,
which collapsed too quickly for the changes of
policy to take effect.The Dutch and Japanese having been defeatedin turn, at last it seemed that Indonesian inde-

pendence would be achieved peacefully. Sukarno
and Hatta nevertheless knew that they faced seri-

ous internal and external obstacles. Within the
country, although the communists had not beenable effectively to reorganise themselves after theirsuppression by the Dutch, a new, youthful genera-

tion of radical leaders working for social revolution
had emerged during the Second World War. More
seriously still, British and Indian troops underMountbatten’s supreme command landed inIndonesia in September 1945, not merely to dis-

arm the Japanese but, as it soon turned out, to
restore Indonesia to Dutch rule. The Indonesianshad, however, made good use of the hiatusbetween the Japanese surrender and the arrival ofAllied troops. In August, that is a month before
the British landed, a constitution was agreed and
an independent Indonesian republic proclaimed. 
A sizeable armed militia of Indonesians, largelytrained by the Japanese, whose arms they com-
mandeered, controlled Java and were ready to
defend the republic. Nevertheless, after the British
landings Sukarno decided not to resist by force and
allowed the British to occupy Jakarta, the capital.
But Sukarno’s and Hatto’s authority was not sufﬁ-
cient to prevent the development of Indonesianresistance and in October 1945, despite their
efforts, the armed struggle became fiercer. In
November the British general in command of the
occupying force was killed by an Indonesian sniperand full-scale ﬁghting broke out, culminating in a
battle at Surabaya. No match for the British troops,
some 15,000 Indonesians died in that tragic
encounter. Bloodshed sanctified Indonesian
nationalism, and the battle of Surabaya is cele-
brated as Heroes Day in Indonesia.Struggling to recover from the effects of theSecond World War in Europe, successive Dutch
governments tenaciously attempted to resume
their colonial rule in south-east Asia. With British
help, Dutch troops despatched from Europe wereable to establish dominance over the principalcities, but the vast countryside was another
matter. The suppression of Indonesian national-
ism required far larger resources than the
Netherlands could hope to command. Nor wasinternational opinion in the United Nations or inWashington sympathetic to the Dutch. The prag-
matic British saw the Dutch struggle as wasteful
and ineffective and, after the failure of initial
attempts at pacification, concluded that the
Dutch should take the same road as the Britishwere travelling in India and Burma. More andmore isolated, the Dutch hung on. Indonesia was
of immense value with its oil and rubber, but the
Dutch found themselves in a no-win position
against the ﬁfth most populated nation in theworld, the majority of whose citizens wished to get rid of the white colonial rulers. The
Indonesians were not strong enough to force the
Dutch army out, so Indonesian nationalists were384THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
forced into a series of compromises and trials ofstrength. The British government was glad to takeadvantage of a truce in November 1946 to with-
draw completely and leave the islands to the
Indonesians and the Dutch.The Indonesian nationalists, despite makingagreements with the Dutch authorities, did allthey could to frustrate them. In 1947 the Dutch
tried, as before the war, to crush nationalist oppo-
sition by a so-called police action. In 1948 they
stepped up their military effort and attempted to
impose a federal solution which denied Indonesiasovereignty, but the Indonesian political leaderssimply would not cooperate with the Dutch. The
Netherlands was therefore faced with an unend-
ing military commitment in Indonesia which it
could not afford. Asian nationalism overcame mil-itary and economic superiority by sheer attritionin Indonesia, as later it did elsewhere in south-
east Asia. Crucial too were US threats to cut off
reconstruction aid if diverted to the war in
Indonesia. The Dutch bowed to the inevitable.In December 1949 the Dutch conceded inde-pendence to Indonesia and in August the follow-
ing year 85,000 Dutch troops and the colonial
administration withdrew. With them went several
thousand Indonesians who preferred to make the
Netherlands their home and as a result turned thehomogeneous Dutch into a multiracial society.But 1950 did not mark the end of conflict
between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The
Netherlands held on to Western New Guinea,
which the Indonesians claimed, and it still hopedfor some constitutional arrangement linkingIndonesia and the Netherlands for another
decade. A unitary Indonesian republic was not
established until 1960, and not until two years
later did the Dutch agree to hand over Western
New Guinea (or West Irian, as the Indonesianscalled it). Decolonisation thus proved a painfuland long-drawn-out process, damaging both to
the Indonesians and to the Dutch. How recently
European physical control of colonial empires was
abandoned needs to be borne in mind, for thespeed with which the bitterness abated betweenthe former colonial subjects and the European
nations is one of the most remarkable and sur-
prising aspects of twentieth-century history.The French, as empire builders in south-east Asia,were – like the Americans – late arrivals, conquer-ing Indo-China in the mid-nineteenth century.
They superimposed French rule on an ancient
Vietnamese culture with a sense of national unity
that did not diminish during the century ofFrench occupation. The Vietnamese were broughtby the French under one imperial umbrella with
the Laotians and Cambodians to form the entity
of French Indo-China. As elsewhere in the colo-
nial world the amalgamation of Western ideas and
the indigenous culture brought about rapidchanges and created divided loyalties. The better-off, the landlords, the independent farmers and
the traders, resisted far-reaching social change
and, to this extent, identiﬁed themselves with the
French administration. French education alsonourished an intelligentsia, many of whom wereinspired by Marxist ideals and committed them-
selves to an anti-colonial struggle.The French took their civilising white man’smission seriously in the south of Vietnam (CochinChina), which they administered directly; centralVietnam was less affected; in the north, around
Hanoi, some basic industrial development took
place. The French built railways and roads, a uni-
versity in Hanoi, schools and hospitals; they
increased literacy and stamped out widespreaddiseases; mortality rates fell. There was less racialarrogance than in British colonies, and a greater
promotion of education. Contact with France was
also encouraged, and a small Vietnamese elite
travelled there in the 1930s, including Ho Chi-minh. On the debit side, economic developmentin Indo-China was dictated by the interests of
metropolitan France. Industrialisation was slow.
Over-population in the two most fertile regions,
the Mekong River in the south and the Red River
in the north, was a perennial problem. The greatmajority of the 16 million Vietnamese were poorpeasants, hardest hit by the collection of rents and
taxes. The depression of the 1930s, which saw
steep declines in the price of rice and sugar, most
affected those who could least afford it and led towaves of unrest. All peasant and student protestwas met by the French with repression.A small Vietnamese Communist Party inspiredby the Russian Revolution had been formed in1THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE385
1929 by Ho Chi-minh. In the social and politicalconditions of the 1930s its potential followingwas large, and it adopted the tactics of the
popular front, softening its own revolutionary
aims in the interests of unity to win the support
of the revolutionary but non-Marxist NationalistParty, which had been suppressed by the French.Vietnamese intellectuals were both attracted 
and alienated by French culture. Proud of their
own civilisation, they discovered the hollowness
of French revolutionary egalitarianism, which
seemed to apply only to the French and not tocolonial natives. Nonetheless, the overwhelmingmilitary strength of the French gave their colonial
rule an appearance of stability and permanence. It
was to prove illusory.France’s claim to superiority in Indo-China wasshattered by her defeat in Europe in June 1940. Tothe north, the Japanese were waging their relent-

less war against China and espousing a Japanese-
dominated ‘Greater East Asia co-prosperity
sphere’. French weakness in September of that yearbrought the Japanese into Indo-China, pathway to the Dutch East Indies. The Vichy French
authorities collaborated with the Japanese and sup-

pressed nationalist guerrillas with French troops. A
serious uprising in southern Vietnam was bloodily
defeated and, in the process, the southern Vietna-
mese communist organisation was decimated. Thiswas to be of crucial importance for the future, since
the communists now remained strong only in the
north. The anti-Japanese resistance, organised in
the north by the Vietnamese nationalist League forthe Independence of Vietnam, or Vietminh, wasled by the charismatic Ho Chi-minh.Ho Chi-minh became a cult ﬁgure in his ownlifetime. Before his death in 1969 his photo-

graphic image was as widely reproduced as
Castro’s, Che Guevara’s and Mao Zedong’s. Helies buried in a glass cage within a mausoleum inHanoi and hundreds daily pay their respects. Yet
before 1945 no one in the outside world had
heard of him. As a nationalist and communist
conspirator he had used several pseudonyms in hislifetime and had travelled widely, working onboats, though between 1913 and 1917 he had
been employed in the kitchen of the London
Carlton Hotel. As a Vietnamese nationalist hebecame well known in socialist circles of Paris,and travelled to China and to Hong Kong, wherehe founded the Indo-Chinese Communist Party
with a number of fellow conspirators in 1929. He
visited Moscow in the 1920s and served as a del-
egate to various conferences, before disappearingfrom view from 1933 to 1941, when he reap-peared in Moscow. He had probably spent the
intervening years in Stalin’s Russia. There can be
no doubt that Ho Chi-minh had become a ded-
icated communist, but he was also a dedicated
nationalist.Tactically Ho Chi-minh was a chameleon,appearing to espouse many causes and roles. But
the core of his beliefs was nationalism – Vietnam as
one uniﬁed, independent nation – and Marxism.
He was a man of intellectual brilliance and a com-
plete personal incorruptibility, modest in his needs,able to relate to the common people, yet utterly
ruthless and inﬂexible in the pursuit of ultimate
aims. No price was ultimately too high to create a
united communist Vietnam, free from all outsideinterference.When Vichy French power began to bedestroyed in metropolitan France following the
Allied invasion in the summer of 1944, Ho Chi-
minh knew that the time for the power struggle
in his country was drawing closer. The Japaneseoccupiers continued to tolerate the Vichy admin-istration in Vietnam, which had collaborated with
them under duress. But on 9 March 1945 the
Japanese attempted to strengthen their position
by making a bid for popular Vietnamese support.The French administrators were unceremoniouslyimprisoned and a Vietnamese state independent
from France was brought into existence by
decree.The Japanese needed a leader to give inde-pendence some credibility in the eyes of thepeople. They turned to Bao Dai, who had beencrowned emperor in 1925 at the age of twelve.
Although he had been groomed by the French
for this role and educated in Paris, Bao Dai was
no cypher and in the 1930s had attempted to wingenuine independence for Vietnam, but withoutsuccess. He could serve as a rallying point for
unity and independence, so he was a leader of
some importance in 1945. Realising this, the386THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
Japanese prevailed on him to head an ‘independ-ent’ Vietnam in March 1945. Ho Chi-minh sawthat Bao Dai’s royal standing in the eyes of the
peasantry made him a potential rival, but decided
that it would be best to appear to recruit his
authority to the Marxist cause. Bao Dai, with noarmy to protect him, had little choice after thesurrender of the Japanese but to accept what Ho
Chi-minh demanded of him. He abdicated,
passed the Mandate of Heaven to Ho Chi-minh’s
emissaries and was appointed his supreme 
adviser.August 1945 was a critical time. What author-ity would replace the Japanese after their surren-
der on 14 August and before the French could
return? Ho Chi-minh played his cards well. The
French and Japanese had stockpiled grain; theVietminh led raids on the granaries to relieve thefamine. General Vo Nguyen Giap’s small ﬁghting
force, trained by the US to ﬁght the Japanese, was
soon in control of Hanoi and Saigon. On 2
September 1945 in Hanoi, in constitutional lan-guage borrowed from the American Declarationof Independence in 1776 and France’s revolu-
tionary Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1791,
he proclaimed the Independent Democratic
Republic of Vietnam with himself as president.
He was looking for American support. Rooseveltbefore his death had been sympathetic to Ho Chi-minh’s nationalist cause, and General Joseph
Stilwell (commander of US forces in China,
Burma and India) had supported his irregular
troops. At that time Washington was more con-cerned with the evils of colonialism in Europe’sformer empires than with the global threat of
communism. All that would change under
Truman’s administration with the onset of the
Cold War. It was not the Americans, but the
British and French, in a determined effort, whofrustrated Ho Chi-minh’s plans for a Marxistuniﬁed and independent Vietnam.The country south of the 16th parallel, that isall of southern and much of central Vietnam, fell
by earlier Allied agreement into Lord LouisMountbatten’s sphere of command. What fol-
lowed is one of the most extraordinary episodes
of the post-war period. If the south had been per-
mitted to follow the north and the independenceof the whole of Indo-China had been accepted bythe British, the trauma of the longest war in Asia,which led to at least 3.4 million deaths and untold
misery, might have been avoided. Mountbatten
personally sympathised with the Asian peoples’
desire for independence. But General DouglasGracey, the British commander sent to southernIndo-China, took a different view. He was deter-
mined not to treat with local independence
leaders in Saigon and to do all he could to restore
French rule. There were no French troops at ﬁrst
in Indo-China and Gracey had only a fewhundred Indian and British soldiers at his dis-posal. So he ‘restored order’ with the only avail-
able well-disciplined soldiers – the Japanese. Far
from disarming them, he arranged for the
Japanese divisions, with their own ofﬁcers butunder British command, to ﬁght the local southVietnamese during the summer and autumn of
1945 in a startling reversal of alliances. The
Americans could do nothing. General MacArthur
fumed: ‘If there is anything that makes my bloodboil it is to see our allies in Indo-China and Javadeploying Japanese troops to reconquer the little
people we promised to liberate.’ By Christmas
1945, some 50,000 French troops had been
brought to Indo-China to take over from the
British and Indians, who were able to withdraw.The British motivation is not difficult tounderstand. In London there was great suspicion
of American intentions: if the French were to be
deprived of their colonies in the name of libera-
tion, what claims would the British have to therestoration of their colonies in southern Asia,especially Malaya? France, furthermore, was a vital
future ally in Europe, the only potentially strong
power to defend the continent against a resurgent
Germany or a Soviet threat at a time when the
Americans were withdrawing. But the Frenchwere not likely to act in Europe with Britain ifBritain helped to deprive France of Indo-China.
Yet these all proved short-term and wrong-
headed calculations. For France, its return to
Indo-China was to lead to defeat and humiliation;and the Americans, who eventually replaced theFrench, were ironically to suffer here their only
defeat in war and even greater humiliation. The
Vietnamese suffered most of all.1THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE387
War did not break out immediately between theFrench and the Vietminh in the north. By thespring of 1946, the French had taken control of
the south and had negotiated the withdrawal of
the Chinese from the north. Chiang Kai-shek
complied, because he needed his troops in China;Ho Chi-minh, who was not ready at this junctureto start ﬁghting, agreed to allow a small French
force to enter the north in return for French
recognition of the Vietnamese Republic he had
proclaimed. The French further stipulated that
the Vietnamese Republic should remain withinthe French Union. This was a compromise thatcould never last. The French had excluded the
southernmost part of Vietnam from their recog-
nition of independence in the north, which in any
case was so circumscribed that it would not haveamounted to true independence. Ho Chi-minhtravelled to Paris, where negotiations for a ﬁrm
settlement broke down. He then returned to
Hanoi and claimed independence for a united
Vietnam. In November 1946 the French openedhostilities, by shelling the northern port ofHaiphong and killing 6,000 Vietnamese civilians.
In December full-scale ﬁghting broke out.The French sent growing numbers of troopsfrom Europe to reinforce the southern Vietnamese
levies. Bao Dai had escaped from Ho Chi-minh’sgroup and took refuge ﬁrst in Hong Kong, then
on the Côte d’Azur, where he enjoyed a life of lux-

ury. In March 1949 the president of France and
Emperor Bao Dai signed a treaty granting Vietnam
independence though reserving all eventual rightsto the French, but Bao Dai’s government was tooobviously subordinated to France to gain respect in
the West. Nonetheless, the French appeared to be
well in control during the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the con-

ﬂict. From 1946 to 1950, with Giap building up
his hopelessly outnumbered Vietminh in the RedRiver valley of fertile rice ﬁelds in the north, there
was relatively little ﬁghting. But the skill, discipline

and ﬁghting spirit of his force, which by 1954 had
grown to 117,000, proved more than a match for
the 100,000 French Foreign Legion soldiers sup-
ported by 300,000 Vietnamese.The victory of the Chinese Communists in1949 transformed Giap’s prospects, as large mil-
itary supplies including heavy artillery were soonspeeding south to support him. Mao’s victory andthe outbreak of the Korean War also transformedWashington’s attitude: between 1950 and 1954
the US provided France with about $3 billion to
enable it to carry on the war. But, despite their
early successes, the French discovered they couldnot crush the Vietminh. Their own casualties,90,000 dead and wounded by the close of 1952,
were arousing increasing criticism at home. In
Vietnam the death of France’s one brilliant tacti-
cian, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, left its
strategy in the hands of generals who were notthe equals of General Giap, with little idea howto combat peasants being politically indoctrinated
and militarily trained to ﬁght a revolutionary war.
In 1953 Giap lured the French into defending
Dien Bien Phu. When his forces eventually out-numbered the French garrison of 13,000 men byalmost four to one and his artillery commanded
the heights surrounding the French emplace-

ment, Giap destroyed the garrison and took Dien
Bien Phu on 7 May 1954. Like the fall ofSingapore to the Japanese, this was a great Asianvictory over a European-led colonial army, and
one that changed history. The communist
Vietnamese had won, not only a battle, but the
war against the French – yet complete political
victory was still denied to them.The news reached the Geneva Conference,which had been in session since 26 April. The US
would not fully participate. But Zhou Enlai repre-
sented China, a China determined to demonstrate
reasonableness in the hope of removing America’sprincipal European allies, Britain and France, fromthe Cold War in Asia. Eden presided and to the
bitter disappointment of the Vietnamese – both
the communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam
and the Republic of Vietnam in the south – it
suited China to maintain the partition of Vietnam,thus keeping it too weak to resume its traditionalhostility to China. With the communists sustained
in the north, moreover, the Americans, who had
supported the French and the Republic of
Vietnam in the south, would be kept at armslength from China’s southern frontier. Electionswere planned for the summer of 1956 which were
intended to unify the country: Zhou Enlai was
shrewd enough to realise that, given the hostility388THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
of the two Vietnam regimes towards each other,they would never take place. The French were sat-isﬁed at having found a way out of the quagmire.
The British could bask in the role of peacemakers
on the world stage. But the Americans were hos-
tile, rightly sceptical about communist promises,and warned against a resumption of ﬁghting fromthe north. But they too had compromised in
accepting a frontier drawn, not on the borders of
China, but dividing Vietnam at the 17th parallel.
Even so it seemed that another Korean situation
had been created, with a clearly deﬁned territoriallimit on the extent of communist power.That, however, proved an illusion. The twoVietnams were more realistic: the struggle for unity
was not over. Both sides would have to prepare for
it, Ho Chi-minh in the north, but who in thesouth? Bao Dai was too weak now that his Frenchprotectors had departed. The Americans wantedsomeone tougher and more single-minded. Theybacked Ngo Dinh Diem, a nationalist and member
of a leading Catholic family, who had already
proved his patriotic credentials when opposing
French interference in the 1930s. He had travelled,living in France and then ascetically in a Catholicseminary in the US. In 1954 Bao Dai recalled him
and made him prime minister. In 1955 he ousted
Bao Dai and, in a rigged referendum, established
the Vietnam Republic with himself as president.
An implacable enemy of communism, autocraticand corrupt, Diem refused to accept the Genevasettlement as ﬁnal. South Vietnam had not signed

anything beyond a ceaseﬁre. Ho Chi-minh too was

biding his time before renewing the struggle for
the unity of Vietnam under Marxist rule. Peace didnot have a chance.1THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE389
To any schoolboy the Indian subcontinentappeared to form a natural unity. But, even under
the glittering panoply of the viceroy, that unity
was never really achieved. India remained a patch-work; some regions came under direct British rulewhile more than 360 princely states, a few – such
as Hyderabad – large and others small, were
allowed a substantial measure of internal self-
government. The princes occupied a special place.When aristocracy still mattered, the Indianmaharajas – displaying their wealth ostentatiouslyand sending their sons to Eton and Harrow –
became part of the British upper crust, or almost.
So did the opposition to the Raj. The best-known
Indian nationalists, Mohandas KaramchandGandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Muhammad AliJinnah, were members of the English Bar. There
was not only opposition to British rule but also
Anglo-Indian cooperation. In the lower branches
of administration, Indians and Anglo-Indians
were providing efﬁcient and loyal service. The
best example of Indian unity was the Indian army.Racist yet loyal, it was for long exclusively ofﬁ-
cered by the British; not until the 1930s were
Indians given commissions. Moreover, it incor-
porated all the divisive religious cultures of theIndian subcontinent: Nepalese Gurkhas, Sikhs,Muslims and Hindus were all imbued with a ﬁerce
loyalty to their regiments and to the Crown.What would happen to the patchwork ofBritish India once the unifying Crown and theinstitutions that supported it disappeared withindependence? That was the crucial questionfacing the British and the Indians in the 1940s.
Gandhi’s vision was of an India where all its inhab-
itants would be brothers. It seemed only naturalthat British India should be replaced by the oneCommonwealth of India. But during the century
of British rule the deep divisions grew deeper.
Only by force and bloodshed was it possible to
create two states in 1947, and nationalism con-
tinued to threaten the cohesion of these two suc-cessor nations, India and Pakistan. In 1971, theeastern region of Pakistan fought for and gained
independence as Bangladesh; now the subconti-
nent had divided into three political units.Religion has been a prime cause of division.Hinduism is the religion of the majority ofIndians, but there are many different kinds.
Hinduism professes, but does not always practise,
broad tolerance, and it can embrace many differ-
ent religious practices; Hindus are opposed to the
assertions of exclusive truth made by many otherreligions. But it is precisely these all-embracingHindu claims that are seen as a threat to those
religions that base their faith on providing a
speciﬁc path to salvation. Muslims are the largest
of these minorities, numbering 120 million, aquarter of all the Indian population in 1947 ofsome 480 million. The next largest minority were
12 million Christians. The Christians of Kerala in
southern India are poor and have supported the
Communist Party. The principal challenges toIndian unity in the 1990s, however, came fromChapter 34INDIAFROM THE RAJ TO INDEPENDENCE, 1947the militant Sikhs of northern India and thepeoples of Kashmir. In 1947 the main enemy ofthe Sikhs was the Muslims, from whom they
derive some of their religious practices. But since
independence the 7.5 million Sikhs have asserted
rights of independence from India’s Hindus aswell. The home of the Sikhs is the Punjab innorthern India, while the majority of Muslims live
in north-western India and in the east. They are
divided by the large central Indian land mass,
which is predominantly Hindu. But minority
communities of Hindus and Muslims are to befound throughout India and Pakistan. Bengal inthe east had mixed Muslim and Hindu commu-
nities; the Punjab in the north is also mixed reli-
giously between Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs.
Some twenty major languages divide India, aswell as the 3,000 castes and sub-castes ofHinduism; the landlord is divided from the
peasant; the wealthy merchant and factory owner
from the worker, and the bureaucracy and gov-
ernment have their own grades of inﬂuence. Thehundreds of princes great and small contributedfurther to this fragmentation. It was Britain’s
imperial power that provided whatever unity
India enjoyed before independence.Racial prejudice marred British India beforeindependence as it marred South Africa. It wascondemned by the more enlightened Englishmen,among whom was Lord Salisbury, prime minister
in 1900. Replying to the governor of Bombay, he
wrote:it interests me to ﬁnd that you are struck withthe damned nigger element in the British
society at Bombay. It is bad enough in ofﬁcial
and military circles here. I look upon it as not
only offensive and unworthy but as represent-
ing what is now and will be ... a serious polit-
ical danger!A generation later, Nehru in his Discovery ofIndia, which he wrote in 1943, expressed his ownanger at the racial discrimination of notices placedin railway carriages, on the walls of waiting roomsand even attached to park benches, with the
insulting message ‘For Europeans only’. Nehru
comments:the idea of a master race is inherent in imper-ialism. There was no subterfuge about it; it was proclaimed in unambiguous language by
those in authority. ... generation after gener-

ation, and year after year, India as a nation andIndians as individuals were subjected to insult,humiliation, and contemptuous treatment. ...

The memory of it hurts, and what hurts still
more is the fact that we submitted for so longto this degradation.Where did the balance lie between the harmdone and the beneﬁts brought by imperial rule?Economic arguments are ﬁnely balanced and whatmight have developed without British rule
becomes a hypothetical judgement. Among the
beneﬁts can be enumerated the creation of a com-mon language of government throughout India,the establishment of law and order, the building of
a railway network spanning the continent, the
beginnings of industry and its protection after theFirst World War, the development of higher edu-cation, the training of a civil service and an army,
vast irrigation schemes, the better control of
famines when the vagaries of the weather deci-mated agricultural production except on occasionslike 1943, better health care and control of the
killer diseases. But India was not a blank sheet that
Britain ‘modernised’. British rule was imposed on
an ancient civilisation whose intellectual elite hadproduced philosophers, poets, historians, writers,artists and scientists of world renown, men such as
Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941), poet, philo-
sopher and early advocate of international under-standing based on respect and knowledge of thedifferent cultures of the world, and the physicist
C. V. Raman, awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930.
One failure of British rule, by way of contrast, wasthe illiteracy of the masses.That the resentment of British imperialism andthe manipulation of India’s economic develop-
ment to suit British interests should create anationalist reaction was inevitable given thegrowth of an Indian elite and middle class in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Nevertheless,
the British did not attempt to crush independentIndian political activities.With all their arrogance and prejudice there wasalso a genuine desire for reform, for involving1INDIA391
Indians increasingly in the governing of the country, while reserving to the British Crown, thatis the viceroy, only what were regarded as the 
powers necessary to preserve British rule. Parlia-
mentary-type institutions and elections – at ﬁrst

conﬁned to a small electorate and later widened –provided the basis for constitutional developmentafter independence. The full scope of constitu-

tional progress under British rule cannot be
detailed here, but the salient measures were incor-

porated in the Indian Councils Act 1909, also
known as the Morley–Minto reforms, which per-
mitted Indians to be elected to the viceroy’s coun-
cil and to provincial councils. Eight years later the
growing demands of the Indian National Congress
(founded in 1885) led Edwin Montague, secretary
of state for India, to promise to increase the asso-
ciation of Indians ‘in every branch of the adminis-
tration, (and to promote) the gradual development
of self-governing institutions, with a view to the
progressive realisation of responsible government
in India as an integral part of the Empire’. It wasnot exactly independence, and self-governmentwas gradual indeed – it was to take another thirty
years before it became reality. Then came the
Montague–Chelmsford report in 1918 which
devolved more responsibilities upon the provincial
assemblies when the reforms began to be imple-
mented in 1921.The 1920s and 1930s under British rule werepaved with good intentions. India would be led to
independence gradually by means designed to pre-

vent the radical Congress Party with its democraticand socialist aspirations from gaining dominantpower. The princes, Britain’s loyal allies, would be
given a prominent place and Muslim and Sikh fears
of a Hindu majority would be appeased by the
grant of considerable autonomy and separate elec-

toral rolls. Long experience of imperial rule gavethe British self-conﬁdence in the exercise of their
‘trusteeship’. But some of India’s leaders wanted
more rapid progress to independence than Britain
was disposed to grant, among them Gandhi. The
British vice-regal government in India and theCabinet at home found it increasingly puzzlingand difﬁcult to know how best to deal with this
small, skinny man in a loincloth, half saint, half
shrewd politician, who moved the Indian masses asno one had done before, who deﬁed the power of
the Raj by encouraging civil disobedience to showthat Britain’s rule lacked legitimacy, and who met
the use of force by passive resistance.Gandhi, once a dapper lawyer, had spent manyyears in South Africa, where racial discriminationhad ﬁrst aroused his anger and where he had
evolved the new methods of harnessing ‘people
power’ to overcome the apparently unassailable
might of imperial white rule. British rule in India
was met by this powerful non-violent deﬁance ofthe masses, inspired by Gandhi’s example.The viceroys, responsible for upholding theimperial law, for security and order, tried to avoid
violence, preferring to govern through coopera-

tion. Gandhi was not satisﬁed with the promised
pace of British reforms, nor with the nationalism ofthe elitist Congress Party, which had little contact
with the masses. He achieved the contact by
arranging a protest against British laws designed to
combat terrorism and to raise taxes (for it was theIndians themselves who had to pay for the admin-

atmosphere in which rebellion seemed possible the
British commanding ofﬁcer in Amritsar overre-

acted, committing an atrocity by ordering histroops to ﬁre on the crowd, killing more than 300and wounding another thousand. For Gandhi this
act of bloody violence changed his outlook: there
could no longer be cooperation with the British
Raj. By a campaign of non-violent civil disobedi-

ence India would be made ungovernable.Gandhi was imprisoned for a time, the ﬁrst ofseveral arrests. In 1930 he led the famous salt
march 240 miles to the coast in deﬁance of the
government’s salt tax. Picking up a handful of
sand on the seashore, he boiled it to extract thesalt. By this simple act he demonstrated that saltcould be obtained from nature with no need to
pay the British Raj for it. His deﬁance reverber-
ated throughout India. He was arrested again,
only to be released later and sympatheticallyreceived by the viceroy. He created a sensationwhen attending, in his loincloth, a conference on
reforms in London in 1931. A renewal of civil dis-
obedience in India led to another spell in prison.
The popular British press might derisively refer to
Gandhi as the Indian ‘fakir’, but in officialLondon and Delhi he was regarded with amixture of irritation and admiration for the power
he wielded by his simple example; the Indians
called him Mahatma, ‘great soul’.In the 1930s Britain tried again to advanceIndian representation. The Government of IndiaAct was passed in 1935. The Raj, after the civil dis-

obedience campaigns of the 1920s and 1930s, had
become convinced that preparation for Indian
independence had to be taken seriously. The Act
of 1935 set up eleven British Indian provinceswith their own elected parliaments and limitedcontrol over their affairs. The religious communal
groups would be placed on different electoral reg-
isters. A federal Indian state was the goal, with the
princely states free to join or not. Meanwhile theviceroy reserved crucial powers to himself and, atthe centre, the nationalist Indian politicians would
have only limited inﬂuence. It looked like a work-
able compromise from the British point of view,but to the leaders of the Indian National Congressthe centre would be too weak, the viceroy’s pow-ers negated the demand for Indian independence
and the veto the conservative princes were to be
allowed would condemn India to a patchwork of
federated and independent states. Indian national-ists suspected that the British, acting on the age-old principle of ‘divide and rule’, were deliberately
encouraging religious and princely separation.
Only the provincial assemblies were elected in
1937 and only that part of the Act came into
force. This was nevertheless the start of the demo-cratic parliamentary process in India and therestricted electorate of some 35 million voters
overwhelmingly returned Congress members to
the provincial assemblies; local administrations
were then formed. But how little genuine powerhad been devolved soon became evident. Whenthe viceroy in 1939 simply declared India to be at
war after Britain’s own declaration of war on
Germany, Indian national leaders were not even
consulted. The provincial ministries resigned. ButCongress had meanwhile grown in power, with alegitimate electoral base – and so had the Muslim
League, of which Jinnah was president.After the outbreak of war in 1939 the viceroy ofIndia had to revert to direct rule, since Congressled by Gandhi and Nehru had refused their coop-eration and had brought the constitutional
advances of the Government of India Act, which
they hated, to an end. India’s reaction to the out-
break of war in Europe and the Middle East, aﬁght for survival for the mother country, wassplit. On the one hand, the nationalist politicians
were uncooperative; on the other, the Indian
army fought with bravery and distinction under
British and Indian ofﬁcers far away from home,
in the Middle East, in North Africa and later inItaly. Their loyalty was never in doubt.With the sudden Japanese attack on Malaya inDecember 1941, British, Commonwealth and
Indian troops fought together; tens of thousands
were inhumanely treated in Japanese prisoncamps, beaten, starved and killed. For the Indiansoldiers the Japanese offered an escape, to join an
Indian liberation army sponsored by the Japanese.
Even when the only major Indian nationalist who1INDIA393
had thrown in his lot with Germany and Japan,Subhas Chandra Bose, attempted to win recruits,the majority of Indian prisoners preferred to share
the appalling hardships with their British com-
rades, rather than gain their liberty and tolerable
living conditions by reneging. It is remarkable evi-dence of the loyalty and pride that ordinaryIndians felt for their regiment and ﬂag. The Indian
nationalist politicians reacted differently and saw
an opportunity to push forward independence at a
time when the British Empire was hard pressed.Congress leaders had come to the conclusionthat the moment was ripe to force the British Rajto give up its control of India, but they had no
intention of exchanging their British overlords for
Japanese conquerors. If Japan attacked from
Burma, Congress leaders would organise theresistance of free India with its allies in the UnitedNations military coalition, including of course the
Commonwealth. The Japanese in Burma were
checked and remained on the defensive until
1944. Gandhi and Nehru and Congress wereanxious to prevent a British transfer of powerwhich would allow the conservative princes and
the Muslim League separate powers. This would,
they believed, only lead to a feudal, federal India
in which religious fanaticism would open the way
to communal strife and violence. Jinnah hadalready declared that the aim of the MuslimLeague was an independent Pakistan. The princes
would attempt to hang on to their power and so
frustrate Nehru’s and Gandhi’s vision of an India
united, a progressive India socially reformed,caste discrimination gone, a secular India strivingfor religious harmony, a democratic India accept-
ing elected representative forms of government.With Japan at the gates, the British were deeplyworried that Indian loyalty could not be counted
on. In the spring of 1942 Sir Stafford Cripps wassent to offer India independence after the war wasover, but to appease Islamic aspirations the
Muslims would be given the option of secession if
they wished. This condition made certain the
rejection of the offer by the Congress leadership,who would in turn have had to promise supportfor the war. The Congress leaders were not to be
cajoled into a government powerless under the
viceroy, thus indicating that they accepted imper-ial rule. For Congress another vital objection wasthat acceptance would encourage the Muslimsafter the war to divide India and set up their own
state. They suspected that Britain wished to divide
and rule. The British appeared to be more con-
cerned with retaining the loyalty of the Muslimsduring the war. In August 1942 Congress launch-ed the ‘Quit India’ campaign. The viceroy then
put an end to all debate. He decided that the 
only safe thing to do was to intern the political
leaders of the Congress Party, including Gandhi,
to prevent them from continuing to spread disaf-fection throughout India. The silencing of theCongress politicians enabled Jinnah’s Muslim
League greatly to strengthen its position. The
momentum for the partition of India and the cre-
ation of Pakistan was henceforth not to be halted.By August 1945 with the defeat of bothGermany and Japan, the curtain was about to fall
on the ﬁnal act. Churchill, who was reluctant to
‘scuttle’ out of empire, had been replaced by
Attlee and a Labour government. Labour sharednone of Churchill’s historical sentimentality. Theviceroy, Viscount Wavell, was soon to discover
this. During 1943 and 1944 his hands had been
tied by London, who were afraid that talks with
Indian nationalists would sow disaffection. At this
very time, masked by government suppression ofnews, the worst human disaster to befall India inthe twentieth century occurred. The Bengal
Famine claimed 3 million victims. There was
bureaucratic mismanagement, a failure to trans-
port food hoarded to feed the army; Burmesesupplies were cut. This disaster further fuelleddemands for independence.In 1946, Field Marshal Lord Wavell toldLondon either to strengthen the army to keep
peace until all Indian parties had agreed to an
independent government of India in which theywould share power, or for Britain to withdrawfrom India province by province, disclaiming
responsibility for the bloody consequences of
communal strife which was bound to follow its
departure. This was truly Hobson’s choice. Whathad led the viceroy to such bleak conclusions?Wavell’s attempts to arrive at compromises
among Indian political leaders promised no early
success, especially after the breakdown of talks394THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
between them at the Simla Conference of June1945; a British Cabinet mission to India in March1946 came no nearer to success. But this time it
was not just a question of a conference of squab-
bling politicians in India. To show the strength
of Muslim feelings and to protest at the tactics ofCongress, Jinnah called for a Direct Action Dayon 16 August. Fanatics stoked up communal vio-
lence and in Calcutta alone there were 20,000
casualties of the riots.So ended the last prospects of a ‘united India’;it was the end too of the Wavell plan as far as theLabour government was concerned. It was willingneither to take the blame for leaving India in a
state of chaos nor to pour the resources into India
that were necessary if time for a solution was to
be won. If Britain could no longer guarantee lifeand order from outbreaks of massive communalviolence, something drastic had become neces-
sary. In February 1947 Wavell was recalled. He
was replaced by a ‘royal’, a soldier of even greater
fame, Viscount Mountbatten, until then thecharismatic and successful supreme commander insouth-east Asia; in an attempt to make the Indians
accept responsibility for the consequences of their
disputes, a deﬁnite date, June 1948, was ﬁxed for
the transfer of power.The Mountbattens arrived in Delhi on 22 March1947 with all the pomp due to a viceroy and con-
sort. No viceroy’s wife had ever made so deep animpression on Indians as Edwina Mountbatten,who threw herself into support for welfare andhealth programmes at a time of turbulence and
misery for so many. Mountbatten began a weary
process of talks with Pandit Nehru and the other
leaders of Congress and with Mohammed Jinnah,representing the Muslim League. Gandhi was lit-tle involved. He used his remaining strength – he
was now an old and frail man in his mid-seventies
– to try to halt the mounting religious conﬂicts
between Hindu and Muslims. The last two years
of his life, devoted to humanity, were the mostgenuinely saintly.Mountbatten got on well with the urbane andwarm Nehru; Jinnah he found negative and for-
bidding. The Muslim leader fought for the under-
dog, the numerically weaker and dispersed 100million Muslims outnumbered by Hindus three toone; and his intransigence would ﬁnally convince
the British and the Congress leaders to abandon
their cherished hopes for a united India and com-
pel them to accept an independent Pakistan. Eventhen they would seek to weaken and conﬁne a‘moth-eaten’ Pakistan to such frontiers as would
make its viability and continued independence
highly questionable after the transfer of power.
Jinnah reﬂected Muslim suspicions of the good
intentions of the Hindu majority, inﬂuenced bybitter memories of discrimination culturally, polit-ically and economically; a uniﬁed, secular, cen-
tralised India, he feared, would simply perpetuate1INDIA395
7 June 1947. LordMountbatten, viceroy ofIndia, discloses Britains partition plan insisted on by

regions was anathema to Nehru and the Congress
leaders, who believed it would be ungovernable.Well aware of mounting tensions, Mountbattencalculated that the best chance of a peaceful trans-
fer and agreement between the leaders lay in mak-

ing them face a short deadline. He announced that
the transfer would take place not in over a year, but
in just six months on 15 August 1947. Nehru and
Jinnah, Congress and the Muslim League wouldhave to reach a practical solution for partition orthey would be responsible for chaos on the date of
transfer. Brought to the edge of catastrophe the
Indian leaders were forced to accept the implica-

tions of Mountbatten’s timetable and the plan henow put on the table. This involved partition butwith the mixed Muslim–Hindu Punjab and Bengal
provinces being allowed to choose which way they
wished to go. They too voted for partition. A
British jurist headed a commission which was giventhe task of demarcating the frontiers of India andPakistan. The princes of the 562 states in 1947
were left to make the best terms they could with
one or the other of the successor states to the
British Raj.Even if Muslim and Congress leaders hadaccepted the demarcation between the two statesarrived at by the commission, immense practical
problems would still have had to be overcome.
The uniﬁed administration, police force, army and
treasury would all need to be split up. Most ofindustry was located within those parts of Indiawhere Hindus were in a majority; the economy
and communications would be dislocated. Would
the break-up into two nations heighten tensions
between Hindus and Muslims and lead to
renewed violence and strife? It was clear from theoutset that the creation of Pakistan was bound toentail the division of Bengal in the east and the
Punjab in the north with one predominantly
Muslim part being incorporated in Pakistan and
the Hindu-majority districts going to India. Yetthe Muslim and Hindu populations were mixedthroughout the subcontinent, with millions living
on the ‘wrong’ side of any partition line that
could be devised. The Punjab was a powder-kegof conﬂict, for here another minority of militantSikhs saw an opportunity as a result of partitionof becoming a majority and even gaining their
own state of Khalistan. Communal suspicions,
resentments and hatreds would not need much
provocation to set the subcontinent alight.
Bengal, the Punjab, Delhi and Calcutta were par-
ticular areas of danger at a time when the loyalty
of the army and the police would be gravely
weakened by the transfer of power. Gandhi could
not permanently put out the ﬂames of religious
and ethnic hatred and himself fell victim to the
bullets of a Hindu extremist, who shot him at a
prayer meeting on 30 January 1948. Ethnic and
religious strife and bloodshed not only in Indiaand Pakistan but throughout the world hasproved the hardest to halt, the most resistant to
the supposed progress of civilisation.Bloody communal violence had also erupted inthe Punjab. Jinnah, Nehru, Gandhi and the lead-
ers of Congress had been aware of the dangers
ahead and were determined to avoid them or at
least to contain violence. Reports from the Punjab
before partition clearly warned of the likelihood 
of conﬂict, and preventive plans were drawn up. 
A British ofﬁcered force (which included Gurkhas)
of some 55,000 men was available to preserve law
and order in the Punjab. But the scale of the vio-
lence that would follow on partition was not fullyanticipated in Delhi and was to stain the transferof power with the blood of many hundreds of
thousands of innocent victims.Independence Day in Pakistan on 14 Augustand in India on 15 August passed off with cele-
brations and praise for Mountbatten and the
British. Jinnah publicly acknowledged that ‘such
voluntary and absolute transfer of power and rule
by one nation over others is unknown in the
whole history of the world’. He wished to live in
amity with his neighbour. Yet the celebrations
were hardly over before the tragedy of the trans-
fer became manifest and relations between India
and Pakistan were deeply scarred and damaged fordecades to come. The demarcation of the frontierhad been announced on 16 August. The militant
section of the Sikhs then set upon the Muslims,
killing and raping and destroying their homes.396THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
How great the loss of life was has never been evenroughly established; it was on a huge scale.During August and September, between200,000 and half a million Muslims ﬂeeing the
Indian half of east Punjab lost their lives. No
mercy was shown to unarmed men, women and
children. Even trains overcrowded with refugeeswere halted and the passengers murdered in coldblood. The local authorities either looked on or
were powerless to stop the massacres. Pakistan
never forgave. It was evident that the onslaught
had been planned, the Pakistanis believed, withthe foreknowledge of Delhi. Gandhi and Nehru,now India’s prime minister, were horriﬁed. There
were killings too on the Pakistan side on a smaller
scale. Certainly the Muslim League was also anx-
ious to drive out the Sikhs and Hindus from what
became Pakistan by organising riots. Millions ofrefugees crossed the frontier in opposite directionsto India and Pakistan with nothing but what they
stood up in. Communal riots spread to Delhi,
where more killings of the Muslim minority
occurred. Gandhi hastened to Calcutta to stop theriots in Bengal. There he announced a fast to thedeath, and so great was his moral stature that
large-scale killings did cease. But in the Punjab the
Sikhs were deliberately expelling their Muslim
neighbours so that they might at last gain power.It is obvious that force and organised terrorwere required to drive people despairingly fromtheir homes, their farms and their plots of land
where they had lived for generations. They did
not move willingly before the Independence
Days. In West Pakistan only a small minority ofHindus remained. In East Pakistan (Bengal) asubstantial number of the 30 million Hindus
stayed. From India some 9 to 10 million Muslim
refugees had crossed over to West or East
Pakistan, yet millions of Muslims stayed, remain-ing the largest minority among 340 millionIndians. Communal rioting and killings recurred
in later years, but never again on the horriﬁc scale
of 1947. Nor did Sikhs and Hindus in the eastern
Punjab peacefully coexist. While Sikh hatred of
Pakistan secured the Indian frontier from anydanger of internal subversion in any conﬂict withPakistan, Sikh militants – because they consti-
tuted only a minority of some 10 million – havestridently and at times violently sought autonomyand independence. This stems from their fears oflosing their identity, their way of life.In an atmosphere of bitterness Pakistan andIndia only a few weeks after independence became
embroiled in conﬂict over the future of a princely
state bordering on both northern India and
Pakistan – Kashmir and Jammu. The ruling
Maharaja vacillated, refusing to opt for either
Pakistan or India. He was a Hindu, though the
majority of the population was Muslim. The key
ﬁgure in Kashmir was not the Maharaja but SheikhMohammed Abdullah, the leader of a party notdivided on religious lines and in agreement with
the Congress leaders in India. Pakistan attempted
to force the issue and encouraged Pathan tribes-

men to invade Kashmir, which they almost suc-

ceeded in occupying. The Maharaja ﬂed to India,

where in return for a promise of Indian military
assistance he agreed, without consulting his people
or the political leaders, that his state should accede
to India. Nehru sent in troops and promised to
allow the people to choose their own future in a
referendum. In Kashmir both Hindus and Muslims
looking to Sheikh Abdullah resisted the Pathans
and the idea of absorption by Pakistan, whichclaimed Kashmir on the ground that it had aMuslim majority. Abdullah was after all a close
friend and admirer of Nehru, sharing with him the
Indian ideal of a secular state in which Muslim and
Hindu could live peaceably together. The Indians
and Kashmiris now pushed the Pathans back, only
for Pakistan to intervene with its own regular
troops. Nehru, meanwhile, weakened his case by
not implementing his promise to hold a plebiscite.
With the two new states on the brink of war, the
United Nations intervened, and on 1 January 1949
a truce line was established which left two-thirds of
Kashmir in Indian hands and one-third with
Pakistan. Nehru was deeply disappointed by thisinjustice. It was not the end of the Kashmir prob-
lem, nor did it settle Indian–Pakistani hostilities.
Basic to these was the suspicion for decades of the
Islamic Pakistani leadership that secular India
would, one day, seek to reunite the subcontinent
and destroy Pakistan’s hard-won independence
and religious culture.1INDIA397
Once carried to power in 1949, the communistswere able to establish effective rule over the main-
land of China and end the warfare that had torn
the country apart since the ﬁrst decades of thetwentieth century. Chinese sovereignty was soonextended to the offshore islands and in 1950
forcibly to Tibet. Only Taiwan and a few other
small islands remained outside the control of the
new Chinese Republic. There, Chiang Kai-shek,
vowing anew each year to continue the civil war,established a separate state by occupying theislands with his ﬂeeing army. Taiwan (Formosa),
together with the Pescadores and the tiny islands
of Quemoy and Matsu, continue to represent the
other China. However, the possibility of renew-ing the civil war has long ago vanished. ThePeople’s Republic has ceased to be shunned by
the West and its representative has taken his place
as a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council. Even the brutal suppression of
the movement, largely of students and youngpeople, crushed so bloodily in Tiananmen Squarein 1989, isolated the Chinese communist leader-
ship from the West for only a short time. Today
China beneﬁts from huge Japanese and Western
investment.The father of Chinese communism was MaoZedong. The China he knew in his youth had
been exploited and invaded in turn by foreign
nations – Britain, France, Russia, Germany and
Japan – in the nineteenth century and during theﬁrst half of the twentieth. The Chinese Republicfounded and presided over by Sun Yat-sen wastoo weak to halt foreign depredation, and mod-
ernisation efforts made slow progress in the face
of the hugeness of China’s problems, the back-wardness of the overwhelmingly peasant popula-tion and the decades of incessant warfare.This was the China Mao Zedong had known allhis adult life. He was born in 1893, just two years
before Japan’s ﬁrst victory over China in war had
added to its humiliating record of defeats by theEuropeans. His father, through thrift and bymeans of lending his savings at usurious rates,
amassed what was for a peasant modest wealth.
Mao worked on his father’s farm, collected his
father’s loans and, taught by a tutor, read widely.In the turbulent last years of the Manchu dynastyand during the revolution of 1911 that followed,
Mao gained ﬁrst-hand experience of the poverty
and distress of the peasantry, and felt the stirrings
of social revolt and patriotism of these years. For a
short time he became a soldier in the service of therevolution. Like other Chinese progressives, heavidly read Western books to gain the new know-
ledge that the progressives believed would save
China. But as Mao later remarked, ‘Imperialist
aggression shattered the fond dreams of theChinese about learning from the West. It was veryodd – why were the teachers always committing
aggression against their pupil?’The Russian Revolution then brought a newlearning to China, Marxism–Leninism. Mao wasan enthusiastic supporter of the May the FourthChapter 35CHINATHE END OF CIVIL WAR AND THE VICTORY OF
THE COMMUNISTSMovement (1919), demonstrating and rising inprotests against both the conservative society andforeign subjugation. His patriotic and radical
views soon led him beyond the May the Fourth
Movement to Marxism and, in 1921, joining the
Chinese Communist Party. For all his adaptationsof this doctrine to Chinese conditions, Maoremained faithful to the basic tenets of Marxism–
Leninism all his life. He would later claim that it
was Russia after Stalin’s death that was departing
from the course prescribed by Marx, Lenin and
the younger Stalin and that the mantle of theworld leadership of the true faith had passed toChina. But the sense of world mission did not
exclude a strong feeling for China’s unique
national identity. The world would be trans-

formed not by Chinese conquests but by theChinese example and the successful struggle ofthe suppressed masses of other nations.Through all the turmoil of ﬁghting against hisChinese opponents from 1927 onwards and then
against the Japanese too, Mao’s vision was of aChina that would be reborn ‘powerful and pros-perous’, a ‘people’s republic worthy of the name’.
Mao hated his enemies with passion, could act
with bitter ruthlessness to destroy opponents but
was also able with brilliant tactical good sense to
persuade and cajole, to divide the opposition andso to emerge the strongest. For Mao, China’sfuture required the mass mobilisation of the peas-
antry, the vast majority of Chinese citizens, and
he believed that the application of Marxist–
Leninist doctrines would transform their lives.The social classes which could not place the goodof the community before their individualistic
desire for gain might be reformed, but if that
failed they would be destroyed. At the root of the
social revolution, Mao observed, lay a revolution
of the human spirit. This would occur not byitself, but only through unremitting class struggleand the teaching of the masses.Mao repeatedly warned that perseverance wasnecessary to bring about the socialist economic
revolution but that this would not be enough,that it was necessary also ‘to carry on constant andarduous socialist revolutionary struggles and
socialist education on the political and ideologi-
cal fronts’. His ideology was fanatical; in hispursuit of it, millions would die and suffer.Marxism–Leninism provided Mao both with themeans to be adopted and the ends which would
thereby be achieved. The disciplined party – the
party groups, the cadres, sent to convert the
masses community by community – was the basicmethod used in the Soviet Union and later inChina too. In China, Mao concentrated on the
countryside, the poor peasantry, driven to increas-
ing desperation by the combination of the natural
and human depredations afﬂicting China in the
1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Village associations,youth movements, student federations, women’sorganisations and other societies had millions of
members after 1949 and served as the means of
linking the central authorities with the masses.
But no mercy would be shown to those identi-ﬁed as the enemies of the people. Violent deathon a huge scale was nothing new to Chinese
history. Mao pursued his vision of utopia regard-
less of human cost.The October Revolution in Russia had beenspearheaded by the industrial proletariat. Mao’scontribution to revolutionary theory, it is often
claimed, is that he relied on the peasantry: to sur-
round the towns with the countryside and then
to conquer them – that was the model of the
Chinese revolution. For Mao, however, this wasa matter not of inventing a new doctrine but ofpractical necessity. He had to rely on safety in
remoteness and on the peasantry for the recruits
to his army and for its supplies. This led him to
organise regions over which communist authoritycould be established as rural ‘base areas’ wherethe peasantry were to be won over by redistribu-
tion of land. Mao’s revolutionary struggle thus
also belongs to the tradition of the great peasant
risings in China’s history.Mao’s capacity for organisation had alreadyshowed itself in 1929 when he analysed therequirements of these communist base areas; he
stressed the need for discipline, tight leadership
and a ruthless, single-minded sense of purpose.
The Chinese warlords were ruthless too, but theindiscipline and cruelty of their armies werewanton and indiscriminate. Mao’s goal was polit-
ical power, and the means to attain it was the Red
Army. But this army was not to conform to the1CHINA399
existing pattern of Chinese armies, to be encour-aged by prospects of rape and booty or driven toﬁght by fear of punishment. Mao explained, ‘The
Red Army must not merely ﬁght; besides ﬁght-
ing, it should also shoulder such important tasks
as agitating among the masses, organising them,and helping them to set up political power.’ Hisideal was an army recruited from volunteers, a
people’s army, whose task it should be to teach
and help the people of China in their daily tasks,
to gain their support and to motivate them to
communist victory. The Red Army was to be theinstrument of the party, not its master; its ulti-mate objective was to make possible the revolu-
tion along the lines determined by the party. The
army was to be a part of the masses, to be egali-

tarian and to win respect for its honesty and dis-cipline. Theory and reality usually part company.The ‘instrument of the party’ tended to obey
what the party’s leaders believed was for the good
of the people and not what people believed was
good for themselves. It would be used whenevernecessary to suppress popular discontent and tocarry out orders against other Chinese groups.Mao, just as Lenin did, saw that the funda-mental problem in all societies was the relation-
ship between the leadership and the mass of the
people. If the commands were given by a small,all-powerful party group, how were they to betransmitted to the masses without an inefﬁcient
and corrupt bureaucracy ﬁlling the gap between
the two? This was no mere theoretical problem.
During the anti-Japanese-War phase of Chinesecommunism from 1937 to 1945, communist baseareas had to be consolidated not only in Chiang’s
Chinese controlled territory but also behind
Japanese lines. The resources and production to
maintain and expand the communist-controlled
regions, which enabled the Red Army to carry onthe ﬁght against the Japanese, had to be devel-oped within these areas.Mao’s response during those years was tacticalflexibility, to which communist ideology, land
reform and egalitarianism had at this stage to besubordinated. The peasants’ aspirations had to betaken into account, the cooperation of the masses
won as far as possible by persuasion and by mater-
ial help. Mao’s slogan was ‘From the masses tothe masses’, and he developed a programme ofcontact with the masses that became known as the‘mass line’. Trained communists, well indoctri-
nated, were sent in groups into the communities,
where they said they had come to listen to the
desires and ideas of the people. On their return,the party would then learn what measures wouldparticularly appeal and would incorporate and
adapt them to their own policies, which would be
presented in turn to the people. The process was
intended to be continuous and became a power-
ful tool of propaganda. By 1945 the communistshad reached 100 million people and the mass linewas now carried to the people by more than 1
million party members. The maintenance of party
unity, the acceptance of common goals by the
communists scattered over the vast regions ofChina, however, was a constant problem, and themass line had to be matched by periodic attempts
to tighten discipline and intensive periods of
internal discussion and ‘self-examination’. Over
all this, Mao established in the 1940s his author-ity and leadership.A large proportion of the trained CommunistParty leadership did not come from poor peasant
or worker backgrounds. Once in their own
regions sympathies with relations and friends,
even with their own social class, affected the wayin which they accomplished their tasks. Thisbecame especially evident during the ﬁrst two

years after the communist takeover. A close study
made of early communist rule in Canton shows
that it took several years to bring under commu-nist control the vast areas of central and southernChina that had been militarily overwhelmed in a
short space of time. Many administrative tasks had
to be left still to Chiang’s Kuomintang to provide
the necessary expertise. The early transition from
Kuomintang to communist rule was accomplishedby example, by persuasion, and by terror as‘enemies’ were summarily executed.400THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55

From the first there were strong contrastsbetween the Russian and Chinese revolutions.While Marx, Lenin and Stalin provided models
and inspiration, the Chinese were determined to
develop a Chinese communism to suit the very
different circumstances and needs of theircountry. Mao adapted dogmatic communist ide-ology to his experience in the years before victory
in 1949. The leadership of Mao had been
accepted by 1935. He never forgot the lessons of
a decade earlier when the old Bolshevik leader-
ship sought to spread revolution by ﬁrst trying tocapture the cities. It was in the rural regions thatthe communists built up their bases from which
the cities and the rest of China were revolu-

tionised. Revolution in China was not to be
brought about within a short space of time, as ithad been in Russia; indeed it took two decadesto accomplish. The Chinese Revolution might
never have been carried forward to a successful
military conclusion but for the opportunities pro-
vided by the Japanese invasion of China. The bar-barity of the Japanese turned the Chinese againstthem. They sought protection from the Japanese
army’s killings, lootings and spoliation and found
it wherever the communists could establish their
authority. Mao’s call for resistance by all Chinese
classes to the Japanese invaders, coupled with theprogramme for rural reform, attracted masssupport. The composition of the Communist
Party in 1949 provides striking evidence of this:
just as the war aided the growth of communism,
so it revealed the corruption, incompetence andinefﬁciency of the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-chek’s leadership. The mistakes of the generals
and the generalissimo, a rank Chiang had accord-
ed to himself, were accompanied by hyperinﬂa-
tion, which destroyed the economy in the rear.
The arms supplied by the US were frequentlyturned against the Nationalist armies as the Red Army captured them or as whole sections of
the Nationalist forces deserted. The mass of the
Chinese people had lost all confidence in the
Kuomintang regime and longed for an end tofamine, death and the civil war.Mao’s triumph occurred in 1949. He now faced anentirely different problem – not only of organisinga revolution against the state’s authorities, but ofmanaging the vast Chinese continent with the rev-
olutionaries as the rulers. The greater part of China
had fallen into communist hands only during the
last months of the civil war, much more quickly
than he had anticipated. Unlike the old liberatedbase areas where communist rule had already func-
tioned for years, more than half of China had
recently been under Kuomintang control. There
were simply not enough trained communist per-

sonnel to take over the running of thousands of vil-

lages, towns and cities. Faced with the alternativesof total disruption or of a more gradualist approachto the transformation of China, Mao chose to take
time to win wide support.The ideology and tactics of Mao and a fewtrusted advisers would determine the fate of mil-lions of Chinese. But the Chinese people had wonno more rights. Mao thought in terms of history
and destiny, of the future of the quarter of
humanity that was Chinese, of the fate of the
world. In an almost godlike fashion he neverdoubted his mandate, and became impatient as hegrew older. The sacriﬁce of millions of Chinese
to promote the fulfilment of China’s destiny
counted for little in the scales of history as he saw
them. Justifying the means by the end took on
the most frightening aspects when applied to thelives of whole peoples by the twentieth-centuryideological messiahs; they were tyrannical and
ruthless in pursuit of their particular visions of a
better world. Mao was one of these.Mao was ready in the aftermath of military vic-
tory in 1949 to accept help from many quartersprovided it would assist China in achieving the two
main preliminary goals the communists had set:
freedom from foreign control and the ending of
‘feudalism’. Feudalism in this deﬁnition was a

broad concept; it encompassed exploitation by thelandlords and ‘capitalists’, so that in abolishing itChina would undergo an economic and social rev-

olution both in the countryside and in the cities.
Mao was supremely conﬁdent that China’s revolu-

tionary role was as signiﬁcant as Russia’s. Although
China’s revolution, like Russia’s, would be basedon the concepts of Marxism–Leninism, it was to
remain distinct. In the early years Mao acknow-

ledged Russia’s leadership of revolution in the1CHINA401
communist association of nations; but everynation, Mao believed, must remain the master ofits own destiny, completely sovereign and inde-

pendent. The corollary of this attitude was that
revolution could not be imposed externally – it had
to develop from within. Mao was at times ready toadapt policies opportunistically; at other times heimposed his own doctrinaire ideas. No particular
interpretation of Marxism would block the path he
wished to follow.Among the most urgent tasks of 1949 was towork out a new relationship with the Soviet com-
munist leaders. Mao could have had few illusionsabout Stalin or the Soviet Union. Stalin’s chief
concern appeared to be to avoid provoking the 
US to war, and in his conservative view, as in
Roosevelt’s and Truman’s, Asia took second placeto Europe in the East–West confrontation. Stalinfaced the task of reconstructing the Soviet Union,
of building up its strength sufﬁciently to deter the

capitalist West, of strengthening Soviet leverage in
Eastern and central Europe; meanwhile he wantedAsia to remain relatively quiet. ‘Reparations’ wereone obvious means of assisting the repair of
Russia’s devastated industries. As long as they
could be moved, machinery and whole factories
were transported to Russia from China. Half the
capital equipment the Japanese had accumulatedin Manchuria to develop industry there was carriedoff by the Russians with scant regard to China.
Stalin, moreover, had completely miscalculated
Chinese communist strength and had expected
Chiang Kai-shek to stay in power and to have thecapacity to crush the communists. Despite givinglimited help to the communists in northern China,
he had recognised Chiang Kai-shek and had allied
with the Nationalist Kuomintang, thus backing
the wrong horse. Mao therefore had little reason
for gratitude to Stalin or to the Soviet Union. TheChinese had made their own revolution, despitethe Russians. Nor did Mao regard a breach with
the US and the West as inevitable in 1949.
Indeed, a very significant portion of China’s
export trade continued with the West after thecommunist victory.Nevertheless, in 1949 Mao counted on receiv-
ing Soviet help and on a reorientation of Soviet
policy towards China. He wished to build upChina’s industrial potential, and China’s commu-
nists had little expertise in bringing about the nec-
essary changes in the urban economy and in urban
societies. The Soviet Union, which had faced this
task after 1917, could serve as a useful model. The
communist cadres, Mao told his party followers in1949, had to learn quickly the new task of admin-
istering cities. It was not out of love for Stalin or
acceptance of Soviet leadership that Mao pro-

claimed early in 1949 that there was no middle
way and that China must ‘lean’ to one side or the
other and so against ‘capitalist imperialism’. Chinawas weak. The US needed to be deterred frombacking Chiang’s cause further, indeed from pro-

tecting the Nationalist remnants on Taiwan. The
‘liberation’ of the island was a priority in 1949, to
complete the revolution territorially.But there was a further reason for leaning tothe Soviet Union. There was nowhere else the
Chinese communists could go. Mao regarded
himself as Marx’s and Lenin’s disciple and
regarded the Soviet Union as the ﬁrst successfulrevolutionary state. As he saw it, a broad ideo-logical division existed in the world and China
belonged to the Marxist–Socialist camp opposed
to the imperialist aggressive nations. He also
recognised the pre-eminent power of the Soviet
Union in the communist alliance of nations andbelieved that this power was essential to safeguardthe weaker socialist nations. What Mao would not
accept was that this gave the Soviet Union a right
to interfere with and dominate any of the smaller
communist states, or that each nation should notbe able to choose its own path of evolution basedon Marxist–Leninist teaching but suited to its
particular society and needs. There was thus, to
use Mao’s favourite tool of analysis, a ‘contradic-
tion’ in the Sino-Soviet relationship. China, the
weaker ally, needed the ﬁnancial, technical andmilitary support of the Soviet Union, so Chinawould openly identify itself with the communist
nations led by, by far, the most powerful of them.
But China rejected Moscow’s leadership in deter-
mining the course of its revolution. Mao’s ownstrong sense of national and ideological inde-pendence here asserted itself.After winning the civil war in China, Maoimmediately turned to the Soviet Union, jour-402THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
neying to Moscow in December 1949. He wasreceived by Stalin without much warmth. Afterall, not only was his victorious leadership in China
living proof of Stalin’s misjudgement, but Stalin
recognised in Mao a leader of enormous strength
of will and of an intellectual calibre approachinghis own self-estimate. Then there were the moreimmediate material concerns of Soviet interests in
China, which were now a problem. It had been
possible for Stalin, with American and British
backing, to impose Russia’s terms on Chiang Kai-
shek, who was trying to gain control of hiscountry and to defeat the communists. It wasgoing to be very much more difﬁcult to justify
these gains when face to face with a communist
ally who was determined to rid China of all
foreign ‘imperialist’ shackles. Two tough andruthless men faced each other in Moscow duringthe winter of 1949. Mao and his entourage
pursued their tasks with tenacity, remaining in the
Soviet capital for an unprecedented eight weeks
from December 1949 to February 1950.A new alliance treaty was eventually concludedon 14 February 1950. Agreement was reached on
the setting up of joint Sino-Soviet trading com-
panies, which would continue to give the Soviet
Union a special position in Manchuria, though it
was humiliating for Mao to concede this foreign‘colonial’ incursion. In the treaty text Mao alsohad to conﬁrm that China relinquished any claim
to Outer Mongolia. But he won some major revi-
sions of the 1945 alliance treaty Stalin had con-
cluded with Chiang Kai-shek; he reassertedChinese sovereignty over the Manchurian railways(the Chinese Eastern Railway), and Dairen and
Port Arthur were to be handed back to China not
later than 1952. Stalin promised to send techni-
cal advisers to assist the Chinese authorities espe-
cially in industrial and urban development, inwhich the Chinese communists lacked experience.He also promised ﬁnancial aid. A meagre Soviet
credit of the equivalent of US$300 million was
granted. Finally, and perhaps most importantly
from Mao’s point of view, the Soviet Union andChina bound themselves to a defensive alliance bywhich they agreed to come to each other’s aid in
the event of aggression by Japan or by any state
allied with it: this referred to the US, though itwas not mentioned. Years later Mao recalled howdifﬁcult a struggle it had been to persuade Stalinto sign the treaty, not least because the Soviet
leader wished to retain the option of mending
fences with the US; he had not wanted a victori-
ous communist revolution in China in the ﬁrstplace and now that it had succeeded he was afraidthat Mao might become another Tito in Asia. He
did all he could to ensure communist China’s
subservience to and dependence on the Soviet
Union through economic, military and ideologi-
cal ties, and until his death China played inter-nationally a secondary role – too weak and tooreliant on Soviet help to do otherwise.Mao, within China, followed his own course,and in his lifetime was to make several sudden
changes. The policy laid down in the spring of1949 by Mao and the Chinese Communist Partywas to secure broad popular support and a wide
coalition of political forces under the leadership of
the party, excluding only the Kuomintang. Mao
proclaimed this ideological line to suit the particu-
lar popular-front tactics he wished to follow as the‘People’s democratic dictatorship’. All depended
on Mao’s deﬁnition. Thus the ‘dictatorship’ was
designed to destroy the ‘enemies’ of the people,
while the ‘people’ included not only poor peasants
and the ‘middle’ peasants and workers, but alsoprofessional people, intellectuals, the propertied,merchants and those of limited wealth. The peas-

ants would continue to own their land – even the
better-off peasants were left in possession – and so
were the landlords of the land they themselvesfarmed. The Agrarian Reform Law, which cameinto effect in the summer of 1950, reﬂected this

moderation. The same gradualist approach in
1949 and 1950 can be seen in communist dealings
with industry. The thinking behind it was not a
belief in the merits of a mixed economy but ratherthe realisation that the production of the rich peas-
ants and of industry in private hands was essential
if the aims of socialism and the modernisation of
the country were to be realised. But the commu-

nist administration also continued to provide itselfwith the means to exercise increasing control overall production in the many regions of China.The early achievements of the takeover wereimpressive. There was far less disruption than1CHINA403
would have ensued if a purist communist socialrevolution had been decreed from the start. Thewhole vast country of some 540 million people
was paciﬁed and brought under a uniﬁed control.
The evil of rapid inflation was also mastered
during the ﬁrst two years of communist rule.China’s struggle to modernise had beendominated by the policies of the great European
nations, which had carved the country into
spheres of concessions, including ports which, like
Hong Kong, became colonies, or the scores of
‘treaty ports’ in which the foreigners enjoyedspecial rights. The impact of the foreigners hadprovided an impetus to modernisation in big
cities like Shanghai, in the construction of rail-
ways and in the growth of the Japanese-controlled
industry in Manchuria. But all this developmentwas designed to beneﬁt the foreigners rather thanthe Chinese.In 1949 Mao and the communist leadership setout to change the fabric of Chinese society and to
unite and strengthen the country. Modernisationas the West understood it – improving technol-ogy, increasing industrial and agricultural produc-
tion, spreading education and literacy, developing
communications, rejecting traditional philoso-
phies – was necessary not only to lift the popula-
tion from the trap of abject poverty and periodicfamine but to enable a Chinese nation to surviveat all. How else would it be possible to muster the
strength to eject the foreigner and prevent his
return on any but China’s terms? Yet Mao tried to
ﬁnd a way to proﬁt from Western culture withoutwholesale Westernisation, to assimilate it in anessentially Chinese way. The Soviet model couldbe followed, but like other Western models therewould be no slavish imitation or subjugation. Maowas determined to wipe out the humiliation of the
‘unequal treaties’ exploiting China’s resources
which had been imposed by the Western powers,
including Russia. For the time being Mao neededthe protection of the Soviet Union, especially ashe busied himself with expelling the Western ‘cap-
italists’. While it was true that tens of thousands of
Chinese had formed close ties with the West and
that the Western presence – in missionary, educa-
tional and medical ﬁelds – was also humanitarian,most Chinese hated the foreigner for assuming aposition of superiority in a land not his own. Many
Western residents had already left the mainland by
the time it fell under communist control. Those
who remained were to be rapidly expelled in thewake of the Korean War.The Korean War itself marked a watershed inthe development of communist internal policies in
China, in the relationships with Asia and in the tri-
angular power alignments of the Soviet Union,China and the US. The enormous impact of theKorean War was felt in Europe as well. The com-
munist and anti-communist confrontation was
seen in Washington, Moscow and London more
and more in interrelated global terms. Global
strategies were devised to meet the threat and theindependent forces shaping the future of Asiacame to be viewed by the nations of the First 
and Second Worlds, both communist and anti-
communist, through the distorting mirror of their
own ideological assumptions. One consequence ofenormous signiﬁcance for China was its isolationfrom the West.404THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
There are regions in the world where conﬂict isendemic. Between the latitudes of 35˚N and 40˚N
and 125˚SE and 130˚E a mountainous, heavily
forested peninsula extends southwards fromManchuria. Its lands border on China and Russiain the north and, across the Straits, with Japan in
the south. The people call their country ‘Choson’,
‘Land of the morning calm’. It expresses their
longing rather than reality, for Korea’s strategic
importance and potential wealth have attractedcovetous neighbours since the second century BC.Korea became the pathway along whichChinese culture reached Japan, which in turn
invaded Korea. The Korean peoples were usually
too weak and divided to resist more powerfulneighbours. But in the struggles ancient and mod-ern against foreign invaders a sense of Korean
identity was formed, as was pride in a Korean cul-
ture and tradition. Since ancient times too the fate
of the Korean peoples was dependent on the
development of their neighbours in Asia. Theircountry was repeatedly invaded, rent by factionalstruggles and its people oppressed. Paradoxically,
for much of the nineteenth century the Koreans
successfully resisted half-hearted Western attempts
to open the country and were able to maintaintheir isolation. It was the Japanese once again whoforced Korea to yield in the last quarter of the
nineteenth century. But the Chinese too wished
to reassert their ancient rights.In modern times three wars of global signiﬁ-cance were fought for control of Korea. The ﬁrst,between China and Japan in 1894–5, ended in aJapanese victory. With the close of the nineteenth
century Russia became a new contender for
Korea. The second war was therefore betweenJapan and Russia; once more, in 1905, Japan wasvictorious, and for the next forty years it occupied
and ruled Korea. But despite Japan’s repression a
strong movement for Korean independence
developed. Both wars over Korea, especially the
Russo-Japanese war and its outcome, had world-wide repercussions. Checked in Korea, tsaristRussia turned its attention back to the West, with
the result that its concerns in the Balkans were to
contribute to the outbreak of the First World War
in Europe. Korean independence remained adream. But that dream at last looked realisable topolitically minded Koreans in 1945 with the
defeat of Japan. The Allies had promised at the
Cairo Conference in 1943 that a uniﬁed, free and
independent Korea would be established. But a
period of trusteeship was envisaged. With Russia’sentry into the war against Japan on 8 August1945, an old contender for inﬂuence in Korea
came back on the scene.The suddenness of Japan’s surrender left a largeJapanese army still in effective occupation. TheRussians were closest and were able to enter Koreafrom the north on 12 August. American troops
could not be brought there for another three
weeks. Working with Korean communist and
nationalist resistance movements, the Soviets, whohad promised to respect Korean independence.1Chapter 361950CRISIS IN ASIA – WAR IN KOREA
Their ostensible task was merely to disarm theJapanese and occupy the country north of the38th parallel. Under Soviet auspices the Korean
People’s Republic was proclaimed on 6 September
1945. To avoid a power vacuum in the south,
meanwhile, the US ordered the Japanese militarycommand to maintain authority until US forcesarrived, which they did on 8 September. The
Americans were in fact doing exactly what 
the British had done in French Indo-China. The
Korean People’s Republic was opposed by the
exiled Korean provisional government, which hadbeen supported by the US and by KuomintangChina. With the Russians north of the 38th paral-
lel and the Americans to the south, the partition
was supposed to be temporary. The stark fact was
that the Korean people north and south were notto be given the complete democratic choice overthe future of their country that they had been
promised. More than half a century later Korea
remains divided still.There were parallels with occupied and dividedGermany. In both Korea and Germany the militaryzonal frontiers became the frontiers of separate
states. In both Germany and Korea, the Russians
hoped that by building up a strong communist
embryonic government they could attract the
larger population in the rest of the country by pur-
suing popular-front tactics with the left dominat-
ing. The Americans in Korea were also following
popular-front tactics, so to speak in reverse, in try-

ing to bring together a coalition of the right, the
moderates and the left under right-wing predom-
inance. This coalition General John Hodge, thecommanding US general in South Korea, hoped
would attract the moderates of the North. The
Soviet andAmerican strategies therefore involvedbuilding a sound pro-Soviet or pro-Western polit-

ical base in each of their zones prior to unifyingKorea, which could then be expected to conformto their views. The Koreans, in the more populous
South, proved not to be so amenable.In the American-occupied South the rightistDr Syngman Rhee emerged as the dominantKorean politician. He was not only violently anti-communist but also an ardent nationalist deter-
mined on the reality of an independent uniﬁed
Korea. A tough and formidable leader, he hadspent most of his adult life from 1912 to 1945 inexile in the US championing Korean independ-ence. Now with Japan defeated, Rhee was in a
hurry to get the Russians and the Americans out
of his country and to defeat, if necessary by force,
the communists in the North. He was suspiciousof the bargaining of the Russians and theAmericans over the future of Korea. Despite their
concern over Rhee’s extremism the Americans
could not do without him since he clearly domin-
ated the weaker moderate and left political group-
ings in the South.In North Korea Russian aid between 1945 and1950 built up a militarily powerful state which the
military weaker South could not hope to overrun.
Strong guerrilla activity might then destabilise
South Korea, and the partitioned country wouldbe plunged into civil war, which the better pre-pared North would be expected to win. But Stalin
took care to avoid any overt direct Russian
involvement. Kim Il Sung, the autocratic, inde-
pendent communist leader, was imposing his ownbrand of Marxist society on the Korean people;his thoughts were to have equal validity with
those of Mao and Lenin. He was no mere puppet.
Having built up the North the Russians withdrew
in December 1948, leaving behind military advis-
ers. This placed increasing pressure on theAmericans to leave the South.The Americans were eager enough to with-draw. The South had become a bed of nettles.
But how to extricate themselves? When the US
military advisers looked at the strategic situationthey concluded that South Korea was not a suit-able base for the defence of Western Paciﬁc inter-
ests. Japan and the Paciﬁc islands, including the
Philippines, formed the best defensive arc. A
divided Korea, with the south looking to the
West, was a perfectly acceptable solution. Butthere was the commitment to a uniﬁed Korea.The Russians and Chinese were willing to see a
uniﬁed communist Korea come into being, the
Americans a uniﬁed pro-Western, anti-communist
Korea. No wonder the Russians and Americanscould never agree at their joint meetings astrustees. Completely free elections throughout
Korea would have put the communists into a
minority, especially with the rightist South406THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
Koreans rigging the elections. So the Russiansresisted that. Meanwhile in the part of thecountry under its control the American military
government was being assailed on all sides to
hand over to South Korean politicians. The
Americans, at a time when they were champi-oning the free world against communism, foundthe authoritarian Rhee an embarrassing ally.This intractable problem was handed to theUnited Nations at the end of 1947. The UN was
Western-dominated, so this involved no complete
abandonment of South Korea. The UN was sup-posed to organise elections throughout Koreapreparatory to unifying the country, but this was
obviously a pipe dream. No elections could be
held in 1948 in the North, and in the South they
were sufﬁciently corrupt with thousands of arreststo raise doubts whether the UN could accept theelection as valid. The UN nevertheless did so and
Syngman Rhee became the ﬁrst president of the
Republic of Korea, claiming to speak for all
Korea. He was promptly recognised by the West. In June 1949 the Americans followed theRussians in pulling their troops out. In the North,
the Democratic People’s Republic under Kim Il
Sung was recognised by China, the Soviet Union
and the communist satellites. With the Russians
and Americans no longer in direct control, civilwar had come a step closer. The sparring, mainlyverbal, continued until the summer of 1950.Between 1948 and 1950 the East–Westbalance in Asia was radically altered. Communism
in various national forms was spreading fast overthe mainland. At the same time from 1948 to1949 in Germany the US and Britain were facing
down the Russians over Berlin. The Russians and
Americans each exercised sufﬁcient restraint to

avoid escalation into war. Similar restraint was
shown by the Americans, the Russians and theChinese during the climax of the crisis in Asiafrom 1949 to 1950. Attention had focused on
China before June 1950 rather than on Korea.
American efforts on the Asian mainland had been
limited, ambiguous and largely unsuccessful.Chiang Kai-shek had collapsed with his corruptregime in China and the Americans had refused
to make an all-out effort to save him; US help to
the French in Indo-China had also been limited.American troops were not engaged in ﬁghtinganywhere, and it was to be hoped that the with-drawal of the Russians and Americans had reduced
East–West tensions on the Asian mainland too.The Truman administration had to decide early in1950 what constituted the free world in Asia, howit could be defended and how, above all, any mis-

understanding had to be avoided that could turn
the Cold War into a ‘hot war’. The communists in
China and the Soviet Union had to learn which
vital Western interests the Americans would defendwith their military might. An era of post-waruncertainty would then be ended. For both the
Russians and the Americans the priority was
Europe, where no further alterations in spheres of
power and interest would be tolerated: there thefrontiers were ﬁrmly set. Asia was too vast for
America or Russia to control. The transformation
from empire to independence, the rapid changes
taking place in many societies and internal conﬂicts

were all creating uncertainties about the future in amanner that was bad news for the West, which wasidentiﬁed with imperialism. In this respect, the
West was at a disadvantage in the face of the ‘lib-

erating’ claims of the various communist and
socialist movements. The future of much of south-
east Asia still seemed to hang in the balance,American resources were not limitless, andWestern Europe was still in a perilous condition.
At least the Americans controlled the prize of
Japan. The Truman administration’s military advis-

ers were reasonably consistent from 1947 to thesummer of 1950: in eastern Asia the line of defencethat could be, and would have to be, defended lay
in the Paciﬁc short of the Asian mainland.Truman, more concerned with Europe, ac-cepted their advice. But on one signiﬁcant point
he adopted the views of Secretary of State Dean Acheson rather than those of the chiefs of staff. Acheson thought that the Chinese commu-
nists could be encouraged to follow a line inde-
pendent of Moscow’s. They should therefore be
conciliated now that Mao had proclaimed theChinese People’s Republic in October 1949. Thesore point was the island of Taiwan (Formosa), to
which Chiang Kai-shek had withdrawn with close
on half a million still loyal troops. Although Mao11950: CRISIS IN ASIA – WAR IN KOREA407
claimed Taiwan as part of China, the US contin-ued to give aid to Chiang Kai-shek, though noAmerican combat units were sent to support him.
In a conciliatory speech on 5 January 1950
Truman publicly declared that the US would 
not intervene in the Chinese Civil War and thatTaiwan was Chinese. If Mao had been strongenough to invade the island, the Americans would
not have prevented it, but they knew that he was
not. To emphasise that the US was not about to
embark on an appeasement policy, Dean Acheson
delivered an important and trenchant speech aweek later on 12 January, intended both forMoscow’s ears and for public opinion at home.
The US would defend its vital interests in the
Paciﬁc, its essential line of defence running from
the Aleutians to Japan, to the Ryukus and thePhilippines; mainland China, Acheson pointedout, had been lost by Chiang’s defeat, not by the
Americans themselves, who could have done
nothing to prevent Mao’s victory.It was notable that South Korea and Taiwanwere both omitted from Dean Acheson’s state-ment. The assumptions behind his and Truman’s
policies in 1949 and early 1950 were half right
and half wrong. The view that the Chinese com-
munists had national interests not identical with
Russia’s and should not be driven into Russia’sarms was a sophisticated perception that was soonlost, not to be revived until the Nixon–Kissinger
initiatives three decades later. Wrong was the
belief that the speeches would bring about a
reduction of tension. US support for the Kuom-intang on Taiwan was too obvious for Mao notto be indignant that America was protecting his
arch-enemy. The non-recognition of communist
China by the US also denied to the People’s
Republic its rightful seat on the UN Security
Council. To add insult to injury, the rumpChinese government in Taiwan continued as per-manent member of the Security Council until
1971, with all the power accorded to this status.In the US the signature of the Chinese–SovietFriendship treaty in February 1950 seemed toprove that Acheson was wrong, and pressureagainst the Truman administration, which was
accused of having ‘lost’ China, overcame attempts
to formulate more subtle policies. The decisiveshift in America’s Red China policy occurred on25 June 1950, the day the North Koreanslaunched their invasion. In response to aggression
by ‘the communists’, the Chinese being included
in the general global conspiracy, Truman ordered
the US Seventh Fleet to the Formosan Straits toprevent a communist Chinese invasion of Taiwan.In a show of ostensible even-handedness Truman
declared that the US ﬂeet would also prevent any
attempt by Chiang (highly improbable) to invade
the mainland again. In contravention of his earlier
pronouncement, Truman had now intervened inthe Chinese Civil War. Communist Chinese andAmericans were to remain frozen in mutual hos-
tility. There were no further US attempts to nor-
malise relations with the new China, and the
communist Chinese for their part now regardedthe US as their principal enemy. The formationof NATO, in 1949, though conﬁned to Europe,
led them to conclude that this Western alliance
signiﬁed the coming of a global struggle between
communism and imperialism.It is against this background of the developingCold War that the reactions of both the US and
China to the North Korean attack on South
Korea on 25 June 1950 become intelligible.
Acheson’s omission of South Korea as vital to thedefence of the US encouraged Kim Il Sung. Kim’sinvasion of the South was approved in Moscow,
but Stalin had no intention of risking a war with
the US. His support was secret; Soviet ofﬁcers
assisted in the military planning of the aggression,thinly disguised as a defensive counter to analleged attack from the south. Though Beijing
knew of Kim’s ambitions, the Chinese were not
in on the ﬁnal plans. They came as a total surprise
to Washington, whose intelligence services had
failed to provide any warning. The reaction of theTruman administration was nonetheless swift anddecisive. Because of the world time difference, the
news of the North Korean invasion reached
Washington at 10 p.m. on the evening of
Saturday, 24 June. The president had just ﬁnisheda quiet family dinner hundreds of miles away athis home in Independence, Missouri, where he
had gone for the weekend. There he received
Acheson’s urgent telephone call telling him about408THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
the invasion. The following day the presidentreturned to Washington.The earlier American policy of involving theUnited Nations in the search for a solution to
Korean problems now provided the Truman
administration with a card to play. The US wouldnot need to react alone to safeguard its Asianinterests but could do so in the name of the UN
Charter and at the request of the Security
Council. This would have been impossible but for
one fortuitous circumstance. A country’s mem-
bership of the UN requires a two-thirds approvalby the General Assembly on a Security Councilrecommendation, with a power of veto exercis-
able by any of the ﬁve permanent members. When
communist China was not allowed to replace
Chiang Kai-shek’s regime on the SecurityCouncil, the Russians refused to attend theSecurity Council meetings. This proved a huge
tactical blunder. Had the Soviet Union been
present and cast its veto, or had Mao’s govern-
ment been represented on the Security Council,the Security Council would have vetoed militaryaction. The Soviet Union had thrown away the
very safeguard – the veto – it had fought so hard
to secure when the UN was founded.Dean Acheson rapidly masterminded America’sdiplomatic reaction. The Security Council met onSunday, 25 June and called on North Korea tohalt the invasion and to pull back its forces to the
38th parallel. Truman independently authorised
the use of the US air force in Korea south of the
parallel to evacuate 2,000 Americans, and GeneralMacArthur was placed in command of operationsin Korea. Truman also ordered equipment and
arms to be sent from US bases in the Paciﬁc to
help the South Korean army. These unilateral
American decisions anticipated a second, tougher
resolution of the Security Council adopted on thenight of Tuesday, 27 June and drafted by the USambassador to the UN. This called on members
‘to render such assistance to the Republic of Korea
as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and
to restore international peace and security to thearea’.The ﬁrst week of the Korean War broughtanother reversal of US policy. The headlong 
flight of the South Korean army made it essentialto send reinforcements if they were to be savedfrom total defeat. Chiang Kai-shek’s offer of soldiers was rejected but in his capacity as US 
commander-in-chief Truman ordered American
ground troops to move into Korea. Militarily, the
US was unprepared, because Truman’s ‘economybudget’ had slashed defence spending to thebone. Although the National Security Council in
Washington had earlier that year drawn up plans
for a massive increase of defence spending and 
a rapid expansion of the armed forces, they 
had not yet been acted on. Truman, neverthelessannounced during the ﬁrst days of the KoreanWar that, to meet the threat of Asia, the US
would defend Korea and Taiwan and help the
Philippine government and the French in their
anti-communist campaigns. This was contrary toearlier strategic planning: on the assumption thatMoscow was following a global strategy, US
strategists had come up with the concept of
regions of prime importance to be defended and
those of less importance. Defence would not bediverted from prime regions by Moscow’sattempts to distract the US from its goals. This
strategic thinking was overridden by Truman in
the summer of 1950.For Truman and Acheson the engagement inKorea was motivated by the premise that com-munists must not be permitted to expand andoverthrow independent nations anywhere. If not
checked when they struck, wherever that might
be, even in strategically less important Korea,
then what faith would the allies in Europe havein America’s readiness to resist aggression? ForMacArthur, on the other hand, Asia came ﬁrst –
and now the hot war was actually being fought
in Asia. As he saw it, the military objective was 
to defeat the enemy and to do so by any means
necessary; this might even include the use ofnuclear weapons and, if China joined the war, thebombing of the Chinese Manchurian sanctuaries
beyond the frontiers of North Korea.The views of Truman’s advisers on the politicalobjectives to be achieved and the military meansthat could be used were different from Mac-Arthur’s from the beginning of the Korean War.
Neither MacArthur nor Truman wished to pro-

voke a Soviet or communist Chinese entry into 11950: CRISIS IN ASIA – WAR IN KOREA409
the war. MacArthur, who saw himself uniquelyable to interpret the oriental mind, did not believethat the Chinese would risk war against a victori-

ous US army; a tough policy, he counselled, would
be much more likely to deter them than attempts
at appeasement. Truman, who was not so sure,vacillated, trying on the one hand to reassure com-
munist China and on the other sanctioning a pol-

icy of crushing the North Koreans. But these
differences between the commander in the ﬁeld

and Washington did not present an unbridgeable
gulf until, in military adversity, MacArthur’s con-
duct posed a challenge to the president’s authority.As long as MacArthur was turning defeat into vic-

tory he had the backing of the country and the
administration, even while there were nagging
doubts in Washington that his mercurial tempera-
ment and self-esteem might expand US policybeyond the aim of restoring peace in Korea.In Washington the concept of a ‘limited war’was developed and ﬁrst applied in Korea. The
conﬂict was deliberately limited in two ways. Itwas fought as a localised war geographically: theTruman administration would not extend it to
China, even when Chinese ‘volunteers’ poured
into Korea, nor would it take the risk of a Soviet
entry and ensuing global war. It was also limitedin that it was fought with conventional weapons:the use of nuclear arms was ruled out.The reasons for Truman’s decision to limit thewar in Korea, a vital decision rightly taken, were
neither understood nor approved by General
MacArthur. He saw it as his duty to safeguard thelives of the men under his command and to ﬁghtfor a complete and not a partial victory – yet the
White House would not allow him to take up
Chiang’s offer of troops. MacArthur was also
instructed that it was not part of UN aims to assist
the Chinese Nationalists to retake the mainlandof China. His immediate task was to stop thecomplete rout of the South Korean army. He bril-
liantly stabilised a short front in July and August
1950, covering the bridgehead of Pusan, a mere
Korean toehold. The North Koreans had hesi-tated and missed the opportunity to occupy thewhole of Korea.With the best of North Korean troops concen-trated on the tip of the Korean peninsula prepar-
ing to drive the growing American reinforcementsinto the sea, MacArthur executed one of the mostaudacious and successful counterstrokes in mili-
tary history. In mid-September, he conducted an410THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55

end to the war. © National Archives, Washingtonamphibious operation on the Korean west coast atInchon, landing American troops with naval andair support far to the north of the Koreans ﬁght-
ing in the south, so cutting their supply lines. The
North Korean army, in total disarray, was thrown
into headlong retreat. For the American public itwas a spectacular turnaround in the fortunes ofwar and conﬁrmed the military genius of the 71-
year-old ﬁve-star general. MacArthur, never shy 
of self-praise, himself described the Inchon land-
ing as a ‘classic’. Unfortunately for the Americans
and the Western cause it was not to be the lastturning point of the war.Rapidly advancing to the north, MacArthurreached the 38th parallel. From a small bridge-

head, military control over the whole of South
Korea had been wrested from the communists injust two weeks. The North Korean armies wereincapable any longer of putting up effective resis-

tance. On reaching the parallel MacArthur paused.
Instead of ending the Korean War swiftly, the
South Koreans, the Americans and their allies wereto suffer another defeat, heavy casualties andalmost three more years of war. This was solely the
result of China’s decision to devote substantial
forces to the protection of North Korea. Historians
have been inclined to blame MacArthur’s insubor-

dination in ignoring an important aspect of his mil-
itary orders from Washington, not to push UStroops close to the borders of China and the Soviet
Union, but to use only South Korean troops in
such operations. MacArthur regarded this as mili-

tarily impractical, so two American armies, facinglittle resistance, pushed north-west and north-eastto the Manchurian frontier on the Yalu River and
towards the Soviet frontier. First contact was made
with Chinese troops towards the end of October;
then the Chinese disappeared, and in a brilliant
manoeuvre their commander Peng Dehuai struckat the advanced American divisions on Monday, 27November (local date). The American troops
reeled back and were extricated from the North
only with the greatest difﬁculty. Seoul was soon

lost again. In December General Ridgway tookimmediate command of the front line underMacArthur and in January 1951 stabilised a new
front line some eighty miles south of the 38th
parallel.The blame for Chinese intervention needs tobe attributed as much to a divided administrationin Washington as to MacArthur. The Yalu was a
sensitive border, all the more so because a great
dam and hydroelectric installation there supplied
electricity both to Manchuria and to NorthKorea. MacArthur had been instructed to with-draw from contact if there were signs of Chinese
or Soviet intervention in the north and to refer
back for instructions to Washington. He had been
ordered not to use US combat troops close to the
borders. But he had also received clear instruc-tions to cross the 38th parallel, so he began hisadvance on 7 October 1950. He was allowed
much discretion, itself an indication of military
irresolution in Washington and of the political
weakness of Truman, who was under much pres-sure at home. He was reluctant to controlMacArthur closely in the general’s hour of
victory. MacArthur’s success would also convinc-
ingly answer the president’s critics at home who
were claiming that the administration did nothave the necessary determination to roll backcommunism in the world. The possibility of
Chinese intervention was discounted despite clear
signs to the contrary. Stalin’s refusal to become
involved was seen as far more important. The
ﬁghting capacities of the Chinese communists,regarded as mere Asiatics, were underestimated,and the readiness of the communist leaders to
accept huge casualties was not anticipated.
MacArthur did not believe they had a chance
against the best-trained and best-equipped armyin the world. Early newspaper reports, too, gavethe impression that the Chinese offensive was
being conducted by vast hordes of ill-disciplined
primitives sounding their trumpets and striking
cymbals. There was more than a touch of racial
arrogance about all this. The Chinese victories,gained at heavy cost in lives and forcing the haz-ardous retreat of the US divisions, came as a
shock to the Western world.China’s leaders had only reluctantly becomeembroiled in a war with the most powerfulWestern nation. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlaisought a compromise: South Korean, not Ameri-
can, troops could cross the 38th parallel. The
Soviet Union meanwhile threw out feelers for 11950: CRISIS IN ASIA – WAR IN KOREA411
a negotiated settlement and the withdrawal ofoutside forces from Korea. In Washington this wasinterpreted as an attempt to save North Korea
from total military defeat, without which there
could be no permanent peace in Korea. Truman,
after earlier virulent accusations that his adminis-tration had been soft on communism and had notprovided sufﬁcient support to Chiang Kai-shek,
found it politically difﬁcult to resist MacArthur’s
wish to pursue a beaten communist enemy.The day after US troops crossed the 38th par-allel, Mao gave the order for Chinese interven-tion, thinly disguised as the action of Chinese‘volunteers’ to maintain North Korea as a buffer.
Stalin would not risk a war with the US, but
urged Mao to save Kim; first promising his
support, then reneging, Mao had to intervenealone. Later that year Stalin did help, sending mil-itary units and weapons to protect China and ‘vol-
unteer’ pilots to North Korea. The invasion of
Taiwan had to be postponed and the reconstruc-
tion of China itself was delayed by the need todeploy resources for the war. For China, theKorean War, coming so soon after the civil war,
was a setback, but its success in retaking most of
North Korea, in following a policy independent
of Moscow’s and in holding a front against the
American and UN troops raised its internationalprestige. The Korean War made it clear to theworld that China was now, along with the US and
the Soviet Union, a power to be reckoned with
in Asia.During the winter of 1950–1 the Truman admin-istration had to take critical decisions. American
prestige was suffering in inverse proportion to
China’s success. Truman now faced criticism from
two opposite camps. There were those who
blamed the administration for crossing the 38thparallel. And there was a vociferous minority, con-stantly encouraged by MacArthur himself, who
called for a widening of the war and the defeat of
China, at least in Korea. MacArthur sent back
gloomy military reports to the effect that, unlessthe US was prepared to give up ﬁghting a limitedwar and was ready to bomb the Chinese sanctu-
aries in Manchuria, a total withdrawal from Korea
would become necessary. Among the plansMacArthur advocated was to sow a ‘defensiveﬁeld of radioactive waste’ across the supply linesleading to northern Korea. The military successes
achieved by General Ridgway in pushing the
North Koreans back across the 38th parallel did
nothing to modify MacArthur’s public criticismsof Truman’s military and foreign policy of search-ing for a settlement with China. Despite repeated
warnings, MacArthur continued his efforts to
force a change of policy on the administration.
The ﬁnal straw was a letter MacArthur sent to a
leading Republican congressman, which wasreleased to undermine Truman’s policies and inwhich MacArthur gave his backing to the use of
Chiang’s troops. The war in Korea, MacArthur
wrote, had to be won: ‘if we lose the war to
Communism in Asia the fall of Europe isinevitable, win it and Europe most probablywould avoid war and yet preserve freedom’.
MacArthur regarded himself as above politics, as
a wise guide to the free world in pointing to 
the dangers of the communist global conspiracy;he could not accept the change of policy inWashington, which expressed a readiness to end
the war short of total victory by negotiating a
compromise settlement with the aggressor. His
enormous prestige and half a century of service,
MacArthur had convinced himself, made himuntouchable, beyond Washington’s power tolimit his freedom to speak his mind.Truman, embattled at home, had no illusionsabout the storm that would break out if he dis-
missed MacArthur, nor about the use hisRepublican opponents on Capitol Hill wouldmake of the differences between the civilian 
president and the great general on the issue of
how to conduct a war. For Truman the question
had become a different one. Who was to control
policy, the president or the general? OnceTruman had made up his mind, he did not lackthe courage to see things through. There could
be no doubt that he would defend the presidency.
In April 1951 he dismissed MacArthur with the
concurrence of the chiefs of staff and in a radiobroadcast explained to the American people thatthe US objectives in Korea were limited. In the
short term, Truman’s standing suffered. A Gallup
poll showed that his popularity had dropped to412THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55
an unprecedented low of 24 per cent. But itrecovered. Reﬂection led to reappraisal, to a lessemotional response and to the recognition of the
dangers of getting into an all-out war with China.
The Korean War, to be sure, was frustrating, as 
it dragged on with heavy casualties. Outrightvictory was preferred, of course, but not at theprice of risking an even bigger war with still
heavier casualties for a country few Americans
took much interest in.To conduct a limited war was the crucial deci-sion the Truman administration had taken fromthe start. To stick to that decision in the face ofa loss of American prestige in the winter of
1950–1 required courage and wisdom. There
would be no extension of the Korean War.
Perhaps Truman deserved better than haveBeijing reject out of hand all attempts to settleKorea by negotiation at the UN. The chance of
bringing the Korean War to an end was not all
that was lost. Mao’s radical turn in China pre-
vented a new start being made in Sino-Americanrelations with communist China taking its seat inthe Security Council. Truman’s decision to
defend Taiwan set the US on a course that
opened an unbridgeable gulf in its relations with
China for many years.In the US the Korean War had a major impact.Truman had sounded the alarm about the world-
wide danger of communism since the early days of
the administration. The Truman Doctrine, the
Marshall Plan, support for West Berlin and NATOhad all won the support of the majority ofCongress and of the American people. But a new
‘red scare’ got out of hand. The revelation that a
British atomic scientist, Klaus Fuchs, had passed
secrets to the Russians, added to the setting off of
the ﬁrst Soviet atomic bomb in August 1949, hadraised fears about the dangers of communist inter-nal subversion and had created an atmosphere
bordering on hysteria. Congressional investiga-

tions into subversion by the House Committee on
Un-American Activities had been on the increasesince 1945. The sensational trials involving AlgerHiss, a State Department ofﬁcial, and Whittaker
Chambers, who worked for Timemagazine,increased American apprehensions about the redconspiracy to new heights and divided Americansociety. Chambers, a former member of theCommunist Party, accused Hiss, codenamed
‘Ales’ by his Soviet spymasters, of having engaged
in espionage. Hiss denied the accusations but was
convicted in January 1950, after a second trial, forperjury. The way was open now to link the ‘loss ofChina’ with the ‘treacherous’ activities of key
State Department personnel and their active advis-
ers. A quiet professor, Owen Lattimore, an expert
on Outer Mongolia, was suddenly thrust into the
limelight as a key ﬁgure in the ‘conspiracy’. Ayoung Republican senator from Wisconsin,Joseph McCarthy, grasped the opportunity to
bring himself to national attention by making sen-
sational and unsubstantiated accusations about
communist inﬁltration of the US government,particularly the State Department. Dean Acheson,who refused to repudiate Hiss, was among the tar-
gets, but Truman stood up for him. Well-known
actors and directors from Hollywood, trade
unionists, teachers and many others were broughtbefore the committee for questioning. Guilt byassociation was sufﬁcient. Regarded as bad risks,
their chances of employment were blighted for
years. Immigration was tightened to exclude
alleged subversives.There was no McCarthy, fortunately, in Britain,where the excesses of the senator were causingpublic concern about the lack of balance being
shown by the country’s principal ally. While
McCarthy could uncover no spies in the State
Department, apart from Hiss, there actually werethree in the Foreign Office, two of them inWashington at that time transmitting information
to Moscow via London. Kim Philby was first 
secretary of the British Embassy in Washington;
the second secretary was Guy Burgess; and the
American Department at the Foreign Ofﬁce in
London was headed by another spy, DonaldMaclean. Philby tipped off Burgess and Maclean
that the Security Service, MI5, was on their trail
and they defected in May 1951. Philby maintained
his cover until 1963 before he also escaped toMoscow. How much harm they did has remaineda secret. In the depression years of the 1930s, and
while the communists could claim in Spain and
elsewhere that they were leading the ﬁght against
11950: CRISIS IN ASIA – WAR IN KOREA413
fascism, the Communist Party attracted many,including intellectuals, who were idealists andwanted to create a better world. Newspapers and
books were at that time revealing the concentra-

tion camps and brutalities of Nazi Germany. The
horrors of Stalin’s Russia, the chain of forcedlabour camps, the Gulag, were carefully hiddenfrom view. The Soviet Union was shut off from the
West – unlike Nazi Germany – and a few naive vis-

itors, including the Dean of Canterbury, were
shown only the country’s happy face and then
returned to the West to write ecstatic accounts ofwhat they had seen. The admiration for the RedArmy and the Soviet people, ofﬁcially blessed by

Allied propaganda during the Second World War,
persuaded others into temporary support of com-

munism.For most of these Western communists, disil-lusionment set in steadily after 1945 with the
growing evidence of the Soviet suppression of
freedom in Eastern and central Europe. By the
time of the crushing of the Hungarian rising in1956 no illusions could remain. Many commu-nists of the 1930s had left the party by then; sub-
stantial numbers had fallen for the propaganda of
one of the communist front organisations only
when young, in their student days. There were
indeed thousands, and some had entered govern-ment service. McCarthy thus could build up fearson a basis of fact. But these men and women were
not automatically disloyal to their country or sub-
servient to foreign masters. The few who were fre-
quently served Moscow for gain or out of twistedpsychological motives. There will always be spiesand traitors as long as nations are locked in hostile
confrontation. The evil result of McCarthyism
was to smear everyone with the same broad
brush, whether there was good, ﬂimsy or no evi-
dence. The senator appealed to low instincts ofenvy, of dislike for the intellectual establishment,and so struck a chord of meanness and worse. Anatmosphere of fear began to prevail, which erodedcivil liberties.Truman condemned McCarthy in forthrightlanguage. McCarthy, after MacArthur’s dismissal,
even called for Truman’s impeachment; he nextattacked General George Marshall, arguablyAmerica’s architect of military victory during the
Second World War and later Truman’s secretary 
of state, as part of ‘a conspiracy so immense, an
infamy so black, as to dwarf any in the history of
man’. The Truman administration tried to meetpublic worries aroused by McCarthyism aboutcommunism by introducing loyalty checks on
public employees. In the Senate opposition to
McCarthy diminished as his power grew. It
reached its zenith in 1954 during the Eisenhoweradministration. McCarthyism represented theexaggerated reaction of all those who hated the
New Deal, Truman’s Fair Deal and civil rights 
legislation. They believed that America was suc-
cumbing to creeping socialism and creating an all-embracing federal state hostile to the sturdyindividualism on which (as they saw it) America
had grown to prosperity and power. McCarthyism
also provided an outlet for the frustration pro-
voked by the realisation that the world could not
be shaped in the image of the US. Communismhad made enormous advances and was a potentforce for change: the US had failed to halt its
progress and had, in the McCarthyites’ view, ‘lost
China’. They railed against the limitations of
America’s global policies and claimed that the lim-itations were self-imposed, because the policiesthemselves had been inspired from within by com-
munists. Setting aside the evils of the McCarthyite
smear tactics, what many Americans found hard to
accept was that the Second World War had not
settled global problems, had not proved to be thewar that ends all war.414THE TRANSFORMATION OF ASIA, 1945–55

THE ENDING OF EUROPEANDOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLEEAST, 1919–80
The Middle East is ridden with strife thinlypapered over. Arab nation is divided from Arabnation, fundamentalist Muslims from moderateMuslims who accept the secular state, Persians
(Iranians) from Arabs, feudal tribal monarchies
from secular republics, the oil-rich from the poornations. Why is there so much conﬂict? Is thereone root cause? If the Zionists had not created
Israel, would there have been peace? Were the
Arabs set against each other by outside powers,by the Russians, by the British, by the Americans?Or do the problems of the region derive from a
backlash against the imposition of alien Western
traditions on a traditional Islamic society? Is theconﬂict of terror waged in the twenty-ﬁrst centuryby extreme Muslim groups in the Middle East
and the West, a so-called ‘clash of civilisations’?
How artiﬁcial are the national frontiers, the result
of great-power bargains imposed on the regionafter the First World War? Central to the Middle East’s geopoliticalimportance is its oil, a commodity vital since 1945
to the prosperity of the oil states, the West andJapan. Before the Second World War MiddleEastern oil was less signiﬁcant: the US, Mexico
and Venezuela were the major oil exporters,
Venezuelan oil production alone in 1939 exceed-ing that of the entire Middle East. But during the war, Iraqi oil became vital to Britain, which
occupied the country jointly with the Soviet
Union. It was the dramatic expansion of oil con-sumption after the Second World War, the indus-trial changeover from coal to oil and theexpansion of motor and air travel that gave theMiddle Eastern oil-producing nations so import-ant a role in Western economies. The US thenceased to be an exporter of oil and became an
importer.Between 1919 and 1939 the US, Britain andthe Netherlands had secured a virtual monopoly ofMiddle Eastern oil concessions and so came to
dominate world marketing. Iran was the region’s
major oil producer, and Britain was able to keepout foreign competition, retaining control untilthe nationalisation dispute of 1951. The US oil
giants, meanwhile, worried about oil reserves in
the US, with the backing of the American admin-
istration, gained a large share of the oil conces-
sions, which were to prove the richest of the
Middle East after the Second World War: Aramco,
a consortium of US companies, secured oil rights
in Saudi Arabia; Gulf Oil, a half-share of the oilresources of Kuwait; and the US also gained a sharein Iraqi oil. Britain further agreed to share Iraqi oil
with France, whose spheres of inﬂuence in the

Middle East contained little oil. French-controlledSyria, and the Lebanon before 1945, earned addi-
tional royalties from the pipelines carrying oil from
the Iraqi Kirkuk ﬁeld to Tripoli; a ‘British’ line ran

through Transjordan and Palestine to Haifa. Untilthe mid-1950s Britain remained not only thedominant political power in the Middle East but
also the most important oil power.During the last decade of the twentieth and theearly years of the new century, the Western wars in1Chapter 37A PROFILE OF THE MIDDLE EASTAfghanistan and Iraq dominated world attention.Another essentially Western conﬂict between theIsraelis and Palestinians appeared no nearer to a
solution. Other enmities and conﬂicts within the
Arab world or between Arabs, Persians, Kurds andethnic and religious minorities have received farless attention in the West. Westerners tend to see
these societies of complex religious and ethnic
diversity as much more homogeneously Arab andIslamic than they are. Understanding the complexdivisions is a key to understanding the conﬂicts of
the Middle East. It is also true that, apart from
Turks, Kurds, Armenians, Jews and the Persians ofIran, the Middle East is predominantly Arab, andthat the majority of Arabs are followers of Islam.
This has created a sense of cultural unity: the
Koran and the Arab spoken language help Arabsto feel that they belong to one civilisation, andhundreds of thousands of Egyptians, Palestinians
and other Arab nationals, mainly technicians,
teachers and students, work and feel at home inArab countries other than their own, principally inthe oil-rich Gulf states. Although Islam is the
dominant faith of the great majority of the peoples
of the Middle East, not all Muslims are Arabs. TheTurks, the Iranians and the Kurds are ethnicallyquite distinct from the Arabs, as are many converts
to Islam. The ebb and flow of conquests is
reﬂected in the diverse cultures and religions ofthe Middle East. This becomes clearer as onelooks at the populations country by country.Modern Turkey, shorn of its Arab empire in1919, was the most homogeneous of the largeMiddle Eastern states. It was much less so by thetwenty-ﬁrst century, with a minority of 14 million
Kurds among its total population of 73 million.
Syria’s population was about 17.2 million at the
beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, of whommore than 1 million belong to some eleven dif-ferent Christian sects. Most Syrians are Sunni
Muslims, but a minority, the Alawite Muslim sect,
has built up a dominant military and political rolein recent years, though the Druze is anotherMuslim sect of importance in Syrian political life.
In Aleppo there is a large Christian minority.Iran (Persia) has a mainly Persian Shia Muslimpopulation of 36 million out of the whole popula-tion of 70.3 million in 2004. The division of Islam
into Sunni and Shia occurred a generation afterthe death of the Prophet Mohammed in AD632,following a dispute over the succession to thecaliphate. Ali, Mohammed’s ﬁrst cousin, lost this
contest, and his followers founded the Shia
branch, whose members look to their spiritualleaders for divine guidance on the interpretationof the Koran. The Sunni are also known as ortho-
dox Muslims. Differences between Shia and Sunni
have important political implications, for the Shiasare in a majority in Iran and in signiﬁcant minori-ties in neighbouring Lebanon. Worldwide, the
Shia branch comprises only one in ten Muslims. It
should be remembered that there are also non-Arab Muslims such as the Sunni and Shia Kurds ofIran, Iraq and Turkey. There are two major
minorities in Iran, 16 million Azeri Shiite Muslims
and some 5 million Kurds bordering Iraq’s Kurds.Iraq reflects the chequered composition ofMiddle Eastern countries. The majority of the
population at the start of the twenty-ﬁrst century
are Shia Muslim Arabs, 16 million out of the totalpopulation of 26 million (2004). They live in thesouth of the country. Northern Iraq is predom-
inantly Kurd. But there are also Turcoman and
Assyrians. The Kurds follow the Sunni branch ofMuslims. They are not Arabs, have preserved theirnational identity, language and culture despite
being partitioned between their neighbours,
Turkey, USSR, Iran and Iraq all anxious to sup-press them as dangerous minorities. In Iraq thereare 4.6 million Kurds. The country between the
north and south is inhabited by 8.9 million
dominant Sunni Arabs placed in key positions ofpower by Saddam Hussein, who is a Sunni Arab.There is enmity between the Sunni Arab centre
and the Kurdish north despite the religious link.
In the capital Baghdad there was a large and pros-
perous Jewish community until persecution led totheir mass exodus in 1950 to 1951. In the regionaround oil-rich Mosul there is an Assyrian
Christian minority. Iraq is an artiﬁcial creation,
once a pawn in the Middle Eastern carve-up bythe strongest powers in the region who intendedIraq to create balance and stability to the region
with its important oil resources. After the First
World War it became a British League of NationsMandate. In the major cities, with rapid urbani-sation, there is a mix of religions and ethnicity.
Baghdad is mainly Sunni and Basra, Shiite.418THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
The most religiously and ethnically dividedcountry is mountainous Lebanon, among whosepopulation of 3.7 million today no one group has
an overall majority. The Muslim population is
divided between Shia, Sunni and the Druze; theMaronite Catholic Christians, who have their ownpatriarch but accept the Pope as head of the
Church, are the largest single Christian group and,
together with other Christian communities, oncemade up about half the total population. Todaythe Muslims form the majority. So sensitive an
issue have precise population numbers been in the
Lebanon that no ofﬁcial census of the communities
has been taken for half a century. The breakdownin 1957 of a power-sharing agreement between
Maronites and Sunni, the so-called National Pact,
plus interference by neighbours, as well as by themilitant Palestinian Liberation Organisation,plunged the Lebanon into bloody civil war. At the
opening of the twenty-ﬁrst century the main divi-

sions were between 1.5 million Shiite Arabs, 1.6Sunni Arabs and 1.4 million Christians.The population of the territory underJordanian control after the 1967 war with Israel
was about 3.8 million in 1987. In the West Bank,assigned to Jordan (Transjordan) in 1949 afterthe ﬁrst Arab–Israeli War, there were a further
500,000 Arab Palestinians under Israeli control.
The relationship between Arab Jordanians andArab Palestinians who are seeking their own inde-pendence has been a strained one. The Jordanians
are Sunni Muslims; in the West Bank there is a
minority of Christians. In 2004, the total popu-lation of Israel is 7 million. In the occupied WestBank and Gaza occupied since 1967 there are
more than 3 million Palestinians and over
200,000 Israeli settlers. In Israel itself there are
more than 1 million Arabs.The Arabian peninsula’s most important stateis Saudi Arabia, unified by Ibn Saud and his
zealous followers, the Wahhabi, after the defeat
of his rival Hussain Sharif of Mecca in the 1920s,and in 2002 having a population of about 23.5million. Originally the poverty-stricken Bedouins
of Saudi Arabia and their tribal chiefs were of
political importance because they ruled over theholy cities of Mecca and Medina, and so, withBritish backing, could be set up as rival caliphs
appealing to the Muslims of the Ottoman andIndian empires against the Caliph Sultan ofTurkey. This proved of some value to Britain inthe First World War but its sponsorship proved
insufﬁcient to unite the Arabs. The tribes of the
Arabian peninsula were among the poorest in theMiddle East, and most of the peninsula, exceptfor the pilgrimage routes and the coastline, was
isolated from the rest of the world. Ibn Saud’s
new kingdom of Sunni Arabs was backward andpoor, his rule patriarchal. Patriarchal rule has con-tinued to the present day, but the kingdom has
become one of the richest in the world as a result
of the post-war development of the huge oil dis-coveries made in the 1930s. Before then, therehad been nothing to attract the British, who
maintained friendly relations and did not interfere
in Saudi Arabia’s internal affairs. Desperate forrevenue, Ibn Saud in 1933 granted concessionsfor oil-prospecting to American oil companies
which were exploited after the war by the Arabian
American Oil Company (Aramco).Similarly, the discovery and development of oilwells along the Persian Gulf, in Kuwait and
Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (Trucial
States) and Oman, transformed those regions ofthe Arabian peninsula into one of the wealthiestin the world. In contrast, Yemen, with a popula-
tion estimated at 19 million in 2002, has few
valuable resources and is very poor. But a numberof companies are continuing exploration for gas and oil and production is expanding. The
Yemenites belong to a branch of the Shia Muslims
– most Arabs are Sunni. Britain’s interests in theArabian peninsula, before the irruption of oil,were mainly strategic. To safeguard commercial
routes and the oil supplies from Iraq and Iran,
Britain held on to Aden and maintained protec-
torate relationships with the tribal sheikhs alongthe coastline of the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf.Egypt is among the largest Middle Easternstates but also one of the poorest. As elsewhere in
the region, the population has increased veryrapidly in the twentieth century and efforts tomodernise, and especially to improve the lot of 
the peasants, can scarcely keep pace with the rate
of population growth from some 18 million in1947 to an estimated 73 million ﬁfty-seven yearslater. The great majority of Egyptians are Sunni
Muslims, but there is a minority of Arab-speaking1A PROFILE OF THE MIDDLE EAST419
Copts (Greek for Egyptian), who have followedChristianity under their own patriarchs. Mostmembers of an ancient community of Jews were
expelled after 1956.The Sudan, to the south, which shares the life-giving Nile with Egypt, was nominally underAnglo-Egyptian rule from 1899 until independ-
ence in 1956 but it was, in reality, controlled by
Britain. The main ethnic division is between themixed, mainly Sunni Muslim peoples of thenorthern and central regions and the southern
tribes, which tend to be either pagan or Christian
converts. Some have been converted to Islam,others resist northern attempts at Islamisation.This division, which has often led to conﬂict and
warfare, remains one of the most serious internal
problems facing the modern Sudan’s 31.1 millioninhabitants (2000 ﬁgure), of whom just under athird belong to one of the black African peoples.
In western Sudan in the Darfur region, African
people started a revolt and one million weredriven out by Arab militias, villages burnt and50,000 killed in 2004. The great majority of
Libya’s 5.3 million people in 2000 were Sunni
Muslims; Arabic is the national language, thoughsome Berber-speaking districts remain. Once oneof the poorest Arab countries, comprised as it is
largely of desert, the discovery of oil in the 1960s
transformed the economy and the ambitions ofthe Libyan political leadership.The Middle East is overwhelmingly Arab andIslamic. There are constant appeals to Arab unity
and Islamic solidarity, as well as calls for the polit-ical organisation of an Arab League. Unions ofdifferent Arab nations are talked about and even
established, though only for short periods. The
State of Israel was seen as the common enemy,
the intruder that has seized Arab lands and alien-ated most of Palestine from Arab rule. By thetwenty-ﬁrst century the Arab world has accepted
that Israel has established itself securely and its
neighbours, with more or less willingness, areaccommodating themselves to reality. As we haveseen, the sense of a common civilisation and lan-
guage and the pride in Islam are shared by mil-
lions of Arabs, and the educated classes areconscious of these links across national frontiers.But nationalism is relatively new to the Arabs,
except in Egypt, which was inﬂuenced by theNapoleonic invasion and Western ideas in thenineteenth century. Socialism, industrial develop-ment and demands for constitutional government
are other signs of the Western impact on the
Middle East of the nineteenth and twentieth cen-turies, but they have not got very far.After the defeat of 1918 the Turks became astrongly nationalist country under Mustafa Kemal,known as Kemal Atatürk (Father of the Turks).Modern Turkey with a population in 2000 of 66.7
million is based on the military success of Atatürk,
who deﬁed the Western Allies and by 1923 had re-established complete Turkish sovereignty over itsterritories, shorn of the Arab empire, by threaten-
ing to ﬁght again for his country. The legacy was
bitter rivalry with Greece, which had to abandonits own attempted expansion in Asia Minor. It is arivalry that persists to the present day, with dis-
putes in the Aegean and over the future of Cyprus.
Mustafa Kemal broke with Ottoman and Muslimtraditions and during the ﬁfteen years of his rule aspresident forced Westernisation on the Turks,
breaking the power of the clergy. The Atatürk tra-
dition, under which the military became theguardian of the nation, lives on. In modellinginstitutions on the West in the 1930s, Atatürk
combined a parliamentary system with his own
virtual one-party rule and cult of personality. Hisprotegé and successor was Ismet Inönü, who waspresident from 1938 to 1950 and prime minister
from 1961 to 1965. But in the aftermath of the
Second World War and in alliance with the US,there was both external and internal pressure formore democratic rule. Strife-ridden civilian gov-
ernments have been replaced intermittently by
repressive military rule. The democratic tradition
is weak.Three peoples were denied the right to formtheir own independent nations in the carve-up of
the Ottoman Empire: the Armenians, the
Palestinian Arabs and the Kurds. The Armenians,with a history of independence and subjectiongoing back to ancient times, seemed the most
likely to gain independence after the collapse of
the Ottoman Empire, under whose rule they hadsuffered genocidal atrocities. Britain and Francehoped that the US would accept a mandate over
Armenia, still partitioned between Turks and420THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
Russians, but the US Senate rejected the notion.Nevertheless, by the Treaty of Sèvres an inde-pendent Armenian republic was recognised in
1920, but the West made no attempt to defend
the new state when Turkey and Soviet Russiaattacked and divided the republic between themin December of that year.The Kurds, who had struggled for independ-ence when under Ottoman rule, took heart fromWilson’s promise of self-determination and fromthe defeat of the Turks. The same Treaty of
Sèvres recognised the creation of independent
Kurdistan, but Kemal Atatürk tore up the treatyand forced the Allies to revise it by the Treaty ofLausanne in 1923; by then he had conquered
Kurdistan. In the ﬁnal disposition of the Ottoman
Empire the Kurds found themselves minorities inﬁve states. In 2000 it is estimated 600,000 livedin the USSR, 4.7 million in Iran, 3.6 million in
Iraq, 1.7 million in Syria and 14 million in
Turkey. They have rebelled sporadically, always tobe savagely repressed. The tragedy of the Kurdsin the aftermath of the second Gulf War, when in
March 1991 they rose against Saddam Hussein 
in Iraq, is that no nation wants to raise the issueof an independent Kurdistan. The US wishes to build a ‘stable peace’ in the region through an
alliance of Arab states, Iran, Turkey and the
Soviet Union and these have a common interestin suppressing Kurdish nationalism in their owncountries. The Palestinian diaspora also had its
origins in the aftermath of the First World War.
For more than half a century the sense of nationalidentity which characterises these three peopleshas not been extinguished – nor, as the twenty-
ﬁrst century begins, is it likely to be.Radio and television can mobilise the masses inways not dreamed of in the days of the OttomanEmpire. In addition, the movement of the ruralpopulation to the cities has been a phenomenon
throughout much of the less developed world,
including the Middle East. In 2000 some 6 mil-lion have crowded into Teheran, Iran’s capital;Cairo’s population exceeds 10 million; and even in
the Lebanon, a country with a small population,
close to a million live in Beirut. The explosivegrowth of urban living, the increase, especially intowns, of literacy, the frustrations and the thirstfor activity among student groups, the restlessnessof unemployed labour existing on the margins of subsistence, the abject poverty of most of the
peoples of the Middle East, all these have added
greatly to the volatility of the region and created agulf between the urban and rural populations.In the rural areas, despite some ambitious pro-jects, high population growth has negated the
advances in crop yields and agricultural methods,leaving the peasants no less backward and poor. Inthe oil-rich states – Saudi Arabia and those along
the Persian Gulf – agriculture is of little import-
ance. In Iran and Iraq, however, despite the rev-enues from oil, agriculture must absorb the labourand provide a subsistence living for up to half the
population. So the possession of oil alone does not
solve the economic problems of these states.The purchasing power of the oil-rich states hasturned them into vital elements in the Western
world’s economic advancement. Underdevelop-
ment and backwardness rub shoulders with ambi-tious modern projects and international airports inthe Middle Eastern states. In great-power contests
it remains a region of strategic importance. The
continuities of cultures and religions provide linkswith the past, but there are also huge differencesas a result of the transformation that occurred in
the twentieth century.The resurgence of militant fundamentalism,especially after the overthrow of the Shah of Iranby the Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, threatened
to destabilise the whole region. It was not only a
reaction against Western dominance, whetherRussian, British or American, but also a reversalof the road to Western modernisation taken by
Turkey under Mustafa Kemal after the First
World War. Thus rival Islamic ideological con-
flicts were added to the Western ideologicalconfrontations of ‘socialism’ and ‘capitalism’.Among the more powerful nations there is alsoa continuous struggle for regional predominance.
In the 1980s there were several such national andinternational conflicts. A bloody war betweenIraq and Iran was followed by Saddam Hussein’s
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, which lined
Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Westernpowers up against him and led to the second GulfWar in January 1991. 1A PROFILE OF THE MIDDLE EAST421
After the conclusion of the peace settlements fol-lowing the First World War, Britain attempted,
for a time successfully, to secure the beneﬁts of
empire in the Middle East while minimising thecosts of control. Its time-honoured way of achiev-ing this was to maintain old social structures and
unreconstructed traditional rulers. Modernisation
and democratisation was at best half-hearted,
since mass nationalism would have threatened
British dominance.The Ottoman khedive of Egypt became a kingunder British supervision. The Hashemite amirs
of Arabia were transformed into sovereign rulers.
The Arab states were also provided with consti-
tutions; assemblies were ‘elected’ and ministerswere appointed who were supposedly responsibleto the assemblies. British ‘advisers’ made sure that
law and order were maintained and Britain’s
interests preserved. These arrangements proved
unstable and, after the Second World War, pro-
gressively collapsed in Egypt, Iraq and the Sudan.Although not an Arab state, Iran (Persia) was sub-jected to a similar pattern of indirect rule after the
war. This merely continued, in this region, the
policy followed before the 1914 war. Britain was
inventive in devising constitutional and inter-
national arrangements that gave it what was nec-essary to protect its imperial interests without
saddling it with responsibility for the welfare of
the indigenous peoples of the countries it con-
trolled. An exception was Aden, which wasannexed in the nineteenth century and became acolony ruled outright by Britain; its population,however, was small. A more ingenious solution
was found for the Sudan, reconquered in 1898,
which became half a colony, a so-called condo-minium, shared between Egypt and Britain in1899; in reality, both Egypt and the Sudan were
administered by Britain. Britain did not attempt
to rule over the Arabs living in the sheikhdoms
of the Indian Ocean or the Persian Gulf, or in the
interior of Arabia. Instead, special treaties weresigned and protectorates proclaimed excludingany foreign inﬂuence other than British. Iraq,
Iran, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt were
ostensibly independent countries bound only to
Britain by treaties of alliance ‘freely concluded’against this general background of its imperialpolicy in the Middle East; the position of
Palestine, a large, predominantly Arab land for
which Britain assumed direct responsibility under
the League Mandate, was different. From the
ﬁrst, Palestine proved a troublesome possession.Far from providing Britain with a friendly andsecure base in the Middle East, increasing
numbers of troops from Britain’s small army had
to be assigned to Palestine just to try to keep the
peace. In other parts of the Middle East Britishpolicy also ran into constant problems. It wasalready too late and too expensive to extend
imperial control by the mixture of force, efﬁcient
administration and paternalism that Britain had so
successfully adopted in the heyday of imperialism.Taking on the heritage of the Ottoman rulersChapter 38THE MIDDLE EAST BETWEEN TWO WORLDWARS, 1919–45
after the First World War turned out to be farmore difﬁcult than the British had expected. Notall the different ethnic and religious groups
accepted the Arab rulers imposed on them. The
largely desert regions of the former Ottoman
lands that Britain had now acquired, with theirstretches of irrigated territory along the coastlinesand river banks, were divided into Palestine,
Transjordan and Iraq. The ‘royal’ protégés whom
Britain appointed to rule the Arab states were two
sons of the Hashemite Sharif Husain of Mecca,
Abdullah and Faisal. What territories they wouldactually rule remained uncertain, a detail not suf-ﬁciently worked out in 1919, especially as the
French had their own ideas about how to govern
Syria and Lebanon, the Arab territories that had
been assigned to them. Abdullah had hoped tobecome king of Iraq with Faisal as king of Syria.Faisal actually established himself in Syria for a
short time until he was driven out by the French.
The British then decided to install Faisal as king
of Iraq, which left his brother disappointed.Abdullah, at the head of a contingent of tribalforces, in turn threatened to avenge Faisal’s
unceremonious expulsion from French Syria, at
the same time putting forward claims to rule over
an Arab Palestine, claims that were totally unac-
ceptable to the British. Instead, the territoriesacross the Jordan, the Transjordan, were separ-ated from Palestine and constituted into a separ-
ate state in 1921 with Amir Abdullah as ruler.
This was intended as no more than a temporary
arrangement until the French agreed to allowAbdullah to become king of Syria. But this theFrench never did. Syria thus nurses a historical
grievance. The ruler of small, barren Transjordan
hankered after Jerusalem but was totally depend-
ent on Britain.The creation of these states was not based onany logical or natural divisions. Nor were theybased on the Wilsonian principle of what the
people wished, even supposing this could have
been accurately discovered. Instead they derived
from machinations of a few leaders and from thepower play of Britain and France. Ottoman domin-
ion was more easily destroyed than replaced.The one country with clear national frontierswas Egypt. Britain’s dominance was difﬁcult tojustify after the First World War. Egypt hadreceived continuous Western tutelage since theBritish occupation began, and an efﬁcient admin-
istration had been built up with outstanding and
powerful British proconsuls, modestly named
‘consul-generals’ (because Turkish suzerainty wasacknowledged until 1914). The Sudan too wasunder effective British control, as we have seen,
though in theory it was shared with Egypt.
During the war of 1914–18 Egypt was declared
a British protectorate; a strong military base was
established and all protest was suppressed. Thewar nevertheless brought about change. It createdwealth among a minority of Egyptian merchants,
and a small Egyptian elite evolved, whose
members became determined to remove British
control and govern the country in their owninterests rather than Britain’s. But they were splitbetween the supporters of the monarchy and sup-
porters of a nationalist party, the Wafd, led by
Sa’ad Zaghlul, who in 1918 made himself
spokesman of the nationalist cause. How couldEgypt be denied independence when it waspromised to the backward Bedouin Arabs? After
riots and demonstrations Egypt was offered
limited independence. Zaghlul objected. He also
demanded that Egypt should have a say in the
Sudan, for control of the headwaters of the Nilewas regarded as vital by the Egyptians, who weredependent upon its water. No one in Cairo would
conclude a treaty on British terms, so Britain in
1922 unilaterally proclaimed a limited Egyptian
independence but reserved all those rights con-sidered essential to British interests including mil-itary control of the Suez Canal.So-called constitutional politics now revolvedaround the rivalry for power among the group 
of Wafdist politicians supported by wealthy land-
owners and the corrupt supporters of the king.Between Britain and an elected Egyptian Wafdgovernment a modus vivendi was at long last
achieved by the signature of an Anglo-Egyptian
alliance in August 1936. British troops were with-
drawn from Egypt’s main towns but British airand land bases were maintained to guard the SuezCanal, and the Royal Navy had free use of the har-
bour of Alexandria. In the event of war or the
imminent threat of it, the Egyptian government1THE MIDDLE EAST BETWEEN TWO WORLD WARS, 1919–45423
promised Britain its full support and unrestricteduse of all Egyptian facilities and territory. Underthe terms of the treaty the Egyptian army would
also pass under British command in wartime. For
a while all seemed peace and harmony and the 
foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, was even fea-tured on Egyptian postage stamps. But within two years there was renewed bitterness about the
continued presence of British troops.During the 1939–45 war King Farouk and theEgyptian government proved uncertain allies.
Egypt did not declare war on Germany and Italy,but was nonetheless ‘defended’ by the BritishEighth Army against Rommel’s Afrika Korps.
Meantime, Farouk and his government were
making secret overtures to Hitler in 1941, pro-
fessing to welcome a German occupation. Hatredof Britain played a part, but there may also havebeen an element of reinsurance in case Rommel,
as seemed likely, entered Cairo victorious. The
British victory at El Alamein in 1942 settled
Egypt’s immediate future, since Britain’s wartimeneeds overrode all notions of genuine Egyptianindependence. To the Egyptians at the end of the
war what stood out starkly was not that they had
been defended against a German invasion but
that, despite Britain’s recognition of their inde-
pendence in 1936, the British remained virtuallyan occupying power ten years later. By then aneconomically exhausted but still militarily domin-
ant Britain faced a chorus of strident nationalist
demands to revise the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of
1936 and to hand complete independence overto Egypt’s rival political leadership. As elsewherein the Arab world, after 1945 Britain was faced
in Egypt with the immensely difficult task of
appeasing an Arab nationalism that was now
stronger than ever.Treaties and a special relationship also protectedBritish interests in Iraq which became a British
mandate after the First World War. In many ways
Britain carried on where the Ottoman rulers had
left off. Except in non-Arab Persia, where ShiaMuslims are the majority, the Arab governingelite in country after country was chosen from the
same group, the Sunni Muslims, whether they
were in a majority as in the Arabian peninsula orin a minority as in Iraq. Other minorities, com-munities of Kurds, Christians and Jews, were leftto the mercy of the Sunnis, as were some major-
ity groups, such as the Shia Muslims of Iraq. The
Iraqi Shiites were not reconciled to alien or Sunni
rule and rose in revolt in 1920. The British helpedto suppress the rising, the Royal Air Force bru-tally bombing the rebels into submission. The
British then proceeded to install the Amir Faisal
as king, but Iraq remained an unstable kingdom,
with an ineffective and corrupt parliament. A few
years later, in 1933, the Iraqi army carried out ahorrifying massacre of Christian Assyrians. TheBritish did not intervene; good relations with Iraq
took priority.The monarchy set up by the British did notprove a strong stabilising inﬂuence. After Faisal’sdeath in 1933, his playboy son succeeded, onlyto be killed six years later in one of his many
sports cars. As in all the newly independent but
politically underdeveloped states, the indigenous
army played an increasingly important role. Bythe 1930s Iraqi independence was internationallyrecognised; Britain appeared to have fulﬁlled its
task and preserved its interests in the form of a
treaty signed in 1930 with a nominally inde-

pendent Iraq. But internally Iraq remained as
unstable as before, and in 1936 a successful coupsaw the start of a series of military interventionsin government.At the start of the Second World War theGerman National Socialists seemed to many Iraqis
to be natural allies; not only were they at war withthe hated British, but they were enforcing a pro-gramme of anti-Jewish racial policies and were
apparently ready to allow the Arabs their own way
in Palestine. Germany’s victories in 1940 and
1941 proved even more persuasive in turning Iraq
away from the Allies. It now looked likely thatBritain’s dominance of the Middle East would bebroken. Although, Iraq was bound to Britain by
special treaty, the country became a centre for
anti-British Arab activity, and in the spring of
1941 a pro-German coup drove out the Regentand his government. For Britain the situation wasvery dangerous. With vital British interests,
including the continued flow of oil from the
Kirkuk wells, at stake, Churchill ordered the424THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
occupation of Iraq by British and Indian troopsin May 1941. For the remainder of the war, andindeed for some years after, Britain was able to
reassert its dominance, until it all collapsed in
another bloody Iraqi coup in 1958.Persia, during the First World War, was a par-titioned country divided between Russia andBritain until the Russians departed after the
Bolshevik Revolution. The end of the war in
1918 left the British in a dominant position with
sole rights to the exploitation of Persian oil. As in
Iraq, Britain in 1921 moved away from directcontrol to indirect inﬂuence. Among the leaderswho seized power in Persia was the self-appointed
commander of the Cossack Brigade, Reza Khan.
He soon extended his military power over the
whole country, crushing tribal revolts and polit-ical opposition, and dignifying his authoritarianrule with a constitutional façade. The Persian par-
liament, the Majlis, was dependent upon the
rulers, not the other way round.In 1925 Reza Khan had himself chosen as thenew Shah and declared the foundation of thePahlavi dynasty, whose survival he sought to
ensure by despotic rule and the murder of oppo-
nents. Britain did not intervene and regarded it as
in its best interests to deal with a strong ruler,
allowing agreements to be made that would notbe jeopardised by changes of leadership. Whatmattered was to maintain the Anglo-Persian oil
concessions and the bulk of the proﬁts. As oil pro-
duction increased, the royalties paid to the Shah
also grew; these he used to strengthen his army.Following the example of Kemal Atatürk, heforced Westernisation through. The emancipation
of women and the spread of Western inﬂuences,
especially education, began to change Iran,
though more in the towns than in the countryside.
Communications were improved and there wassome industrial development. Centralised govern-ment, a growing bureaucracy and a new army rep-
resented the modern face of Persia, renamed Iran
in 1935; but, for the masses of the poor, little was
done. The Shah favoured the rich, the merchantsand the landlords, over the majority, the poorpeasants, from whom taxes and military service
were exacted. To the poor’s resentment against
the rich was added a religious dimension: the peas-ants remained faithful to traditional Muslim teach-ing, while the middle and upper classes tended toWestern secularism. The Shah’s efforts to stimu-
late modernisation widened rather than narrowed
the differences between the poor 90 per cent and
the privileged few at the top of the social pyramid.The seeds of reaction were sown.The Shah wished to throw off British inﬂuenceand was attracted, when the Second World War
began, to National Socialist Germany, as were
other Middle Eastern leaders. In the midst of a
devastating war Britain could not afford to jeop-ardise its oil supplies. The German invasion of theSoviet Union in June 1941 gave Iran an added
importance as a vital Allied supply route to the
Russians. With Britain and the Soviet Union now
allies, joint action was agreed. In August 1941British and Russian troops invaded Iran anddeposed the Shah. The 21-year-old Mohammed
Reza succeeded his father as Shah. Under Allied
supervision mass politics were encouraged, with
the Russians, the Americans and the Britishseeking to broaden their support among thepeople. Thus the Russians promoted a pro-Soviet
Tudeh Party with its base in the Soviet-occupied
north. The British supported tribal leaders in the
south. The disruption the war brought to Iran
compounded the problems from which thecountry was already suffering, but the nationalcrises were postponed until the war’s conclusion.France’s power and role in the Middle East wasonce second only to Britain’s. Despite France’ssuccess in penetrating the eastern Mediterraneanculturally and commercially – French became the
language of the educated elite – French power
was eroded by two world wars. The British suc-
ceeded in limiting France’s share of Ottoman
spoils to the Lebanon and to a Syria muchreduced in size. France showed little interest inguiding its mandate to independence.In 1920 the French made short shrift ofFaisal’s Syrian kingdom. They then proceeded to
divide their mandate into ﬁve separate adminis-trative nations and, when this proved unworkable,into two states (in 1925), the Lebanon and Syria.
The mandatory governments were firmly con-

trolled by the French military on the model of1THE MIDDLE EAST BETWEEN TWO WORLD WARS, 1919–45425
Morocco. Nationalist demonstrations and, all themore so, rebellions were harshly suppressed.Complete military control was the prior condition
of France’s civilising mission. In the aftermath of
a serious Muslim revolt in Syria in 1925–6, the
French decided it was expedient to grant moreautonomy and proclaimed a Syrian republic in1930 with a parliamentary constitution. Whereas
Britain fostered Arab ‘monarchies’, the French
promoted ‘republics’. In 1936 a French–Syrian
treaty, following the British example in Iraq,
sought to lay the basis of a partnership betweenSyria and France in place of outright French domination. Arab nationalism in Syria was not
satisfied. The French military and bureaucracy
maintained close supervisory control, their pres-
ence making it evident who the real rulers were.In the Lebanon, the French faced less opposi-tion, and the constitution which they imposed
sought carefully to distribute the ofﬁces and rep-
resentation among the principal groups of inhab-
itants. But nationalist opposition to the Frenchoccupation developed among both the ChristianMaronites and the Muslims. France’s domination
of the Levant became a vital symbol of its con-
tinued role as a great power.France took its cultural mission seriously andmade sacriﬁces for it. Money and teachers werepoured in to provide French education; hospitalswere built and French judicial codes introduced.
Communications improved, Beirut turned into
one of the Middle East’s best harbours, modern
cities with ﬁne public buildings and adequate util-ities transformed the Ottoman towns and, mostimportant of all, a genuine effort was made to
improve the lot of the peasant, with impressive
increases in agricultural productivity. France thus
made a real and genuine contribution to the well-
being of the peoples of Syria and the Lebanon.In Syria and the Lebanon in 1940, as well asNorth Africa, however, the French administration
and army remained loyal to the government of
Vichy France, and obeyed its orders. Although
the generals on the spot wanted to ﬁght on, sus-picion of Britain’s intentions also remainedstrong. As long as Syria and the Lebanon did not
become an enemy base, Britain, beset by enough
difﬁculties already, was prepared to leave Vichyundisturbed in the Levant. But the Syrians,impressed by the German victories, becameincreasingly pro-Nazi. Syria was the key. The
Germans arranged to send military supplies to
Iraq by way of neighbouring Vichy Syria. Vichy
agreed to cooperate in return for substantialGerman concessions in France. The Vichy gov-ernment also agreed to defend Syria against a
British attack. So German planes landed on Syrian
airﬁelds with supplies for Iraq; but the effort was
in vain. Churchill acted ruthlessly. If necessary the
British would ﬁght their former allies. Iraq as hasbeen seen was occupied before German suppliescould get through and then, in June 1941,
Britain, together with the Free French forces,
invaded Syria and the Lebanon.The Syrian and Lebanese campaigns signiﬁeda deep humiliation for France. The bulk of theFrench forces had refused to join the Free French
troops and, though they capitulated, had been
allowed to return to Vichy France. Despite the
ceremonial return of Syria and the Lebanon toFree France, it was the British who were the clearmasters of the situation. Capitalising on this,
Britain demanded that the Free French proclaim,
in order to appeal to Arab opinion throughout
the Middle East, that the Lebanon and Syria
would be free. De Gaulle had no choice but tocomply. Deeply resentful, he accused Britain ofdriving France out of the Levant.De Gaulle in 1945 was more concerned to re-establish French authority. In May he ordered
military action and a number of Syrian townswere shelled and bombed. But this was not 1920.Britain was in a position both of overwhelming
military might and of decisive political inﬂuence
in Europe and the Middle East. Supported by the
US, Britain forced the French out. It was a humil-
iating end to French rule, and de Gaulle neitherforgot nor forgave.The French were able to take comfort two yearslater when British rule in Palestine came to an end.
Although Britain’s Balfour Declaration had pow-erfully contributed to the creation of the State ofIsrael, there were in 1945 many Jews who no
longer saw in Britain a benevolent friend. British
policies had not won Arab friendship either.426THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
Biblical Palestine was a familiar concept in theWest, but at the close of the First World War fewpeople in Britain or elsewhere had more than the
vaguest notion of its geographical extent; King
David’s and Solomon’s empire had included much
of today’s Syria and Jordan, Egypt’s Sinai as wellas contemporary Israel. There was no simple guideto what the modern territorial frontiers should be
since Palestine as a country had ceased to exist
under the Ottoman Turks. It was the British who
re-created Palestine within its post-1919 frontiers.
To the north were Syria and Lebanon: how farshould these countries extend? Agreement on thefrontier was reached with the French government;
then, in 1922, the British decided to divide their
sphere along the River Jordan, which thus formed
the eastern frontier of Palestine. Beyond the riverto the east a new country was created: the BritishMandate of Transjordan.The importance of these artiﬁcial frontiers wasnever accepted as ﬁnal by the peoples who lived
within them. Syria could dream of being reunitedwith the Lebanon and of establishing a greaterSyria by incorporating land belonging to present-
day Israel. Jordan claimed Palestinian lands west
of the river, including Jerusalem. Israel claimed
the West Bank – in biblical times Judaea and
Samaria – which before 1947 was part of thePalestine Mandate. Possession has been decidedby war and conquest and the Arab Palestinians
have no country of their own. Within the man-
dated territory of Palestine as geographically
deﬁned in 1922 the Jews were to be permitted tobuild their National Home among the 650,000Palestinian Arabs already living there.As only 68,000 Jews inhabited Palestine in1919 there could be no question of forming a
Jewish state immediately. A National Home was
a vaguer phrase; but there was no doubt aboutthe end in view. Zionists, and also such powerfulstatesmen as Churchill, Smuts and Lloyd George,
believed that a progressive Jewish state would, in
future years, be re-created; the Balfour Declara-
tion of 1917 was seen as providing a promise ofassistance towards the goal of a pro-British Jewishstate. Until events proved otherwise, the Pales-
tinian Arab population was regarded by the
British as too sunk in poverty and backwardnessto merit consideration. In some ofﬁcial papersthey were contemptuously referred to as mixed‘Levantines’. The racial arrogance of an out-
moded imperialist frame of mind was thus super-
imposed on the complicated Palestine issue.
There was a signiﬁcant silence about the politicalrights of the majority of the inhabitants ofPalestine in the Balfour Declaration; they were
given no more than an assurance that the ‘civil
and religious rights’ of the ‘non-Jewish popula-
tion’ would not be prejudiced, although they
were the overwhelming majority. Leading Zion-ists recognised that a Jewish state was a distantprospect and would require large-scale immigra-
tion of Jews; but that Jews in their masses would
actually come was a matter of faith.In 1919 the majority of Palestine’s 68,000Jews were settled in Jerusalem, most of themorthodox Jews who had lived there under
Ottoman rule for four centuries in their own reli-
gious communities. These religious Jews were
generally opposed to the aims of the ‘new’ latenineteenth-century Jewish immigrants fromEurope inspired by Zionist ideals of nationalism
and statehood. It was persecution of Jews in the
Russian Empire especially, and widespread anti-
Semitism, which had led to the birth of Zionism
before the First World War. Some 16,000 Zionistpioneers had settled in what had been part of theOttoman Empire, mainly in agricultural colonies
but also in towns. Working on the inhospitable
land they had been inspired by the belief that they
were laying the basis of a state for the Jewishpeople. Zionists asserted, with Theodor Herzl,that the Jews were a people, dispersed in history,
but one people wherever they now lived. One day
they would return to Palestine, their historical
country. The early Zionists saw themselves as
colonisers reclaiming Jewish land, precursors ofthe Jewish nation. But the world was ruled by thegreat powers, so the Zionists would need the
sympathy and protection of one of these if they
were to set about building their own nation.
Theodor Herzl had tried to enlist the help of theGerman kaiser. The Zionist leader Dr ChaimWeizmann turned to Britain.The Jews bought land in Palestine and on thisland built their kibbutz, their own agricultural1THE MIDDLE EAST BETWEEN TWO WORLD WARS, 1919–45427
communities. The majority of the Arab populationwas seen by the Zionists and their Western sup-
porters as beneﬁting rather than suffering from this
economic development of the barren Palestine soil,
which Jewish zeal and skill would turn into pro-

ductive plantations. It was a vision wounding tothe pride of the Arab elites, conscious of their ownculture and resenting the label of backwardness.
From this followed the Arab identification of
Zionism with ‘Western imperialism’. There were
also educated, moderate Arabs who got on well
with their Jewish neighbours, but the Jewish andArab societies in Palestine were different from thebeginning and the differences widened rather than
narrowed. With the growing influx of Jewish
immigrants, Jewish society became overwhelm-

ingly European, democratic and socialist. Arabsociety, on the other hand, was traditional andpatriarchal, and the few wealthy Arab landowners
dominated the poor tenants scratching a living
from the soil. Paradoxically, Arab landowners prof-

ited greatly from Zionism: because the Jews wereeager to buy land, property values soared, and Arabwealth was hugely augmented. The growth of
Jewish industry and commerce also introduced a
new factor and built, adjoining an Arab town like
Jaffa, the modern Tel Aviv. Development increased
the gulf between the more prosperous urban andagricultural Jews and the mass of poor Arabs. Thefundamental problem was whether Arab or Jew
would ultimately control Palestine.The rate of Jewish immigration and the relatedquestion of Jewish land purchases were, in theearly years, at the heart of that problem. The Arabsdid not, after all, turn out to be a negligible polit-
ical factor. There was indeed a widespread Arab
reaction against the Balfour Declaration. Arab
nationalism and expectations had been aroused by
Faisal’s establishment of an Arab kingdom inDamascus in 1918.In October 1919 Curzon, who did not sharehis predecessor’s Zionist sympathies, replaced
Balfour as foreign secretary. British ofﬁcial views
were hardening against the wider Zionist aspi-rations and moving towards a policy of even-handedness as between Arabs and Jews, which
meant taking the Arab point of view into account.
What the Arabs feared was that, as soon as a largeJewish population was built up in Palestine, theZionists would impose their own Jewish state onall the Palestinian people. Accordingly, they
wished Jewish immigration to be restricted. By
early 1920, tension between the Zionists and 
the Arabs had risen dangerously. The Britishresponded by limiting Jewish immigration andimposing a quota of 16,500 for one year. This
was, even so, more than the Arab political lead-
ership could accept and they organised their fol-
lowers to react with violence. In May 1921 Arabs
attacked Jews and Jews retaliated. By the time theBritish could bring the violence under control,forty-eight Arabs and forty-seven Jews had been
killed. It was the beginning of the tragic sequence
of bloody Arab–Zionist conﬂicts.The British now tried to allay Arab fears andto make further concessions to their views. Firstimmigration was suspended, then it was an-
nounced that Jewish immigration would be
strictly controlled, restricted to the economic
absorptive capacity of the country. The Jews werenot to take over the whole of Palestine: theirNational Home would be established in only a
part of the country. But this reassurance had a
boomerang effect, for Churchill, as colonial 
secretary, also explained that the Palestinian Arab
majority could not expect to be set on the pathto independence like the other Arab mandates,owing to the pledge of a National Home given
to the Jews. The denial of independence to the
Jews because of the Arabs, and to the Arabs
because of the Jews, had all the makings of abankrupt policy. Finally, the British undertook totake some account of local political attitudes; a
legislative council, with more Arab members than
Jewish, as well as British nominees, would be set
up. The British hope was that the Jews and Arabs
would work together in this forum, but the Arabsrejected the proposal out of hand. They alsorefused to form any representative Arab organisa-
tion in parallel with the existing Zionist organi-
sation, later known as the Jewish Agency. The
refusal of the Arabs to cooperate politically withthe British, and to provide an elective Council ofPalestinian Arabs, weakened their position. The
Jewish Agency, meanwhile, became the nucleus of
an effective government for the Jews.428THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
The problem of the Jewish state and the pres-sure of would-be Jewish settlers appeared to beeasing in the 1920s. After an initial inﬂux of Jews,
immigration slackened. In 1927 more Jews actu-
ally left Palestine than entered, and in 1928 the
net increase was only ten. However, Zionists andArabs still wanted assurance about the future. TheBritish Labour government elected in 1929, buf-
feted by Zionist demands for a coherently deﬁned
policy, did not follow a steady course: in 1930
promises were made to halt Jewish immigration
altogether; then, in 1931, it was allowed to con-tinue. This tendency to veer ﬁrst one way andthen the other only encouraged more violence in
Palestine and increased the pressure on London
from both sides in the struggle to influence
British policy.It was Hitler’s persecution of the Jews inGermany, and the rest of the world’s rejection of
large-scale Jewish immigration, however, that
more than anything transformed the Palestine
question in the 1930s and after the Second WorldWar. All of a sudden there were hundreds ofthousands of Jews who wished to escape the
Reich in addition to those leaving Poland and
central Europe. The fate of the Jews of contin-
ental Europe appeared to prove the Zionist case
that the Jews would always be maltreated and sohad to possess a country of their own. Before1933 only a minority of German Jews had sup-
ported Zionism though prominent men were
among them. The great migratory wave of Jews
from the late nineteenth century onwards movedout of Russia and Romania west to Germany,France, Britain and, above all, the US. Hitler’s
violent persecution converted more Jews in the
1930s than Herzl had done. But from 1936
onwards conversion to Zionism was less import-
ant a factor in the pressure to enter Palestine thanthe closing of the doors of the European coun-tries and the US to large-scale immigration of the
increasingly desperate German and, later,
Austrian and Czechoslovak Jews who had fallen
under Nazi German rule, in addition to the con-tinued emigration from central Europe. Theirfellow Jews in Palestine were willing to provide
refuge and to share their possessions; Jews in
other countries were willing to provide ﬁnancialaid to enable their persecuted co-religionists toemigrate; the Germans wanted to force them outof the expanding Reich, yet the British manda-
tory authority in Palestine, fearing Arab reactions,
barred the way to any but controlled immigra-
tion. Nevertheless, between 1932 and 1936 thequotas were sufﬁciently large for the Jews whowished to leave Germany and to settle in Palestine
to be able to do so, encouraged by the National
Socialists, who for a time agreed to the transfer
of a proportion of Jewish property. Emigration
from Germany soared, reaching a peak of 62,000in 1935 alone.The surge of Jews lay at the root of Arab fears.If the Jews gained a majority in Palestine they
would not be satisﬁed with a Jewish Home in
Palestine, but would demand a sovereign Jewishstate, to which the Arabs, still in a majority,would be subjected. In just two decades from
1919 to 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine
had increased sevenfold, while the Arab popula-
tion had not quite doubled. The trend was all tooclear. With ﬁnancial help from abroad, the Jewspurchased land from absentee Arab landlords and
found work for their co-religionists. The dis-

placed Arab tenants and workers were aroused to
religious fanaticism and hatred of the Jews by
Arab politicians led by the Mufti of Jerusalem,Haj Amin. Haj Amin, a nationalist, was corruptand totally unscrupulous in dealing with Arab op-
position to his leadership; murder of Arab oppo-
nents and terror became an unstated part of his
political programme. Yet he also enjoyed genu-ine large-scale backing from Palestinian Arabs fearful of the spectre of a Zionist-dominated
Palestine.The Arab nationalist movement was implacablyhostile to any Jewish development or to Jewish–
Arab collaboration. The Mufti mobilised the1THE MIDDLE EAST BETWEEN TWO WORLD WARS, 1919–45429

Arabs not only against the Jews but also againstthe British. In the spring of 1936 an Arab strikewas called and violence broke out. Jews were 
once again the target and for a time the Arab
political leadership presented an unaccustomed
united front. But the British hit back, refusingto reduce Jewish immigration and imprisoning Arab terrorists. Palestine was on the verge of civil
war. Determined to restore order and to ﬁnd a
solution, the British responded with troop rein-
forcements. A Royal Commission was sent to
investigate and its conclusions were embodied in the Peel Report, published in July 1937. Thecommissioners concluded that the Arab and
Jewish communities were irreconcilable and rec-
ommended that Palestine should be partitioned
between Arab and Jew. Partition of a small coun-try was a bitter pill for both Zionists and Arabs toswallow. The Zionists, after careful deliberation,
ﬁnally accepted partition as a solution that would
give them a small state in northern Palestine. It
was a starting point. But the Arabs rejected inde-pendence if it meant partitioning Palestine; no lessunacceptable to the Palestinian Arabs was the loss
of Jerusalem which, under the partition plan,
would have remained a British mandate.The British government accepted the report asthe basis of policy in Palestine. But it was onething to adopt a policy, quite a different matterto enforce it against strong opposition. The
Palestinian Arabs were reacting with increasing
violence, and in 1938 their revolt was renewed;
there was fighting throughout Palestine, withJewish settlements and British troops and policebeing attacked by militant Palestinian Arabs. The
British reacted ﬁercely, executing convicted Arab
terrorists and arming the Jews to defend their
outlying settlements which, in turn, strengthened
the Haganah, the Jewish secret army. The Arabrevolt continued into 1939. Despite Britain’s ﬁrmresponse in Palestine, in London the government
retreated from forcible partition against Arab
wishes. Just when the need for Jews to leave
Europe became most urgent, Britain furtherrestricted immigration into Palestine. For fiveyears Jewish immigration would be limited to75,000 and thereafter would be permitted to con-tinue only with Arab consent. The Zionists
reacted with predictable anger: the new quota
meant not only that the threatened Jews of
central Europe could not be rescued, but that theArabs would remain a large majority in an un-partitioned Palestine. British calculations were
simple: the Arabs far outnumbered the Jews in
the Middle East; in a war with Nazi Germany,
Arab friendship was important and uncertain,
while Jewish support could, it was thought, becounted on.In Palestine, British troops ﬁnally crushed theArab revolt but the Palestinian Arab political
leadership continued to protest that British policy
was too favourable to the Jews and was denyingPalestinians their independence. The SecondWorld War and the mass murder of 6 million
European Jews by Hitler’s executioners trans-

formed the Palestine question. From this searing
experience the State of Israel emerged, peopledby Jews ready to defend with their lives a countryof their own. In their eyes the injustice to the
Palestinian Arabs paled in signiﬁcance when com-
pared with the fate that had befallen European
Jews under Nazi rule in a world that had even
placed obstacles in the way of saving them andtheir brethren. Such murderous indifferencecreated a new hardness and bitterness among
Jews. The Arab cause, in the meantime, was not
helped by the attitude of the Arab political lead-
ership to the global contest. The Second WorldWar found the Arab world on the sidelines, morehostile to its British ‘protectors’ than to the Nazi
aggressors. In 1941 the Mufti became Hitler’s
ally and tool, the chosen Führer of the Arabs: a
German victory, it is clear, would have meant the
destruction of the Jews of Palestine as well. Buteven while Jews all over the world wanted theAllies to win and fought in Allied armies, Zionists
were preparing for the post-war period. Among
them were extreme nationalists ready to ﬁght not
only the Arabs but also the British rulers if nec-essary to create a Jewish nation.430THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
Military victory in 1945 sustained the illusion ofBritain’s imperial dominance a decade longer. But
the rising tide of nationalism in Turkey, Egypt
and throughout the Middle East since the 1920sshould have served as a warning signal. Now, afterthe Second World War, popular British support
for empire was rapidly ebbing away, especially
now that it could be seen to involve unacceptable
ﬁnancial burdens.Governments, both Labour and Conservative,faced a difﬁcult task defending the remaining out-posts for what were perceived as strategic or eco-
nomic reasons. The two came together in Iran.
When the war ended, the Russians were reluctant
to move out. Oil was now the lifeblood of theWest, and Britain and the US were determined toretain the Middle East as a Western preserve. In
1946 the Russians at last bowed to the pressure
on them exerted through the United Nations and
withdrew their troops.The Russians did not threaten Palestine. Butthe future of this land, with its special signiﬁcanceto great cultures and religions, was once more
heading towards bloody conﬂict. Here the Anglo-
American alliance was most strained immediately
after the war. Both Arabs and Jews claimed it astheir homeland. At the end of the war Britainfaced challenges throughout the Middle East. In
Iran and Iraq nationalism attacked foreign control
of oil resources; in Egypt it was Britain’s military
occupation of the country and its control of theSuez Canal. The ferment of the Middle East wasdue not only to struggles against foreign powersbut also to the rivalries of the Middle Eastern
nations among themselves and to the social con-
flict between the ruling elites, the emergingmiddle classes and the masses of poor. In theimmediate aftermath of the war, Britain played a
decisive role.Ernest Bevin, the British foreign secretary in theLabour government of 1945, was clear about thechoice facing his country. He resisted argumentsthat Britain’s post-war weakness would force it to
give up a dominant role in the Middle East. He
knew that Middle Eastern societies were back-
ward and feudal and that social upheavals in thelong run were likely. He was a socialist at homeand an imperialist abroad. Britain’s standard of
living was dependent on Arab oil, and what mat-
tered was the immediate future. Britain should
not, therefore, withdraw. But there was a solu-
tion: imperial dominance might be made morepalatable by creating a framework of Anglo-Arabpartnerships. If this meant partnerships with
feudal princes and kings, so be it; British inter-
ference in the internal affairs of Arab nations
would otherwise only arouse the Arab cry ofimperialism. Not everyone in the Cabinet agreed.The prime minister Clement Attlee believed that
imperialism, even when cloaked by Bevin’s pallia-
tives, would prove impossible to sustain. Would
it not be better for Britain to retire with goodwillahead of time, as it had agreed to do in India?1Chapter 39BRITAIN, ISRAEL AND THE ARABS, 1945–9
The West faced a fundamental problem in theMiddle East: how to ensure the future stability ofthe region, and how best to meet the needs and
wishes of its peoples without jeopardising the
West’s vital strategic and economic interests.In Iraq, at least, British interests appearedsecure in 1945. In the prime minister, Nuri-es-Said, London believed it had a ﬁrm pro-Western
friend. A new Anglo-Iraqi alliance treaty was con-
cluded in January 1948 which established Iraqi
control over British bases in Iraq in peacetime,
but provided for military assistance in war, whichmeant, in effect, that Britain could then reactivatethe bases. It was ironic that British socialists
should make a deal with politicians like Nuri, who
represented the interests of the wealthy landown-
ing class opposed to social reform. He had under-estimated the anti-British feelings in Iraq, whichwere whipped up into a frenzy immediately after
the conclusion of the treaty. Britain’s inﬂuence
became more precarious though it persisted for
another decade.Britain favoured agreement between the Arabstates, which was to be further enhanced by a
regional grouping. In March 1945, with Britain’s
blessing, the Arab League was founded. Despite
the yearning for greater unity in the Arab world,
however, the ruling elites were not able to provideit. Abdullah, the Hashemite ruler of Transjordan,despised the backward Egyptians. Nor was there
any love lost between the Hashemites and the rival
and victorious dynasty of Ibn Saud in Saudi
Arabia. Other Arab nationalists looked down onpoverty-stricken Transjordan as a client state inBritish pay. The Arabs were deeply split. Egypt
and Iraq eyed each other with hostility, both lay-
ing claim to leadership of the Arab world.The Arabs, including the Egyptians, had beenlargely hostile spectators during the Allied strug-gle against Germany. Although Egypt was nomi-nally independent, the British troops swarming
throughout Cairo and Alexandria, and guarding
British bases along the Suez Canal during the
war, gave every appearance of moving about in anoccupied country. The end of the war did notessentially alter the situation. The Suez Canal and
the Suez bases remained under foreign control.Meanwhile, Britain’s post-war economic plightrequired that expenditure be avoided whereverpossible. Bevin was prepared to make extensiveconcessions to Egyptian national feelings, but
insisted on ironclad treaty guarantees that the
Suez Canal would never fall into hands hostile to
Britain.In May 1946 the Attlee government acceptedthe principle of a complete military evacuation in
times of peace. Eventually in October of that year
a draft treaty was agreed against a background of
mounting Egyptian violence in the streets. Britain
undertook to withdraw its forces by September1949, but Egypt had to agree to invite the Britishback to their Suez bases and to cooperate with
Britain if any conﬂict threatened ‘against coun-
tries adjacent to Egypt’. Yet the new treaty was
never concluded; what wrecked the negotiationswas Egypt’s claim to sovereignty over the Sudan,which Britain was not ready to accept. By then,
Britain’s difﬁculties there were overshadowed by
the crisis in Palestine.Both Arab and Jew in 1945 considered thatBritish rule in Palestine was destined to end soon.The growth of both Arab and Zionist national-
ism meant that foreign rule could be maintained
only by an increasing use of force. But what form
would a Palestine state take?The Nazi slaughter of more than 6 millionJews during the Second World War, while the restof the world looked on, entirely changed Jewish
attitudes. Yet many Arabs, in their hostility to
British colonialism, had sympathised with the
Nazi rather than the Allied cause during the war.Support for Zionism and a Jewish state in1945 became overwhelming among the Jews
both of Palestine and in the rest of the world.
Never again would mass murder be permitted;
Jews were ready to ﬁght to prevent it, to create
their own nation, to guarantee the future survivalof Jews everywhere. That the creation of Israelwould involve injustice to the Arabs in Palestine
was an inevitable consequence, because the terri-
tory of a viable Jewish state would contain almost
as many Arabs as Jews. What followed between1945 and 1949 was a bloody struggle betweenthe Jews, the British and the Arabs.The British despaired of ﬁnding any solutionto which both Arabs and Jews could agree.432THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
Partition was the only practicable policy. In thelast resort the Jews would have accepted it, butthe Arabs were ready to resist it by force. Thus in
the end military arms would decide the issue; to
enforce partition Britain would have been drawn
into ﬁghting the Arabs. But its interests wereoverwhelmingly involved in maintaining goodwillwith the Arab nations. Bevin solved the dilemma
by handing responsibility over to the United
Nations. Meanwhile, as long as Britain continued
to station its troops in Palestine and to be respon-
sible for law and order and for the administration,it was exposed to both Jewish and Arab hostility.The position of the Jews in Palestine was pre-carious. They faced catastrophe if the British
should depart before they could sufficiently
mobilise to augment their own armed defenceforce, the Haganah. The Zionist leader David BenGurion tried to persuade the British to delay their
departure, appealing to Bevin as late as February
1947. He offered to root out Jewish terrorism
against the British, provided the British troopsstayed. Bevin believed that the Ben Gurion offerwas just a tactic to build up a Jewish majority
under cover of the Mandate.The acceptable face of Zionism was repre-sented by Chaim Weizmann, who more than
anyone had been responsible for securing theBalfour Declaration in 1917, and by David BenGurion; the Haganah was the tolerated armed
wing of the Jewish Agency. The Irgun, led by
Menachem Begin, who eventually became prime
minister of Israel in 1977, belonged to the unac-ceptable face of Zionism, and the Stern Groupwas even more extreme. Begin and Stern were
ready to ﬁght the British, who were (in their eyes)
accomplices of the Nazis in their failure to take
all possible steps to rescue the Jews from the
Holocaust. Begin was a Pole, a member of theEast European Jewry whose homelands hadbecome one great graveyard. In the struggle for
Israel’s survival, both the Irgun ﬁghters and all
Jews able to bear arms would be needed once the
British had left, so the breach between BenGurion and Begin could never be total.Jews of all political complexions in Palestinewere ready to help outwit the British authorities
to make it possible for the Jewish survivors, sailingin their ramshackle boats from the displaced-persons camps in Germany, to land secretly in theHoly Land. From the beaches, where men and
women were waiting for them, they were smug-
gled into the Jewish agricultural settlements – the
kibbutz. In material terms these refugees were no
great catch: penniless men, women and children,
the sick and the old predominating over the able-
bodied. For them Palestine was a haven – it was
what the ideal of a Jewish state was all about. The
‘illegal’ immigration did not always succeed; the
Royal Navy had the unenviable task of intercept-
ing and boarding the boats and forcing the
refugees to new camps in Cyprus. The seizure of
one such ship, the Exodus, led to worldwide con-demnation of Britain, especially when therefugees were shipped back to Hamburg, to the
country responsible for the Holocaust. It was a
gift for Zionist propaganda.For Britain the option of remaining inPalestine became increasingly less attractive. The
price that was being paid for the strategic base
was too high: 100,000 British troops were being
tied down in Palestine to try to keep the peace,
which they increasingly failed to accomplish.
British conscripts were being killed in raids carried
out by the Irgun and its splinter groups, the Lehi.
The Irgun’s answer to a massive military and
police action to round up suspects and disarmJewish irregulars was to blow up the King DavidHotel in Jerusalem, which housed the British
army and secretariat headquarters, on 22 July
1946. Menachem Begin later claimed that part of
the plan had been to avoid loss of life and that
sufﬁcient warning had been given by telephone.
But the time allowed between the telephone call
and the explosion was far too short; part of the
hotel collapsed and ninety-one people were killed.
An attempt was also made to plant a bomb in the
Jerusalem railway station, but this was fortunately
frustrated in time. In all, between August 1945
and September 1947, some 300 people lost their
lives as a result of terrorist action, nearly half ofthem British; seven captured Jewish terrorists hadbeen executed, two awaiting execution had com-
mitted suicide, and another thirty-seven were
killed ﬁghting. It was the manner of the loss of1BRITAIN, ISRAEL AND THE ARABS, 1945–9433
these lives as well as their actual number thatcaused such revulsion.The decision to withdraw from the thanklesstask of governing Palestine had broad British
public support. The British government was not
prepared to enforce partition on the Arabs by mil-
itary force. Nor, for all its criticisms of Britishpolicy, was the Truman administration willing todo so. The Jews were to be left to ﬁght for their
own national survival, a decision that came as no
surprise to Jewish leaders like Begin. In February
1947, the British Cabinet decided to give noticeto hand the Palestine problem to the UnitedNations by mid-May 1947. The last vain hope
was that this deadline would bring Arabs and Jews
to the conference table.The United Nations appointed a SpecialCommittee on Palestine, though it was boycottedby the Arab political leadership. In August 1947the committee reported that Palestine should be
partitioned into an Arab and a Jewish state, but
that the economic unity of Palestine should be
maintained; the committee also suggested that for another two years Britain should continue to administer Palestine under the auspices of the
United Nations and that during this transitional
period 150,000 Jews should be admitted. The
possibility that the transitional period might be
extended was also envisaged. Thus the UN com-mittee had reached much the same conclusions asthe British Peel Commission ten years earlier. Did
it stand any better chance of winning acceptance
in the face of Arab hostility? The US and the
Soviet Union, moreover, would both need to givethe UN plan their backing if sufﬁcient votes wereto be cast to provide the necessary two-thirds
majority in the General Assembly.In the event, both the US and the USSR,though the Cold War was at its height, voted infavour of the UN partition plan. Hitherto theSoviet Union had always opposed Zionism as an
ideology likely to inﬂame Jewish Soviet citizens.
One can only conjecture about the reasons for
Russia’s change of front. Possibly the Soviet lead-
ership calculated that the creation of Israel wouldundermine Western relations with the Arab statesand thus provide for the Soviet Union a means of
entering the Middle East. The American StateDepartment and the British Foreign Ofﬁce werewell aware of these dangers and were doublyanxious now that Middle Eastern oil was becom-
ing a crucial factor in Western industrial develop-
ment. They wanted to avoid a policy that was
bound to arouse Arab hostility.At this critical stage President Truman’s atti-tude was probably decisive. It was credited with
sympathies for Zionism, the electoral advantage
of appealing to the American-Jewish vote was a
bonus in supporting a UN partition plan that
would create a Jewish state. With the US and theSoviet Union organising support at the UN, therequired two-thirds majority in favour of partition
was achieved when the vote was called in the
General Assembly on 29 November 1947.The intervening months were among the worsttime for the dying British administration and theBritish troops. In a vain attempt to save Irgun ter-
rorists from execution, two British sergeants were
kidnapped by Irgun and found hanged on 31 July
1947. There was an outcry and revulsion inBritain. The British Cabinet now concluded thatBritain’s total withdrawal had become inevitable.The months between the end of November 1947and 14 May 1948, when the last British soldier left
and the State of Israel was proclaimed, were extra-ordinary. The British would not cooperate withthe UN on the partition plan and when ﬁghting
between Arabs and Jews began in December 1947
they increasingly conﬁned their authority to mili-
tary camps and police stations. The Jewish Agencyemerged as the effective Jewish government andmade desperate preparations to fight for the
Jewish state against the expected Arab assault.The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was also mobil-ising Palestinian Arabs, and sporadic fighting
broke out between Jews and Arabs. BeyondPalestine the Arab League began planning to raise‘volunteer’ armies against the day the British
departed. Their mission was to overrun the Jewish
state while it was still in its infancy. By April 1948,
even before the British had left, the Arab threatto isolate Jerusalem completely, with its largeJewish population, as well as other Jewish settle-
ments, had become very real indeed. The ﬁght-
ing spread. The Jewish leadership saw its only434THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
chance of salvation in declining to wait for thecoordinated Arab attack. In April and May theHaganah seized the initiative and undertook a
number of offensive operations. They succeeded
in checking the Arabs.The ﬁrst Arab–Israeli War created a particularproblem that was to fester and provoke unrest inthe Middle East to the present day: the Palestin-
ian refugees. In the territory assigned to Israel by
the UN in 1947 lived some 510,000 Arabs and
499,000 Jews. The majority of these Arabs ﬂed
in fear of their lives, leaving their land and pos-sessions to be taken over by the Israelis; half ofthem had already left before the British Mandate
had ended. They had genuine cause for terror;
many panicked, caught in a war between Jews and
the Arab invaders. Arab villages presented aspecial threat to the Israelis; when they supportedArab military units they were attacked. The ordi-
nary Arab, however, who had lived on the land
for generations was caught in the crossﬁre of war,
just like the Jews. Jew and Arab were exposed tothe danger of falling victim to atrocity. Irgun’s2,000 fanatical ﬁghters joined in the struggle,

cooperating with but not subordinating them-

selves to the Haganah. The most horrific of 
Israeli attacks, which were intended to intimidate
and drive out the Arabs, undertaken during the night 9 and 10 April 1948 was by the Irgun onDeir Yassin a village close to Jerusalem, where
245 men, women and children were murdered.
Though the Israeli government and the Haganah
repudiated the Irgun’s savagery, the memory of Deir Yassin stained the foundation of Israel.After Deir Yassin tens of thousands of Palestinian 
Arabs ﬂed from the territory under Israeli control
into Arab-controlled Palestine on the West 
Bank, into Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria and the
Egyptian Gaza Strip. Unable to return to Israelthese unfortunate people became pawns inMiddle Eastern politics and the seedbed for the
recruitment of militant Palestinian political, mili-
tary and terrorist organisations. The Arabs also
retaliated with terror to Deir Yassin, killingseventy-seven Jewish doctors and nurses in aconvoy on their way to Mount Scopus.The Jewish Agency, during the early weeks ofconﬂict, was desperate for arms. Once more Sovietsupport was critical. The Czechs were encouragedto transport weapons and an airlift was begunwhich delivered them just in time. In a tricky oper-

ation in April 1948 the Haganah organised a con-

voy of supplies to the 30,000 beleaguered Jews in
Jerusalem. Once the Haganah took the offensive,the disunited Arab war effort began to crumble.After David Ben Gurion had declared Israeli inde-

pendence on 14 May 1948 renewed fighting
between the various Arab forces and the Haganah
and Irgun broke out all over the country.The Jews astonished the world by winning theﬁrst round, despite their apparently hopeless posi-tion confronted by the Arab world. The Arab
armies proved less formidable than their rhetoric.
It was, nevertheless, a desperate struggle at all
points of the compass against greater numbers.The Israelis did not possess a single warplane orany heavy military equipment. But the Arab
armies of five states, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon,
Transjordan and Egypt, were totally uncoordi-
nated. Abdullah, king of Transjordan, was farmore concerned to seize the West Bank of theRiver Jordan and to add this, as well as Jerusalem,
to his kingdom than he was to destroy Israel. He
had no intention of creating an independent Arab
Palestine state. The Egyptians and Syrians too
were intent on serving their own national inter-ests. Responding vigorously and daringly theIsraelis halted the Lebanese and Syrian attack in
the north, and the attack was not pressed. Much
more serious was the advance of the Egyptian
army along the coast to Tel Aviv, which stoppedshort just a few miles from the city. The Egyptianshad also advanced to the suburbs of Jerusalem,
which was also invested by Transjordan’s British-
led and -trained Arab Legion, a ﬁrst-rate ﬁghting
force. The struggle for Jerusalem was the most
bitterly fought of the war. The Arab Legion cap-tured the Old City; despite bombarding the NewCity and causing heavy civilian casualties (1,400),
they failed to take that from the Israelis. Arab
forces also sat astride the main Jewish supply
route, the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Inone of the most celebrated episodes of the war,the Israelis managed to construct a new road to
the beleaguered city. At least part of Jerusalem
was saved for the new state.1BRITAIN, ISRAEL AND THE ARABS, 1945–9435
At the United Nations, meanwhile, a resolu-tion was approved that authorised the enforce-ment of a truce on the exhausted belligerents.
The truce came into force on 11 June 1948. Both
sides, using what turned out to be no more than
a breathing space to strengthen their militarypositions, ignored the truce provisions. A renewalof ﬁghting was regarded as certain. While the
Arabs increased their regular troops to 45,000,
the Czechs and French sent large quantities of
arms to the Israelis, including ﬁghter planes. On8 July 1948 ﬁghting resumed. The Israelis wenton the offensive; a second UN truce on the 18thwas soon broken. Count Bernadotte charged by
the UN with brokering a permanent peace, was
gunned down in Jerusalem in September, proba-
bly by a group of extremists. The Israeli govern-ment now proceeded to imprison members of theStern Group (Lehi). Israel’s lack of control over
murderous extremists had become a serious hand-
icap in its international relations at a time when
it desperately needed friends.436THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
Under the portrait of Theodor Herzl, David Ben Gurion at 4 p.m. on 14 May 1948 proclaims the State of Israel.© Robert Capa R/Magnum PhotosIn mid-October 1948 ﬁghting was once morerenewed between the Israelis and the Egyptians,who continued to hold parts of the Negev that
had been assigned to Israel by the original UN
partition plan. The ﬁghting ended in the defeat of
the Egyptians in January 1949. Egypt’s Araballies, far from helping, took advantage of the cat-astrophe. King Abdullah of Transjordan, who had
already stopped ﬁghting on 1 December 1948 
and arranged a ceaseﬁre with the Israelis, declared
the union of Palestine and Transjordan, annexed
the West Bank and henceforth called his kingdomJordan. This wily Arab ruler, alone among theArab leaders, had greatly proﬁted as regards terri-
torial expansion from the Arab–Israeli War and
drew upon himself the especial hatred of the
Egyptians. Under the auspices of the UN, Israel inthe spring of 1949 concluded armistice agree-ments with all its neighbours, Egypt, Jordan, Syria
and the Lebanon, but not with Iraq. It was not
peace, because the Arab nations would not accept
a permanent peace treaty with Israel, and the Arab refugee question continued to fester as therefugees lived mainly in makeshift camps sustained
by the UN Relief Organisation. In the aftermath
of the war, over the next decade, the centuries-old
tradition in some Muslim Middle Eastern nations
of tolerating Jewish communities in their midstwas broken. Almost half a million Jews were dri-ven out but, unlike the Arab refugees, they had a
new home waiting for them in Israel. The inﬂux
enormously strengthened Israel, which as a resultof the war had already gained considerable terri-tory in the north, part of the West Bank and landin the south. Israel’s territory had become more
integral, instead of being divided into three parts
connected only by two narrow land bridges. The
Arabs felt humiliated by the victory of the Jews,whom they saw as Western imperialist intruders,and the British as the once dominant Middle
Eastern power were blamed for the debacle. Some
600,000 Palestinian Arabs deprived of their farms
and property became penniless refugees. Hopes
for a Palestinian Arab state were thwarted, and thePalestinian Arabs nursed a burning sense of injus-tice. The Palestinian question and hatred of Israel
and Zionism also became powerful and emotive
weapons in the political struggles of the Arab
states themselves.The Arab–Israeli War also showed up the rival-ries of the Arab states and their competition for
land, leadership and inﬂuence. In the war itself
they were more intent on gaining their own
objectives than on helping each other or thePalestinian Arabs. The rivalry and bitternessbetween them was never submerged for long.
Their disunity, their general military backward-
ness and the traditions of their societies in which
the poor were exploited for the beneﬁt of the rich
landowners left them no match for an Israeli state,ardent, nationalist, modern and progressive, inwhich all Jews felt they had a stake and whose
continued strength and existence they felt was
their only guarantee against a second Holocaust.1BRITAIN, ISRAEL AND THE ARABS, 1945–9437
The victory of Israel in 1949 marked a watershedin the history of the Middle East. It laid cruelly
bare the comparative weakness of the Arab
nations and the growing strength of the new Stateof Israel. In the Arab nations the upheavals thatfollowed brought new forces to prominence.
They had been developing, however, long before
the outbreak of the war. The foundation of Israel
in the heat of war was not alone responsible. But,
within a decade of those Arab defeats, Britain’sbases of power in Egypt, Jordan and Iraq hadbeen eliminated by a renewed wave of Arab
nationalism. Western inﬂuence declined during
the Cold War for the paradoxical reason that the
Arab nations knew that the Western powerswould defend them from Soviet attack. TheMiddle East, with its vast resources of oil in the
Gulf and Saudi Arabia, was vital for Western
industry and for Japan, leaving aside the strategic
importance of the region.As the West became more dependent uponArab goodwill, so Western inﬂuence over internaldevelopments in the Middle Eastern states dimin-
ished. The monarchial Arab states did not become
more Westernised, constitutional and liberal;
indeed, there was a decisive turn to authoritarianrule by new elites, to internal suppression, policestates and torture. There was also a new urgency
to build up military and economic strength against
the twin threat of Israel and Western interference.
Israel alone remained Westernised and demo-
cratic, heavily dependent upon Western, especiallyAmerican, ﬁnancial and military support. As theUS’s only reliable anti-Soviet ally in the region,
Israel was able to follow an independent Middle
Eastern policy, frequently to the discomﬁture ofits Western allies.The Palestine war in 1949 weakened theundisputed hold of the Arab ruling classes of
landowners and politicians over the nations
created under Western tutelage after the First
World War. The old ruling elites were not over-thrown simultaneously, but were steadily sup-planted in a process that saw radical change in the
ten years after 1949 and that still has not come
to an end. A new, much more violent Arab
nationalism now swept through the Middle East.The Cold War provided added tensions as well asopportunities for the new Arab leadership to play
off West against East to extract supplies of arms
and development aid.The appeal of the new leadership lay in its callsfor a renewal of Arab national pride and for com-plete independence from the Western powers,whether Britain, France or, later, the US, even
while the Arabs beneﬁted from the Western shield
of security against the threat of Soviet territorial
expansion. The new leaders promised an accelera-tion of social change and a concern for the welfareof the poor masses, with the state playing a plan-
ning role. A new radicalism and impatience with
the corruption of the past and with the Western
imperialist connection stirred Arab society. Therewas a search for fresh solutions and frequent con-Chapter 401956CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST – SUEZﬂict about the best course to adopt. Communistssought revolutionary change, but the new rulersfeared that such a pace would sweep them away as
well. Some groups, such as the powerful Muslim
Brotherhood, insisted that the only road to Arab
salvation was to reject Western secularism alto-gether and to return to an Islamic past that wouldallow religion to embrace the whole way of life
and guide all aspects of social policy and state-
craft. Others insisted that outside help, whether
Western or Soviet, was essential for rapid progress
and that Islamic fundamentalism was an obstacleto modernisation. The emerging leadership deriv-ed its authority not from the ballot box or from
constitutional procedures, but from violent coups.
In this way the military replaced the landowners 
as the backbone of the new regimes. When theycame to power the ofﬁcers frequently had no cen-tral strategy nor any detailed policies; the coher-
ence of their programme depended on the quality
of the leadership.In Syria the repercussions of the lost war con-tributed to a military coup in March 1949. Threefurther military coups occurred during the next
three years, but it was not until 1966 that the 
secular socialist Ba’athist Party, strong in the
army, seized undisputed power, by staging yet
another coup. Neighbouring Lebanon, with itsdelicate compromises, began to fall apart when, in1958, the Christian president attempted to fore-
stall pro-Nasser and anti-Western Arab nationalist
movements (for Nasser, see p. 440). The struggle
between Christian and Muslim groups plungedthe country into confusion, and the presence ofPalestinian refugees had added a further destabil-
ising element to the kaleidoscope of the Lebanese
polity. The US threw its weight behind the
Christian president, landed marines and for a 
time an uneasy peace was maintained between the various armed factions loyal to their own lead-ers, Druze, Sunni, Shia and Christian Maronite
Falangist. The threat of civil war was not banished,
only postponed.In Jordan too the rise of Arab nationalismmade itself felt. The astute King Abdullah, whohad wanted to live peacefully with the Jews pro-
vided they would accept his rule over Palestine,
and who had then gone on to capture the WestBank and half of Jerusalem during the Palestinianwar, was assassinated by a Palestinian Arab in July1951. His successor in 1952, after a brief inter-
lude, was the young King Hussein, who managed
to retain his throne by preserving the loyalty of 
the army and – despite Jordan’s continued ﬁnan-cial and military dependence on Britain – severingtreaty ties with the British, so asserting Jordanian
independence. Saudi Arabia, still feudal, still disci-
plined by a fundamentalist Islamic tradition re-
mains the only major Arab nation apart from
Jordan where the monarchy has survived into thelast quarter of the twentieth century.In Iraq, King Faisal II and the most powerfulpolitician in the country, Nuri-es-Said, seemed to
guarantee a ﬁrmly pro-Western conservative gov-
ernment, but Arab nationalism in Iraq in 1948already limited the conservatives’ freedom ofaction. There was no open break with Britain, but
even Nuri-es-Said could not afford to identify
himself too closely with the West. The Arab
League, of which Iraq was a leading member, alsocontained Egypt, which disputed with Iraq theleadership of the Arab peoples. Policies of reform
and development were too slow in Iraq; the
landowners and conservative politicians had no
wish to promote radical change, so Nasser’s
Egyptian revolution proved a serious threat to the‘old gang’ in Iraq. In 1958 the Iraqi army led abloody revolution. It came as a shock to the West,
not least because of the brutal murders of Faisal
and Nuri-es-Said. The alliance with the West was
discarded.In neighbouring Iran, after the Second WorldWar, a groundswell of discontent threatened to
oust the Shah and the conservative politicians
from power. The withdrawal of the Russians and
the provision of US advice and aid had not solved
the inherent problems of Iranian society. A wide-spread rejection of foreign influence, bothAmerican and British, was just one indication of
the growth of nationalism. The technologically
advanced Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was the
most visible sign of foreign exploitation, andthough it provided much of the state’s revenue itemployed only a very small proportion of the
Iranian working population. Despite the develop-
ment of the oil industry, Iran was still one of the11956: CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST – SUEZ439
most backward Middle Eastern nations and thepeasant masses were sunk in poverty. Urbandevelopment, especially the growth of Teheran,
expanded the number of artisans and shopkeep-
ers at the bottom of the social scale, who formed,
with a burgeoning bureaucracy, a disparate lower-middle class. But it was students who became thespearhead of revolutionary and nationalist senti-
ment, aided by a backlash of Islamic fundamen-
talism against modern Western ways and their
accompanying corruption and secularism.In the spring of 1951 the Shah’s political controlwas loosened when opposition pressure forced
him to appoint as prime minister a veteran, radical
politician called Mohammed Mossadeq. With the
struggle focusing on foreign inﬂuence – of whichthe most potent symbol was the Anglo-IranianOil Company – Mossadeq put himself at the head
of the nationalist movement. Control of oil sup-
plies had become the vital new factor in the
region’s politics. In the ﬁve years following thewar the production of crude oil was doubled from250 million tons to 500 million; by 1960 pro-
duction reached 1,000 million tons. The West’s
demand for oil seemed insatiable, output reach-
ing 2,000 million tons in 1968. By far the largest
producer was Saudi Arabia, which also had thelargest reserves.Britain’s position in the Middle East seemedseriously threatened when in May 1951 the
largest oil reﬁnery in the world, at Abadan, and
all other installations of the Anglo-Iranian OilCompany were peremptorily expropriated andnationalised by Mossadeq. Anti-British rioting
heightened the tension. The British Labour gov-
ernment considered using force to protect the
valuable British investment, but the prime 
minister, Clement Attlee, wisely chose to workwith the Americans and the United Nations toachieve a peaceful settlement. A nation could not
be prevented from taking charge of its resources;
the oil companies, moreover, had not paid a fair
price for the oil that they had been extracting.Pressure to settle was put on the Iranians byBritain and the US, with British technicians with-
drawing from Abadan and bringing the reﬁnery
to a halt.But the most important lesson learnt by the oil-producing countries was that possession of theresources and installations did not give them com-

plete control. Since the oil-producers had to
export the bulk of the oil to the West, the inter-

national companies continued, through their mar-
keting facilities and outlets, to exert great inﬂu-
ence. Thus in 1951 the Americans cooperated with
Britain to block the sale of oil produced by the
national Iranian oil company. Mossadeq’s moves,
at ﬁrst applauded, plunged Iran into economic dif-

ﬁculties and his political supporters began to ﬁght
each other. In August 1953, the Shah staged acoup to recover the powers he had lost, with
strong support from America’s Central Intelli-
gence Agency and Britain’s intelligence services. 
In the following year, the oil dispute was settled.For the next twenty-ﬁve years, until 1979, theShah’s authoritarian rule, with American support,
appeared to provide the West with a secure ally.Far-reaching in its consequences for the whole ofthe Middle East was the Egyptian revolution of1952, which produced the dominant Arab leader
of the 1950s and 1960s, Gamal Abdel Nasser.
Defeat in Palestine had not immediately brought
about the fall of King Farouk: there were plenty
of other fuses besides Palestine that led to revo-lution. The inequitable distribution of land, madeworse by a rapidly increasing peasant population,
meant that living standards for the mass of under-
privileged Egyptians were falling, not rising. The
luxury and corruption of the Palace came to besymbolised by the figure of the gross KingFarouk. Worse, the politicians and the king had
failed to remove the British troops from the Suez
Canal Zone. The last Palestine war was seen as
the latest indication of the inability of Egyptian
rulers to stand up to foreign, imperialist inﬂuence.The Wafd Party had also, by this time, becomeidentiﬁed with weakness and corruption. A Wafd
government in 1951 tried to deprive the British
of any right to remain in the Suez bases by uni-
laterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of1936. All that this gesture demonstrated was thecontinued helplessness of the Egyptians.Guerrilla attacks were launched on the Britishin their bases and were answered by British440THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
counter-attacks that culminated in a British as-sault on the Egyptian police headquarters inIsmailia. Forty-one policemen were killed in the
battle that followed, martyrs of the Egyptian
nationalist cause. With nationalist feeling aroused
to a frenzy, Cairo was burnt and looted by mobsof angry Egyptians. Within Egypt, the only force,other than the British, able to restore order was
the Egyptian army. The politicians had lost
control and the army leadership now held the key
to the future of Egypt. Farouk had long since
become a spent force.Inside the army a nationalist group of middle-ranking and younger ofﬁcers conspired to seize
power to provide Egypt with new leadership.
Calling themselves the Free Ofﬁcers, they were
led by Lieutenant-Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser.To provide a figurehead among the generals,General Neguib was won over to the conspiracy,
but most of the senior military commanders
remained loyal to the king.Farouk believed he could rely on the army andunderestimated the conspirators. They seizedpower in a bloodless coup in July 1952. The old
order had collapsed without a ﬁght. Farouk was
allowed to depart on his luxury yacht into exile.
It was a revolution from above without any really
popular participation. But there was no lamentover Farouk and the departed politicians either.They had made too many enemies among inﬂu-
ential groups, including the powerful Muslim
Brotherhood, to be able to offer any effective
resistance. Nor did the British see any reason fordefending Farouk, who had so recently turnedviolently on the British presence in Egypt. They
adopted a wait-and-see approach. There was no
rioting in Cairo and the people evidently accepted
the transfer of power.The revolutionary colonels purged the army of the senior ofﬁcers who had remained loyal toFarouk. Beyond this the Free Ofﬁcers had no
constructive plans for a new society or state. 
They knew, however, what they wished to end:
the monarchy and corruption, British imperialismand Egypt’s military weakness. When GeneralNeguib sought real power, Nasser ousted him in
the spring of 1954 and became Egypt’s sole
authoritarian leader. The Muslim Brotherhood,however, and the Wafd, both of which could stillcommand popular mass support, stood in his way. They had taken the side of Neguib, so
Nasser now marked them down for suppression.
His own support, he noted, had come from 
the army and from the poor. Socialism, with itspromises, appealed to the masses, and Nasserrealised that by espousing it he would strengthen
his popular base. He had come to power with 
no ready-made ideology; the two characteristic
features of his regime, socialism and pan-Arabism,
were only gradually developed and adopted.Fundamentally, however, it remained a militarydictatorship which won mass support from the
Egyptian people. It relied heavily on his personal
charisma.Was there a clear division in the mid-twentiethcentury between those countries that used force
to get their way and those that accepted inter-
national standards and took their obligations
under the Charter of the United Nations seri-ously? The Suez Crisis and the Hungarian ris-ing occurring at the same time in November
1956, should have demonstrated to the world
that contrast in the international behaviour of the
powerful when confronting the weak. But it did
not, at least to begin with. Yet it was British scru-ples, the wish to appear to be acting with righton its side, which ensured the failure of the
Anglo-French attack on Egypt. The ﬁgleaf of rec-
titude with which the ingenious French had
attempted to cover the aggression proved tootransparent. There was an outcry in Britain andthe government lost the necessary backing of a
deeply divided electorate at home. Without that
backing a democratic country could not for long
wage a distant war. In the end the free world did
not behave as the Soviets were doing in Hungary,and for one reason: the most powerful democ-racy, the US, compelled Britain and France to
withdraw and to accept the will of the United
Nations, whereas Soviet control over Hungary
after the brutal repression was allowed to endure.None of the countries involved, Egypt, Israel,Britain, the US, France and the other Arab
nations, followed clear and consistent policies
from the beginnings of negotiations in 1954 to11956: CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST – SUEZ441
the invasion in November 1956. That makes ithard sometimes to distinguish the wood from thetrees and from the tangle of undergrowth.For Nasser and the Egyptians the desire to enda semi-colonial status and subservience to Britain
took ﬁrst place. British troops stationed in theSuez Canal Zone were an army of occupation onEgyptian soil. The Canal Company, with its head-
quarters in Paris, was alien too. It managed and
organised the passage of ships through the Canal
thousands of miles distant. No wonder that in the
mid-twentieth century Egyptians saw the Com-pany and its protectors as the successors of theimperialists who had ﬁrst occupied Egypt in the
1880s. The Egyptians were regarded as backward
by Westerners, incapable of running the Canal
effectively by themselves. All this was deeplyhumiliating to nationalists in Egypt. Moreover,Egypt was still smarting from its defeat by Israel.
As most Israelis had come from Europe in recent
times they too were regarded as Westerners and
Zionism as another facet of imperialism. They haddisplaced hundreds of thousands of PalestinianArabs during the war for Israeli independence.
Now these Arabs were refugees in their own part
of the world. Not that Colonel Nasser or any of
the Arab leaders were much bothered about
Palestinian Arabs. But Nasser’s credentials as apan-Arab leader depended on espousing the Arabcause and proclaiming his enmity to the Zionist
intruders.Nasser knew that Egypt was militarily weak buthe did have some cards to play. The Suez Canalhad been constructed by Ferdinand, Vicomte deLesseps in the typical imperialist manner of the
nineteenth century. Ruthless and brilliant, de
Lesseps had set up the Suez Canal Company and
had plundered the Egyptian treasury, while the
Egyptians had supplied 20,000 forced labourers.Construction began in 1859 and was completedin 1869. When the khedive went bankrupt he
sold the Egyptian shareholding in the Canal to
Britain for a mere £4 million in the famous ﬁnan-
cial coup masterminded by the Rothschilds forDisraeli. The Canal Company, with its British andFrench shareholders, did not actually own the
Canal; the territory through which the canal was
constructed remained under Ottoman sover-eignty. The Company had merely acquired a con-cession to operate the Canal for ninety-nine yearsafter its opening. Thus it would end in November
1968. That gave Nasser a legal claim. Was he pre-
pared to wait? For France and Britain time was
running out.The Zone through which the Canal ran waseffectively controlled by British troops. Under the
Constantinople Convention of 1888 the Canal
was to be ‘free and open in time of war as in
peace’. The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 was
supposed to give Egypt real independence andwas indeed a step towards it. But Britain extractedas the price the right to continue to occupy the
Canal Zone for twenty years and even to reoc-
cupy the rest of Egypt if necessary in the event of
war. Britain made use of this right during theSecond World War.The time for renegotiating the alliance, then,was rapidly approaching in the 1950s. And here
was the quandary for the West: in the era of Cold
War antagonism, to concede completely equalrights in the Suez Canal to all countries, asrequired by the Convention of 1888, could allow
the Soviet Union to secure a foothold. That was
unthinkable as far as London and Washington
were concerned. There was a way out, the solution
the West had found for that other crucial inter-
national ‘canal’, the Straits of Constantinople.There was one exception to the requirement for
free passage of international canals. The sovereign
power through which the canal ran could take any
measures it felt necessary for its defence. By tyingTurkey into the NATO alliance the Soviets couldbe kept out. So, if Egypt could be induced to con-

tinue the Western alliance, the Soviet Union would
be denied any inﬂuence. The situation would of
course be catastrophically reversed if Egypt con-

cluded an alliance with the Soviet Union!The Cold War and the fear of Soviet penetra-tion of the Middle East provide the key to an
understanding of Washington’s and London’s
policies in the early negotiations with Nasser.
Anthony Eden, foreign secretary in Churchill’sgovernment, worked hard to secure a friendlyagreement with Nasser over the issues outstand-
ing between Britain and Egypt, and he was
backed by the US secretary of state John Foster442THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
Dulles. There was an additional issue of the futureof the Sudan, hitherto under dual Anglo-Egyptian authority. In February 1953 agreement
was reached that the Sudanese should decide their
own future. To Nasser’s surprise they opted not
for union with Egypt but for independence. Thefollowing year Nasser was more successful. InOctober 1954 a new Anglo-Egyptian treaty was
concluded which provided for the complete evac-
uation of all British troops from the Suez bases
within twenty months. The bases were to be
mothballed. This compromise formula wouldallow Britain to reactivate the bases should warbreak out in the region. The treaty was to run for
seven years until 1961. The British chiefs of staff
calculated they would not need a Suez base after
1961 anyway. Nonetheless, with the Suez Canalstill foreign-owned and foreign-run, it was lessthan immediate complete freedom for Egypt. The
Muslim Brotherhood denounced Nasser’s agree-
ment with Britain as treachery, while in London
Eden was accused by right-wing Conservatives of‘scuttling from the Canal Zone’. Eden had madeconsiderable concessions on Britain’s behalf and
had taken a risk with his popularity at home,
which made him later all the more sensitive to the
charge of appeasing the Egyptian dictatorship.Britain, together with France and the US, claimedthe right to exercise a major role in ensuring that
stability should be preserved throughout the
Middle East. During the years immediately fol-
lowing the signature of the armistice betweenEgypt, Israel and the other Arab states in 1949 anuneasy peace prevailed. But the Arabs refused to
accept that Palestine had disappeared, its territory
partitioned between the new sovereign State of
Israel and an enlarged Jordan. The armistice could
not be turned into a permanent peace. To stop theoutbreak of another war the US, Britain andFrance, by their Tripartite Declaration on 25 May
1950, sought to regulate the arms supplied to
Israel and its Arab neighbours; and they appointed
themselves policemen in the Arab–Israeli conﬂict,stating that:should they ﬁnd that any of these States waspreparing to violate frontiers or armistice lines,[the three powers] would, consistently withtheir obligations as members of the UnitedNations, immediately take action, both within
and outside the United Nations, to prevent
such violation.The Arab states and Israel were not a party to thistreaty nor was the Soviet Union invited to join it.
By leaving out the Russians, the unregulated
supply of arms from the Eastern bloc led to the
very arms race the West had tried to prevent.The Declaration, with its assumption of greatpower overlordship, was more impressive onpaper than in actuality. Britain, France and the
US were uneasy partners. The US believed, not
unjustly, that Britain had still not abandoned its
old colonial attitudes, which would alienate theArab nations. The British, for their part, resentedthe growth of American inﬂuence and the way in
which the US was diminishing Britain’s commer-
cial stake. Although France was to cooperate with
Britain in the mid-1950s at the time of the SuezCrisis, cooperation was based on considerations of Realpolitik. Had not the British ruthlesslydestroyed France’s empire in the Lebanon and
Syria at the end of the Second World War? The
purpose of France’s continued involvement in the
Middle East was at least to retain, and if possibleto expand, its shrunken inﬂuence in North Africaafter the military debacle in Indo-China. The
most critical struggle of all was being waged in
Algeria, which the French declared to be an indi-
visible part of France. Nasser’s propaganda sup-ported the Algerian rebels, and the tension wasraised still further because the French were over-
estimating the quantity of weapons Nasser was
able to send to the Algerian nationalists.The US too faced a dilemma. Britain andFrance were its most important Western allies butAmerica also wished to be regarded as the friendof independent Arab nations; it saw itself as being
free from the colonialist taint and condemned the
old British and French attitudes. How to side
with Arab nationalism as well as with Britain andFrance? There was no reconciling such a contra-diction six years later during the Suez Crisis of
1956. In strengthening US economic power in
the region through the oil giants, its disinterested11956: CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST – SUEZ443
friendship had in any case carried little conviction.America’s opposition to social revolution – anyform of socialism being regarded as little differ-
ent from communism – meant that US support
was given to kings, princes and feudal minorities,
the ‘old gang’, thus making anti-Americanism anappealing slogan with which the political opposi-tion in the Middle Eastern states could arouse the
masses. British governments, whether Labour or
Conservative, took a similar line to the Americans
and had done so for much longer, allying them-
selves with the feudal leaders of the Arab peoplesand failing to change course after the SecondWorld War. For these Arab monarchs and their
ministers the West became an essential pillar of
support against their own peoples in opposition.
But it exposed them to accusations of betrayingArab independence for the sake of maintainingtheir corrupt regimes. That their accusers could
be just as corrupt did not lessen the power of their
propaganda.Still, in 1954 it seemed that Anglo-Egyptianrelations, and so Western inﬂuence, had been rea-sonably secured. But the Middle East in the after-
math of the Arab–Israeli War was an unstable
region. Regional conﬂicts and hostilities might
yet undermine the West. To promote a general
peace in the Middle East was therefore the otherside of the coin to the Cold War objective ofkeeping the Russians out.The Arab refusal to accept Israel meant that nopeace treaties were concluded between it and its
Arab neighbours. The Arab states continued pub-licly to declare that they would attack and destroyIsrael. In reality Nasser was seeking a peaceful
solution from 1952 until February 1955, and
secret, high-level Israeli–Egyptian negotiations
were held but they led to no settlement. Britain,
France and the US had meanwhile stepped in asguarantors of the frontiers.Making friends with Nasser, though, was notgoing to be easy. There was another bone of con-
tention. Nasser’s bid for revolutionary pan-Arab
leadership was opposed by the feudal, oil-richrulers of Saudi Arabia and the sheikhs of the Gulfstates. They in turn had the backing of the US
and Britain. Nasser’s ambitions were also opposed
by the kingdom of Iraq, whose pro-Western gov-ernment had just concluded the military BaghdadPact as a Turkish–Arab–Western-backed barrieragainst Soviet penetration. The Arab world in the
mid-1950s was thus rent by the bitter rivalry and
antagonism between Egypt and Iraq. In trying to
be friends with both sides, Britain was attempt-ing to ride two horses at once.The Anglo-American Middle Eastern peaceproject was a secret effort known by the code-
name Alpha. In the very month that the Baghdad
Pact was signed between Iraq and Turkey, in
February 1955, Eden flew to Cairo to meetNasser. The Egyptian leader left him in no doubtabout his hostility towards the Pact but appeared
more moderate on the Palestine issue, even dis-
cussing the possibility of peace with Israel. This
gave some hope for Alpha, had it not been forthe militant Palestinians. The Palestinian guerril-las, known as the fedayeen, had in 1953 begun
conducting raids into Israel from Egyptian-held
Gaza and the Jordanian West Bank. The Israelis
responded with massive reprisal raids which theyhoped would deter the countries hosting Pales-tinian fighters from allowing incursions into
Israel. One such Israeli reprisal in October 1953
had destroyed much of the Jordanian village of
Qibya; more than ﬁfty men, women and children
lost their lives in the attack. There were further,though less savage, reprisals against Jordan in1954. Why then did the Palestinians continue
their attacks? Their leader, Yasser Arafat, calcu-
lated that provoking Israeli strikes inside Jordan
and Egypt would prove counter-productive forthe Israelis: Jordan might not be able to strikeback but Egypt could. The Israelis fell into the
trap. A Palestinian raid from the Gaza Strip led
to an Israeli counter-blow on 28 February 1955
in which sixty-nine mainly Egyptian soldiers 
and Palestinians were killed or wounded. Thisbrought to an end the direct contacts betweenIsrael and Egypt in pursuit of a peaceful solution
of their differences. Nasser could not accept such
a humiliation. Egypt’s priority now was to
increase its military strength to enable it to con-front Israel at least on equal terms in the future.Nasser wanted a huge quantity of arms. He would
get them from the West if he could; if he could
not, he would get them from the East.444THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
The prospects for Alpha had been reduced, ifnot extinguished. There was further desultory talkof a settlement with Israel, but Nasser insisted
that Jordan should be given the Israeli Negev and
that the new frontier should run across to Gaza.
Then Jordan and Egypt would share a commonfrontier – and Egypt, as the stronger country,would have dominated Jordan. Such a proposal
had no chance of acceptance.In April 1955 Churchill retired and Edenbecame prime minister. With a small inner
Cabinet of ministers, Eden dominated the foreignpolicy of his administration. During the summerof 1955 he and Dulles were still hoping to woo
Nasser. His request for arms, however, ran into
difﬁculties in Washington. Khrushchev saw his
chance to vault the Baghdad Pact barrier andtrumped anything Nasser could hope to securefrom the West with an offer of planes and tanks
on terms the Egyptian would ﬁnd hard to refuse.
That October the arms deal with the Soviet
Union was publicly conﬁrmed.The dismay in London and Washington wasnothing compared to the alarm felt in Israel. In
November Prime Minister Ben Gurion started to
plan for war. Israel’s geographical position made
it extremely vulnerable; a mere fifteen-mile
advance by an enemy would have cut the countryin half. What is more, the combined populationsof its Arab neighbours dwarfed Israel’s. Unlike
those neighbours, Israel had to draw on all of its
manpower to wage war, but it could not do so
for long without facing ruin at home. This deter-mined Israeli strategy. The war had to be carrieddeep into enemy territory and to maximise the
chances of success the enemy had to be caught
off-balance. In such a mortal combat the Israelis
were not concerned with legalistic arguments
over who had technically started the war. As Israelinterpreted it, the huge build-up of Egyptian armsmeant that an Arab attack was only a matter of
time. But who could Israel rely on for help?
Western supplies of arms were controlled by the
Tripartite Declaration of May 1950, yet theSoviet Union and Nasser had driven a coach andhorses through it. In the winter of 1955, the
French began supplying arms to Israel, including
their superb Mystère IV ﬁghters. It was the startof a more intimate relationship between Israel andFrance, left in the cold by Britain and the US.Eden and Dulles had not, however, given uphope that autumn and winter of pulling Nasser
back from the Soviet orbit. Nasser’s great ambition
was to transform the economy of Egypt and heplanned to do so by means of a huge new HighDam at Aswan that would supply electric power
and irrigation for the Upper Nile. The ﬁnance

needed was to be provided by the World Bank, on
condition that the US and Britain contributed as
well. Eden urged Dulles to support the deal inorder to avoid a Soviet–Egyptian ﬁnancial arrange-
ment. An offer by Britain and the US to ﬁnance the

ﬁrst stage was actually made in December 1955.
There was at this point no British alignment with
France, let alone with Israel – support for Israelwould have alienated the very friends Britain andthe US wanted to make among the Arab states.Yet within a few months the situation hadtotally changed. Britain and the US increasingly
suspected each other’s policies and their cooper-ation came to an end. Britain instead, with muchhesitation, forged an alliance with France and
Israel, and was drawn into a secret plan to defeat
Egypt and topple Nasser. What had brought
about such an extraordinary upheaval, above all
in British aims?By March 1956, Nasser was seen by Eden as adanger to British interests in the Middle East, an
unreliable leader deeply committed to the Soviet
Union. Cairo’s propaganda against Britain’s Arab
friends, especially against Britain’s inﬂuence in
Jordan, and Egypt’s hostility to the inclusion ofJordan within the Baghdad Pact sparked off the
breach. Jordan’s King Hussein was too weak to
resist the pro-Nasser sentiment that swept
through his country. Bowing to pressure, on 1
March 1956 he dismissed the British officer,known as Glubb Pasha, who commanded Jordan’sArab Legion. Eden reacted angrily: it seemed to
him that Nasser was intent upon undermining
Britain in the Middle East. From then on Eden
was determined by one means or another to ridthe Middle East of Nasser.In April 1956 Dulles and Eden agreed to letthe Aswan loan negotiations languish. Nasser was
now no longer seen as a possible supporter of the11956: CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST – SUEZ445
West. Britain’s and America’s withdrawal was for-mally announced by Dulles on 19 July 1956.That Congress would vote the necessary money
to part-ﬁnance Nasser’s dam with the World Bank
was by now inconceivable. But the abrupt manner
of the announcement unnecessarily and probablyunintentionally increased the snub to Nasser, whocould not meekly accept such a setback. His next
move should not have come as such a surprise.
On 26 July, in a dramatic speech in Alexandria,
Nasser declared that Egypt had nationalised the
Suez Canal Company, thus ending Westerncontrol twelve years ahead of the expiry date ofthe Suez concession. Overnight he became the
hero of the Arab world. He was not acting unlaw-
fully, however, as he offered to compensate the
Company’s shareholders. Nasser had turned thetables on Britain and the US. At ﬁrst this was not appreciated. With what was still a common
Western arrogance, it was widely believed that the
Egyptians would not be able to manage the Canal
once the European pilots and technicians werewithdrawn. It came as a shock therefore when theEgyptians, with help from Eastern communist
friends, demonstrated that ships would continue
to pass through the Canal without difﬁculty.For Eden, Nasser’s behaviour, little more than amonth after the last British troops had left theCanal in compliance with the 1954 Treaty, was 
a personal humiliation that exposed him to a
renewed attack from the Conservative right.
Moreover, with two-thirds of Western Europe’soil passing through the Canal, Eden believed thatNasser’s control of it would give him a strangle-
hold on the economies of Britain and Western
Europe, or as Eden graphically put it, the
Egyptian dictator ‘would have his hands on our
windpipe’. If Nasser was allowed to get away withit, Eden concluded, there would be no stoppinghim from trampling over other British interests.
Personal anguish, an exaggeration of the threat to
Britain, and ill health all combined to drive Eden
forward (albeit with Cabinet support) into an ill-considered international adventure.The decision in London to prepare a militaryoption had been taken by the British Cabinet on
27 July, a day after Nasser’s speech nationalisingthe Suez Canal. There was agreement that, if allelse failed, Egypt would be attacked and forced toaccept an international agreement ensuring free
passage of the Suez Canal not merely until the
Suez Canal Company’s concession ran out in
November 1968, but in perpetuity. The Egyp-tians, it was assumed, were not capable of manag-ing and running the Canal by themselves or of
assuring that international agreements would be
observed. The Cabinet accordingly instructed the
British chiefs of staff to prepare a war plan. As yet,
no real thought was given to coordinating militaryand diplomatic moves with France. That camelater in mid-August. As for Israel, Eden insisted
that it be kept out of the conﬂict so that Britain’s
Arab friends would not be antagonised. An inner
Cabinet committee of six, including the chan-cellor of the exchequer Harold Macmillan, was set up to manage the crisis. The US at this stage 
in late July was kept in touch. Eden cabled to
President Eisenhower that Britain could not
afford to let Nasser win. There was, he stressed, aneed for a ﬁrm stand by all maritime countriesbecause, if Nasser were not stopped, ‘our inﬂu-
ence throughout the Middle East will, we are con-
vinced, be ﬁnally destroyed’. In the last resort
Britain would use force, and he added, ‘I have this
morning instructed our Chiefs of Staff to preparea military plan accordingly.’ He asked for anAmerican representative to come to London to
help coordinate policy. While Eden expected to be
working with the Americans, the French, who
were even more determined to topple Nasser thanthe British, offered to place their forces under aBritish commander. Not only was the nationalisa-
tion of the predominantly French-owned Suez
Canal Company an affront to France’s inter-

national standing, but Nasser as the champion and
hero of the Arab world was undermining theFrench hold over Algeria. Nasser’s open supportfor the Front de Libération Nationale with propa-
ganda and arms was rated so serious in its effect
that it could swing the balance against France in
the Algerian struggle. The French worked hard toforge a military alliance with Britain, but fearedthat Eden might in the end continue to work with
Dulles and adopt the American policy of seeking a
negotiated settlement.446THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
If Britain would not act with France to destroyNasser, was there an alternative? The Frenchchiefs thought so – a military alliance with Israel.
But an alliance with Britain was preferable and
they would have to be careful not to jeopardise
that by premature discussions with Israel. So theFrench prime minister Guy Mollet and his foreignminister François Pineau had a difﬁcult game to
play. Discussions with the Israelis would have to
be held secretly at arm’s length from the joint
military planning with Britain. The Israeli prime
minister was deeply suspicious of Eden’s pro-Arabpolicies and had little faith in British reliability.Thus Eden’s opposition to any Israeli involve-
ment was reciprocated by Israeli doubts about the
wisdom of acting with Britain.Before the French were ready to start militaryconversations with the Israelis, their priority wasto coordinate Anglo-French military planning.
This did not happen until mid-August 1956.
Eden by then was following a two-track policy:
military preparations would be pushed ahead atthe same time as international negotiationsbetween the maritime nations and Egypt.It was the US secretary of state John FosterDulles who took the lead in the effort to diffuse
the Canal Crisis by conference diplomacy. He and
President Eisenhower also found themselves in adifficult position. Britain was America’s mostimportant ally in the Cold War. But Eisenhower
suspected Conservative-led Britain of lapsing into
colonial attitudes. To make war on Egypt was
legally and morally unjustified, would not besanctioned by the UN and would, so Eisenhowerbelieved, turn the whole Arab world against the
West. The attempt to assure Britain of friendly
support while also trying to restrain it produced
much ambiguity in what the US would or would
not sanction. A conference was convened inLondon from 16 to 23 August 1956, with Indiaand the Soviet Union participating. Nasser
rejected the two proposals that were the outcome
of the London Conference as infringing Egypt’s
sovereign rights. Nor did the proposals made bya second conference convened in London on 21September ﬁnd any more favour in Cairo. Britain
and France then took their dispute to the Security
Council of the United Nations early in October.Nasser seemed to be playing for time, in the mis-taken belief that the longer it took the less likelywas any military aggression by Britain and France.
Dulles and Eisenhower, however, continued 
to urge restraint and patience and to seek new
solutions.Military plans for Operation Musketeer, theassault on Egypt, were proceeding apace, but they
had to be revised constantly for military and diplo-
matic reasons. It took time to marshal sufﬁcient
aircraft and paratroops in Cyprus and to assemble
troops there and in Malta, who were to be ferriedby the Mediterranean ﬂeet to Port Said. DuringAugust and September the one clear development
was that Eden learnt that the Americans would
not actively support the use of force. So he
switched to France. But, although Britain andFrance were in close partnership militarily, thatdid not extend to their diplomatic aims in the
Middle East beyond Egypt. There they were
almost on opposite sides: France was supporting
Israel; Britain was supporting the Arab states, andit conﬁrmed the full validity of its alliance withJordan against Israel when Jordan became the vic-
tim of two Israeli reprisal raids in September 1956.
One of the most extraordinary aspects of the Suez
Crisis is how late British policy changed, only days
before the attack on Egypt: Eden abruptly agreedto make use of Israel in a plan to legitimise theassault on Egypt. But until that change took place,
the French had to keep the Israeli connection
secret from their British ally.During the latter part of September theFrench, with diplomatic ﬁnesse, began involvingthe Israelis and the British in a secret game plan
for war on Egypt. When Eden and his foreign
Secretary Selwyn Lloyd visited Paris for talks with
Mollet and Pineau on 26 September it is possible
that the French revealed that they were havingcontacts with the Israelis. The French aim was forthe Canal to be threatened with closure because
Israel had attacked Egypt and was advancing
towards Suez – would not Britain and France
then be justiﬁed, in the interests of keeping theSuez Canal open to international trafﬁc, in actingas policemen, demanding that both sides with-
draw from the Suez Canal and occupying it if
either the Israelis or the Egyptians rejected the11956: CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST – SUEZ447
demand? Given its fears of Egyptian rearmament,Israel might well make a pre-emptive attack onEgypt, and in that event the British and French
could justify military intervention to keep the
combatants apart and at a distance from the
Canal.An Israeli delegation led by the redoubtableGolda Meir arrived in Paris and went into secret
talks on 30 September and 1 October. Mollet and
Pineau outlined their scheme. For the Israelis a
war with Egypt might determine their country’s
future existence, yet relations with Britain after theIsraeli raids into Jordan had sunk to a new low.Indeed, since the days of the Mandate, Britain had
not been held in high esteem in Israel nor
regarded as trustworthy. What if Jordan joined in
on the Egyptian–Israeli war? Golda Meir wantedto know on whose side Britain would then ﬁght.Pineau did his best to persuade the Israelis that
Britain’s priority would be the defeat of Egypt but
he went on to explain that the British government
needed a pretext to attack Egypt.The ﬁrst two weeks of October were decisive.At the beginning of the month Eden was still
undecided, the chancellor of the exchequer
Harold Macmillan was a hawk and the foreign
secretary Selwyn Lloyd a dove. Under the aegis
of the United Nations, Selwyn Lloyd was in NewYork trying to negotiate a settlement of the Canalproblem directly with Mahmoud Fawzi, the
Egyptian foreign minister. Pineau, the French
foreign minister, who was also involved, was far
less keen on a peaceful outcome. On 12 Octoberthey ﬁnally reached an agreement based on ‘sixprinciples’, and the UN Security Council
endorsed them. Eden cabled Selwyn Lloyd at
lunchtime on 14 October that he was ready to
negotiate further with the Egyptians and those
members of the Security Council anxious to seethe issue peacefully resolved.The possibility of joint Anglo-French militaryaction seemed to have receded, though to main-
tain pressure on Egypt Eden reserved Britain’s
rights to use force if the Egyptians did not accepta satisfactory settlement. But later that afternoonEden received two envoys from Paris. The French
prime minister wanted to know what Britain
would do if Israel attacked Egypt. The TripartiteDeclaration of 1950 had promised US, Britishand French help to the victim of aggression,though the French pointed out that Nasser had
recently repudiated its application to Egypt. The
French then revealed the plan they had discussed
with the Israelis on 30 September and 1 October:Israel would attack Egypt and, on the pretext of separating the combatants and safeguarding
the Canal, a French and British force would
invade Egypt and occupy the Canal Zone. Eden
promised to reply by 16 October but was clearly
attracted to the scheme.Eden saw the French proposal as a possibleescape from mounting difficulties. War was
drawing closer in the Middle East and Britain
would not be able to keep out of it. Jordan was
in crisis. On 10 October, that is four days beforethese crucial Anglo-French conversations inLondon, in a massive reprisal raid on Qalquilya,
which marked the climax of Israeli–Jordanian
clashes, over seventy Jordanians were killed. The
Israelis were trying to foil an agreement betweenIraq and Jordan, backed by Britain, to bring Iraqitroops to the help of the Jordanians. Where did
Britain stand? Its credibility in the Arab Middle
East and its strengthening of the Baghdad Pact
now depended on it honouring the defensive
alliance concluded with Jordan. Thus Britainlooked like being dragged in against Israel and onthe side of the Arab states if war broke out
between Israel on the one hand and Jordan and
Egypt on the other. This involvement in the
general Arab enmity towards Israel now cut rightacross Britain’s own conﬂict with Egypt. France,moreover was backing Israel. No wonder Selwyn
Lloyd thought that any outbreak of war would be
a disaster for Britain.While French and Israeli military staffs workedon plans to attack Egypt, Eden now made up hismind that the best way out was to accept theFrench plan of Anglo-French military action in
collusion with Israel. As part of this plan he could
ensure that Israel would not attack Jordan, and
so save Britain from the dilemma of defending it.Time was now running out: military plans couldnot be for ever revised and postponed without
demoralising British forces being readied for the
attack. On 16 October Eden and Lloyd returned448THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
to Paris to consult further with Mollet andPineau. The ‘contingency’ of an Israeli attacktowards the Canal was discussed, as was the pro-
posed response of an Anglo-French ultimatum
requiring both sides to withdraw from the Canal.
This would then be followed by an Anglo-Frenchinvasion of the Canal Zone, as the Egyptians werebound to reject the ultimatum. Eden fell in with
this deception and, after the return of the prime
minister and the foreign secretary to London, the
Cabinet endorsed it too.Events now moved swiftly to their climax. Asthe Israelis were assigned the role of starting thewar, they would need to be certain of the support
of the British and French. A general understand-
ing was not enough – there had to be a precise
timetable too. It was one thing for Eden andLloyd to say what Britain would do if, supposedlyregrettably, the Israelis attacked Egypt and threat-
ened the Canal. It was quite another to encour-
age and pre-plan with Israel an attack on Egypt
to be followed by Anglo-French intervention.Israel’s war objective was not the Suez Canal inany case, but the breaking of a naval blockade of
the Tiran Straits dominated at its mouth by the
Egyptian batteries at Sharm al-Sheikh. The mili-
tary sideshow towards the Canal was intended
only to provide Britain and France with thepretext they needed to join Israel in defeatingNasser. The Israelis would open hostilities as part
of the general plan only if they secured watertight
guarantees from the British. Prime Minister Ben
Gurion, accompanied by General Dayan, ﬂew toParis at the invitation of the French to confer withthem and the British. The crucial secret discus-
sions were held in a villa in the suburb of Sèvres.Mollet and Pineau and the Israelis were joinedon 22 October 1956 by the foreign secretary,
Selwyn Lloyd, who was uneasy about the wholescheme. On Eden’s instructions the discussionswere to be so secret that no ofﬁcial record was 
to be made of them. The Israelis nevertheless
made notes. Selwyn Lloyd conﬁrmed that if the
Israelis decided to attack Egypt Britain andFrance would intervene to safeguard the SuezCanal. A timetable was discussed. The Israeli
attack was to begin on 29 October. The Israelis
had been promised the support of French pilots,planes and warships. At Sèvres there was discus-sion about how long after an Anglo-French ulti-matum the bombing of Egyptian airﬁelds would
begin. Nothing had been deﬁnitely decided when
Lloyd left to consult Eden and the Cabinet.In fact the meeting had not gone well. BenGurion’s mistrust of the British in general andSelwyn Lloyd and Eden in particular had not been
lessened by the encounter. In London the fol-
lowing day, 23 October, the Cabinet received a
report from Selwyn Lloyd about the secret Paris
meeting which indicated that the Israelis wouldnot launch a war on their own. One implication,therefore, was that Israel would start a war allow-
ing Britain and France to intervene only if a prior
agreement with Britain and France had been
reached. The Cabinet met again on 24 October.From a confusing discussion it was not evident tothem that an agreement with Israel actually to
launch a war was being contemplated. That same
day, Foreign Ofﬁce ofﬁcial Sir Patrick Dean was
sent back to Paris after being instructed by Eden.He was authorised to reach an agreement withthe Israelis on the military timetable.The Paris discussions ended with a three-pagetyped statement in French embodying ‘the results
of the conversations which took place at Sèvres
from 22–24 October 1956 between the repre-sentatives of the governments of the UnitedKingdom, of the State of Israel and of France’.
The much debated agreement, which still has not
been ofﬁcially published, provided, ﬁrst, that the
Israelis would launch a large-scale attack onEgyptian forces on 29 October and would thrusttowards the Canal Zone on the 30th; second, that
on the 30th Britain and France would ‘appeal’ to
the Egyptian and Israeli governments to halt acts
of war, withdraw troops ten miles from the Canal
(this left the Israelis in Egyptian territory) andaccept the temporary occupation of key positionson the Canal by Anglo-French forces until a ﬁnal
settlement guaranteeing free passage to all nations
could be reached. If Egypt or Israel did not agree
within twelve hours, Anglo-French forces wouldintervene. Third, if the Egyptians did not agree,Britain and France would launch military opera-
tions on 31 October; there was a provision that
the Israeli forces would occupy the Egyptian11956: CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST – SUEZ449
western shore of the Gulf of Aqaba. Fourth, Israelundertook not to attack Jordan unless Jordanattacked it; in that event the British would not
come to the aid of Jordan. An article was added
which stipulated that the agreement would be
kept strictly secret. Finally, it was stated that theagreement would enter into force after the con-currence of the three governments.On 26 October the Israelis received France’sassurance in a letter from the prime minister.
Britain’s agreement was circuitous; it took the
form of a letter to Mollet from Eden noting theconversations at Sèvres and conﬁrming ‘that inthe situation there envisaged they [Britain] will
take the action described’. Why such circumlocu-
tion? It was an attempt by Eden to lay the basis
for a denial that there had been any secret treatybetween the three countries to attack Egypt –Eden believed it could be presented merely as a
contingency plan, setting down what Britain
would do in certain circumstances. He would
claim that he could not be certain the circum-stances would arise. The difference unfortunatelywas rather less than paper-thin. Eden had all
along wanted to avoid a treaty, any written and
signed agreement. But the hapless Dean, not
knowing this, had added his signature to Pineau’s
and Ben Gurion’s copies and taken his copy backto London. Eden was upset when he learnt thatthere was now a written record. Of course, if it
had all been entirely above board he would not
have minded. Dean was sent back to Paris to
retrieve all the copies so that they could bedestroyed. He did not succeed. Ben Gurion, eversuspicious of the British, had carefully folded the
document in his pocket and returned with it to
Israel. Neither he nor Pineau would now give up
their copies. The British request added a touch of
humiliation to the subterfuges adopted to coverup the secret arrangements. The way was nowclear for the military plans to go ahead.If the collusion with Israel was not to beobvious, the Anglo-French invasion of the Canal
Zone could only take place for logistical reasonssix days after the Israelis began the campaign. Thetroops that would have to be conveyed to Port
Said were assembled in Malta and Cyprus; it was
expected to take eight days from the start ofIsrael’s attack to ferry them to Egypt. Nor couldthe parachute brigade stationed in Cyprus bedropped immediately without land support, so
they too would have to wait. But it was part of
the secret tripartite agreement that Egyptian air-
ﬁelds would be bombed at dawn on 31 October,some thirty-six hours after the Israeli attack, so asto put the Soviet-supplied Egyptian bombers out
of action. The French had also secretly agreed to
station their ﬁghters in Israel to protect its cities.The final preparations were made with theAmericans still being kept in the dark. TheHungarian rising was occupying the headlines ofthe world press. The presidential elections too
were rapidly approaching, with voting on 6
November. A few ships were authorised to leave
Valletta Harbour in Malta on Sunday night, 28October, and the aircraft-carriers on the morningof the 29th, that is before the Israeli attack that
same afternoon. All that weekend preparations
had been actively under way in Malta and Cyprus.
The Anglo-French and Israeli troop movementsalerted Dulles and Eisenhower in Washington.But from London to Washington there was a
freeze on all communication about the impend-
ing Suez war. The majority of government min-
isters in London too were not fully briefed. The
same was true of British ambassadors abroad, sogreat was the secrecy insisted upon by Eden.At 5 p.m. on 29 October the Israelis begantheir attack as arranged. Their prime object was
to reach the tip of the Sinai Peninsula, where the
batteries at Sharm al-Sheikh were closing theStraits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. The batterieswere taken on 5 November. A diversionary thrust
towards the Canal also began on 29 October and
was completed by 2 November, with Israeli para-
chutists, after suffering severe casualties, captur-
ing the Mitla Pass some forty miles from theCanal. On 30 October Britain and France senttheir ultimatum to Egypt and Israel to withdraw
ten miles from the Canal, according to the Sèvres
scheme. Egypt was given just twelve hours to
reply.In Washington the response was anger, height-ened by the fact that the British–French–Israeli
deﬁance of international law was distracting atten-
tion from the brutal Soviet repression of450THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
Hungary. Eisenhower made it clear that the USwould not back France and Britain. At homeHugh Gaitskell, the leader of the Labour Party,
warned Eden on 31 October that his party would
not support the government in warlike actions
against Egypt. Gaitskell received no answer whenhe demanded to know if Britain was at war. Bythe morning of the 31st, the ultimatum had
expired but no shot had been ﬁred by Britain or
France. The Security Council was in session in
New York that day. In Cairo, Nasser had not pan-
icked, but was getting ready to defend Egyptfrom the threatened Anglo-French assault. TheBritish ambassador was still unmolested, occupy-
ing the Embassy in Cairo; to preserve secrecy he
had not been recalled; nor were the British and
French civilian employees of the Suez CanalCompany evacuated in time – this put many civil-ian lives at risk. Then during the evening of 31
October RAF Canberras and Valiants started
bombing Egyptian airfields. The Egyptian air
force was grounded throughout the Suez War,thus removing Israel’s principal concern.The attack on Egypt in breach of the UNCharter deeply divided the British people. In the
House of Commons the Conservative majority
ensured the defeat of a motion of censure tabled
by the Labour Party, and much popular opinionwelcomed Britain’s standing up to Nasser,though the more thoughtful condemned the
aggression. But there was no doubt where the US
stood. Dulles nevertheless attempted to help
Britain by delaying United Nations action. Franceand Britain were able, by using their veto power,to stymie the Security Council, but they could
not prevent the General Assembly from acting
under the United for Peace Resolution invoked
six years earlier when the Korean War broke out.
Even so, the interval between the air attack onEgypt on 31 October and the actual main land-ings of troops brought by sea was too long. On
3 November, unhappily for Britain, Dulles – who
was trying to limit the damage – entered hospital
for a cancer operation that put him out of action.On 4 November the General Assembly called onthe secretary-general to arrange a ceaseﬁre.The pressure on the three belligerents was nowconsiderable. The Israelis promised to comply ifthe Egyptians also agreed to a ceaseﬁre. Nasser,though, was naturally not intimidated, given theworldwide condemnation of Britain and France.
He was ready to carry on a guerrilla struggle if
Britain and France occupied the Canal Zone.
Meanwhile differences were also opening upbetween Britain and France on how best to carryon military operations. After the UN ceaseﬁre res-
olution, Eden was determined that the invasion
should take place even though he had accepted
‘in principle’ a UN peacekeeping force to take
over from the British and French. The creation ofa peacekeeping force was approved by the UN on4 November; a day later French and British para-
troops landed in the Canal Zone. The main
landing from the sea followed on the 6th. The
Anglo-French troops needed only three moredays to advance south from Port Said and to com-plete the occupation of the Canal Zone. But
politically time had run out.The Soviet Union issued nuclear threats whileengaged in bloody repression of the Hungarianrising. But US pressure on Israel, plus the captureof Sharm al-Sheikh, decided the Israelis to stop
fighting. How could Britain and France now
credibly continue, given that they had claimed
that the purpose of the military action was to keep
Egypt and Israel apart? The French were ready todefy the UN for a little longer, but Eden saw no alternative to accepting the ceasefire on 6
November. Harold Macmillan, the chancellor of
the exchequer, forecast a ﬁnancial catastrophe as
foreigners were depleting their sterling holdingsand the US was refusing to help. There wouldanyway be the additional costs of bringing in oil
now that the Egyptians had blocked the Canal by
scuttling ﬁfty ships.What had been achieved? Eden’s reputation forstatesmanship had been tarnished just as ill healthforced him to rest. He left for Jamaica on 23
November, but it was the prelude to his retire-
ment in January 1957, a sad end to a long and
distinguished career. UN troops began arriving inPort Said in late November 1956. Anglo-American relations reached their lowest ebb that
autumn with the re-elected Eisenhower adminis-
tration refusing either to ship oil from the Gulf11956: CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST – SUEZ451
of Mexico or to help stem the ﬂight from thepound. Without dollar support Britain could notafford to pay for the oil from the Western hemi-
sphere. But relations improved the moment the
Anglo-French troops handed over to the UN
peacekeeping force; the British and French ﬁnallyleft two days before Christmas. The French primeminister was then welcomed in Washington; 
ironically, it was Macmillan, originally a strong
proponent of the Suez adventure, who succeeded
Eden in January 1957 and was received by
Eisenhower and Dulles the following March inBermuda. The alliance was restored. On 24 Aprilof that year the Egyptian Canal Authority opened
the Canal to trafﬁc again. Nasser had not fallen.
The Zone and the Canal were the property of
Egypt. The Americans, pronouncing the Eisen-hower Doctrine in January 1957, attempted to ﬁllthe void left by the defeat of Britain and France
in the Middle East.The conﬂicts of Suez were just a part of thecontinuing Middle Eastern crisis which the Westfailed to solve then or later. When it came toarmed conﬂict, in 1947, neither Britain nor the
US had been prepared to jeopardise its relations
with the oil-rich Middle East to ensure an inde-
pendent Israel in Palestine. The Israelis had to
achieve this by their own fortitude. The TripartiteDeclaration of 1950 might then have served as abasis for a great-power imposition of peace, but
the Cold War, the rise of Nasser and his challenge
eventually to Israel, France and Britain sowed
divisions in the West and shifted Britain, Franceand the US away from the role of impartial peace-keepers. The Soviet Union took advantage of this
to fuel Egyptian–Israeli tensions by its large arms
deliveries to Nasser. The Anglo-French attack on
Egypt in collusion with Israel appeared to serve
the interests of all three nations threatened byNasser’s ambitions.Eden only entered late, in mid-October 1956,into the plan. He knew that the US did notbelieve during the summer and early autumn thatdiplomacy had been exhausted. It seemed, ac-cording to Washington’s perceptions, that Egypt
was showing readiness to compromise in order to
reach a settlement over the Canal. The French
from the start were far more ready to act inde-pendently; it was they who persuaded Eden tojoin in the Sèvres scenario and to work behind
America’s back. Eden and Mollet mistakenly
believed that Eisenhower, faced with presidential
elections on 6 November 1956, would not be
able to act against Israel, Britain and France ifthey attacked Egypt before then. Finally, the con-dition the Israelis made that they would launch
an attack on the Egyptians, which was to provide
the pretext of French and British intervention,
only if the British and French neutralised theEgyptian air force by bombing their airbaseswithin thirty-six hours of the Israeli attack was
bound to reveal the collusion. In a vain attempt
to preserve the ﬁction of the impartial policemen,
the main combat forces were obviously not sup-posed to sail from their base in Malta until afterthe start of hostilities between Israel and Egypt.
(They actually left a little earlier.) It was thought
that they would need at least eight days, though
they actually made it in six, reaching Port Said on
6 November. That had left a week for the inter-national community at the UN to intervene. HadFrance and Britain been less concerned to main-
tain the ﬁction of not colluding with Israel they
could have landed earlier and faced the US and
the UN with a fait accompli and occupied theCanal Zone; they could even have dispensed withIsraeli cooperation altogether. But even a suc-
cessful occupation of the Canal Zone would not
have been the end of the affair. In the last resort
it was not really a question of timing. It was not
the Americans who doomed Suez to disaster. Themost powerful Western nations could no longersimply impose their will on the whole region
without unacceptable costs to themselves.452THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
One common bond between the Arab nationswas hostility to Israel. Beyond this the rivalries
between the Arab rulers, the old and the new, led
to bewildering diplomatic manoeuvres, coups andchanges of sides, some even secretly securingIsraeli assistance. The outside powers and the
Cold War further complicated what were rapidly
changing alignments in the Middle East after
1956. There, international, regional and internal
struggles for predominance have created contin-uing war and conﬂict.The Anglo-French debacle at Suez raisedNasser’s prestige enormously. But he was handi-
capped by Egypt’s poverty and lack of valuable
resources such as oil; indebted more and more tothe Soviet Union to pay for new weapons, Egypthad to pledge its only important cash crop,
cotton, in return. The rapid growth of the pop-
ulation meant that increased production hardly
improved the lot of the peasants and the urban
poor. Nor did the Aswan High Dam deliver thepromised transformation of the Egyptian peas-antry. But externally Egypt looked as if it might
assume a powerful place in the Middle East. The
pan-Arab cause appeared to be in the ascendant
when Syria in 1958 initiated steps to unite withEgypt to form the United Arab Republic. OtherArab nations were invited to join. But Syria was
as poor as Egypt and the union was largely one
of paper only. The only other state to join was
the poorest of all the Arab states, Yemen. Therewas no geographical contiguity between thesethree nations. The union did not last long: inSeptember 1961 the pro-Nasserites were over-
thrown in a military coup in Syria, which there-
upon left the United Arab Republic. It was noserious loss, but the Yemen connection provedvery costly for Egypt.In 1963 civil war broke out in the Yemen ArabRepublic. The hereditary rulers were backed by
Saudi Arabia, and the ofﬁcers who had rebelled
looked to Moscow and Egypt for support. Egyptdespatched some 70,000 troops eventually andthe ﬁghting dragged on, a costly drain on the
Egyptian treasury. The other Yemen, which 
comprised what had from 1956 to 1967 been
Britain’s Aden and hinterland, turned itself intothe pro-Soviet People’s Democratic Republic ofYemen. (Uniﬁcation of the two Yemens was even-
tually proclaimed in May 1990. The new state was
named the Republic of Yemen.) To complicate
matters further, while Egypt and Saudi Arabia
were sworn enemies and at war by proxy in theYemen, Saudi Arabia supported Egypt in its con-ﬂict with Israel. But, until rearmed, Nasser could
not contemplate another war with Israel. For ten
years raids into Israel from Egyptian territory
ceased. It was an armed peace. Nor was there anyattempt to stop Israeli commerce from using theseaport of Eilat and passing down the Gulf of
Aqaba through the Straits of Tiran. The passage
was guaranteed by France, Britain and the US.

OMANThe Middle East, 1960–2and was stationed in the Sinai Desert on theEgyptian side of the Egyptian–Israeli border.In reality, Nasser’s position after Suez was aweak one. There was no hiding the fact of his
defeat by Israel. No one realised this more clearly
than the astute King Hussein of Jordan. BeforeSuez he had been forced by powerful groups in hiscountry to denounce the West and to embrace
Egypt. After Nasser’s defeat by Israel, Egypt was in
no condition to interfere. In April 1957 Hussein
foiled a coup and declared martial law, assuming
personal power with the support of the army.With Egypt and Syria already relying on Sovietsupport, the US stepped into the vacuum left by
the British after Suez. The so-called Eisenhower
Doctrine, approved by Congress and signed by
the president in March 1957, involved the USmore deeply in the Middle East. The US offeredeconomic and military aid and empowered the
president to use armed force to assist any nation
in the Middle East requesting such help against
armed aggression ‘from any country controlled byinternational communism’. Since the Cold Warwas not the root cause of instability and conﬂict
in the Middle East, the Doctrine did not con-
tribute a great deal to peace.For Arab leaders to embrace the US openly asfriend and protector in the 1960s and 1970s wasmade virtually impossible by American supportfor Israel. Only Lebanon, with a Christian non-
Arab president, responded positively to Eisen-

hower. To counter the Soviet alignment with
Egypt and Syria, Eisenhower ordered the USSixth Fleet into the eastern Mediterranean andsent ﬁnancial aid to Jordan. The US also tried to
destabilise the regime in Syria. This attempt
failed. Worse still, the West’s most reliable ally,
Iraq, changed regimes and left the Baghdad Pact.In July 1958 a bloody revolution broke out inIraq, and the king and his chief pro-Western min-
ister were brutally killed. General Abdel Kassem,
with local communist help, seized power. In
Jordan, King Hussein was greatly alarmed and,
fearing for his throne, asked for British help.Britain sent troops and Hussein held shakily on to power. For a time too, in response to a call 
for assistance from the Lebanese president, US
marines were landed from the Sixth Fleet. As itturned out, it was not these applications of theEisenhower Doctrine that constrained the Sovietsin the Middle East, but the rivalry of the Arab
nations among themselves. Fundamental to inter-
Arab conﬂict was the hostility between Iraq and
Egypt. Nasser interpreted communist support forIraq’s General Kassem as an unfriendly act towardsEgypt. By the spring of 1959 Kassem denounced
Nasser, and Nasser denounced Kassem.Ultimately neither the Soviet Union nor theUS could enlist the Middle Eastern nations in the
Cold War. The leaders of these nations were pri-marily concerned with their internal and regionalconﬂicts; they made use of Cold War antagonisms
to further their own interests. The naval-base facil-
ities that the Soviet navy acquired over the years in
Egypt, Syria, Libya and the People’s DemocraticRepublic of Yemen as well as on the Red Seaentailed great costs directly and indirectly. Foreign
naval bases, moreover, are dependent on the
changing attitudes and policies of the leaders in
power in these unstable countries. The SovietUnion’s expensive policy was singularly unsuccess-ful. In one respect, though, it was a major player
in the Middle East and that was in its role of sup-
plying arms to Israel’s principal enemies, Egypt,
Syria and Iraq. This, in turn, stimulated the US
and other Western nations to try to replace theSoviet Union as the provider of arms. Inevitablythe Middle East became a danger to world peace.Israel, despite its historic roots, is a new countrywhose development in the post-war world hasbeen astonishing. The great majority of the peoplewho built the nation had left a Europe whose soil
had been soaked with Jewish blood. The young
ﬁghters and pioneers who had reached what was
Palestine before 1947 had lost their families in
Hitler’s Holocaust and in Poland, even after thewar had come to an end. The diverse EuropeanJews speaking no common language were forced
into a nation sharing one purpose above all others:
they would never again be defenceless. They are
bound together by the common memory of theHolocaust when no nation cared enough to try tosave Jewish men, women and children.The immigrants to Palestine did not come toempty lands. The Jews settled in towns which1THE STRUGGLE FOR PREDOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST455
then ﬂourished and prospered. There was enoughroom for Arabs and Jews in Palestine. There weremany who believed they could live well together,
but instead the Jewish immigration ended in con-
ﬂict and a struggle for predominance. The Arabs,
displaced from their land, were ﬁlled with resent-ment and hatred for the new settlers from otherparts of the world. There were many Jews who
claimed the land as theirs by historical right,
looking back to the kingdom of David and its
capital city, Jerusalem, established a thousand
years before Christ. But there had been no Jewishstate for 2,000 years since its extinction in Romantimes. Jews had been dispersed (the diaspora) to
live in the Christian and Islamic world. Their reli-
gion and culture survived and with them the
belief that there would one day be a return to theHoly Land. An orthodox Jewish community hadconstituted the largest single religious group in
Jerusalem since 1840. (The others were the
Christians and Muslims.) It was persecution in the
Russian Empire in the late nineteenth century andNazi persecution and Soviet discrimination in thetwentieth that created a mass migration of Jews
from central and Eastern Europe. Until then
Zionism had attracted only a small minority of
European Jews; the majority were proud to be
Germans, Poles and Hungarians. (The Jews ofBritain, France and the US are still proud citizensof their countries, even if they materially support
Israel at the same time.)The early pioneers from central and EasternEurope have provided the great majority ofIsrael’s political leaders up to the present day.Chaim Weizmann, the ﬁrst president of Israel,
and David Ben Gurion, its ﬁrst prime minister
and dominant political leader until 1963, were
both born in Russian Poland. Golda Meir was
born in Kiev, and after she and her parents hademigrated to the US in 1906, she settled in 1921at the age of eighteen in a kibbutz; prominent in
politics and diplomacy she became prime minis-
ter in 1969 on the death of Levi Eshkol.
Menachem Begin’s family perished in Poland; hehad headed the Irgun and uncompromisinglyclaimed the whole biblical land of Israel. The
strong political inﬂuence of central and Eastern
European Jews is not surprising. They formed the largest group of immigrants from 1903 to1939, some 200,000. In the 1930s a new waveof immigrants from Germany, about 50,000,
entered Palestine. The majority were profession-
als, doctors, lawyers, teachers, traders or the chil-
dren of middle-class parents, whereas the majorityof Eastern and central European Jews were skilledworkers or farmers. It is perhaps surprising that
the German-descended Israelis have not played a
larger political role so far. After 1945 the sur-
vivors of the death camps who came to Palestine
were again mainly Jews from Eastern Europe andthe Balkans. The next large-scale migration afterthe war for independence came from the Middle
East, the oriental Jews, of Morocco, Tunisia,
Syria, Egypt and the Yemen. They were the least
educated and as a group are economically andsocially the least privileged. After three genera-tions the gap between the European and oriental
Jews remains wide and is only slowly narrowing,
despite common service in the army, which is a
great leveller. The Jews of the former SovietUnion provided the largest group of immigrantsin the 1970s and 1980s.The population of Israel, excluding the territor-ies conquered in the 1967 war, grew almost six
times from 750,000 in 1948 to 2.8 million by
1968 and to 6.4 million in 2001. Not all are Jews.In 1948–9 some 600,000 Palestinian Arabs ﬂed to
neighbouring Arab countries and became refugees
in camps, but 150,000 remained in their homes in
Israel; by 2001 they had grown to over 1 million
of whom 966,000 were Muslims mainly Sunni and134,000 were Christians. In the West Bank and Gaza there are about 200,000 Jewish settlers
and more than 3 million Arab Palestinians. In
Israel, the Arab Muslims were clinging to their
land as peasant farmers and poor villagers, eco-

nomically the great majority remained disadvan-
taged and from 1949 until the 1960s, their loyaltysuspected, they were placed under many restric-

tions, curfews and military rule. Yet outwardly they
were accorded the civic rights of all Israeli citizens,
including the right to vote for the Israeli parlia-
ment, the Knesset. Then in the 1960s a policy tointegrate them was followed with some success.
The Palestinian Arab Israelis have remained a
separate community, sympathetic to the Pale-

stinians denied self-determination in the occupiedlands of the West Bank and Gaza (after the 1967war), but they remain Israelis striving for equality,
their economic well-being far higher now than that
of the Palestinian Arabs outside the State of Israel,
with a sizeable middle class.Israel is the only democracy in the MiddleEast, with a multiplicity of parties already well
established in Palestine before independence. The
dominant party forming the core of all coalitions
until 1977 was the Labour Party (Mapai), the
leftist Mapam never enjoying anywhere near thesame support. The Herut belonged to the right-wing group of parties. The third minority group
was composed of the religious parties, who
wished to expand religious law in the Jewish state;
their influence was often greater than theirnumbers in the Knesset would have justifiedbecause they could demand a price for agreeing
to join the coalition governments formed after
elections. The bargaining that preceded the coali-
tion agreements – especially in the 1980s whenthe adherence of minor parties became crucial –added cynicism and disillusionment to the demo-
cratic process of Israeli politics.The biggest challenge facing Israeli govern-ments at home has been and remains how to
absorb thousands of destitute immigrants. Israelis open to all Jews who wish to settle there. Thecosts are huge and, when added to the immense
burdens of defence, present difﬁculties of bud-
getary management unique among the developed
countries. The Labour Party, a pragmatic partyquite willing to compromise socialist principles,followed policies encouraging capitalist invest-

ment. Economic growth has been one of the
most rapid in the developed world, ﬁnanced by
loans, grants, gifts (especially from the US) and
German reparations payments. This has, however,burdened the economy with a large external debt.It has also created an Israeli dependence on the
goodwill of the US, a relationship reinforced by
a dependence on weapons from the West, with
ﬁrst France and then the US supplying the tanksand the aircraft essential for Israel’s security.The brilliant military commanders of Israel’svictories in war play an inﬂuential role in Israeli
politics, readily exchanging active army servicewith Cabinet posts in government. Moshe Dayanwas a successful leader in war and a hawk in peacefrom the creation of Israel to the Yom Kippur
War in 1973; General Yitzhak Rabin took over as
prime minister from Golda Meir after serving as
chief of staff in the Six-Day War of 1967; GeneralYigal Allon, Dayan’s rival as a military hero,served as foreign minister in the 1970s and
General Ariel Sharon, the military hero of the
1973 war when his tanks crossed the Suez Canal
and trapped the Egyptian Third Army in the
Sinai, became a dominant member of MenachemBegin’s Cabinet and masterminded the Israeliinvasion of Lebanon in 1982 and later served as
a hardline prime minister.Israel enjoyed a breathing space of ten yearsafter the Suez–Sinai War of 1956. Neither Nassernor Hussein wished to plunge his country intoanother war with Israel for the sake of the
Palestinians. Indeed, the establishment of a
Palestinian Arab state was not part of the pro-
gramme of any of the Arab national leaders. Butwhen Nasser’s bid for Arab leadership and hisefforts to export his revolution met with resolute
opposition from the royal leaders of Jordan and
Saudi Arabia, and with hostility in Syria and Iraq,
the only pan-Arab appeal left to him was to
emphasise the common enemy – Israel. RadioCairo broadcast hate campaigns against theJewish state, and President Nasser himself pro-
claimed in a speech in Alexandria on 26 July
1959, ‘I announce from here, on behalf of the
United Arab Republic people, that this time wewill exterminate Israel.’ On 27 May 1967, ninedays before the start of the Six-Day War, he
declared, ‘Our basic objective will be the destruc-
tion of Israel.’ No less extreme was the president
of Iraq on 31 May 1967: ‘The existence of Israel
is an error which must be rectiﬁed. This is ouropportunity to wipe out the ignominy which hasbeen with us since 1948. Our goal is clear – to
wipe Israel off the map.’ These bloodcurdling
speeches can be dismissed as public rhetoric, since
they are belied by the much more cautious atti-tudes otherwise displayed by Arab leaders. But forIsraelis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem it was clear that
their very survival would be threatened if ever
they should prove the weaker in the continuing1THE STRUGGLE FOR PREDOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST457
conﬂict, for the Arab nations refused to makepeace or to recognise Israel’s right to exist.Israel’s response to Arab enmity is to place thewhole nation in arms. A professional nucleus of
ofﬁcers and NCOs is supplemented by conscripts:
every man and woman has to serve for two to threeyears; then follows a long period in the reserve (formen to the age of forty-nine) with annual battle
training. The standing army of some 80,000 can in
time of emergency be quickly mobilised into a
force of 300,000. The army, the air force and the
small navy, in a constant state of readiness for war,have always proved effective when put to the test.Arab Israelis are not conscripted but a minority
have fought in the Israeli army.While Nasser rebuilt and re-equipped theEgyptian army with Soviet help, Israel continuedto strengthen its relations with France, a source ofsome of the best weapons and aircraft. The French
also helped Israel to build up a nuclear potential
with the construction of the Dimona reactor. The
unsigned alliance with the US, however, remainedthe sheet anchor of Israel’s international security.After seven relatively peaceful years, in 1964
Israeli–Arab tensions once more began to grow.
The Israelis completed a project to divert some of
the waters of the Jordan and the Sea of Galilee,
which sparked a belligerent Syrian response.Nasser felt obliged to fulﬁl the role of pan-Arableader and summoned a conference in Cairo in
1964. The Arab nations were not ready for war,
but 1964 was notable for the endorsement given
later in the year to Yasser Arafat and for the for-mation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.Coupled with Arab non-recognition of Israel this
was an ominous development. But Nasser had too
many problems at home – attempting to advance
the economy, ﬁghting in the Yemen and losing
US economic aid – to be thinking of any immedi-ate resumption of war. The most extreme Arabregime was the Syrian.Syria’s politics consisted of unstable powerplays between rival groups. In 1966 the most
radical wing of the Ba’ath seized power andsought to consolidate its grip by taking the leadin ﬁghting for the liberation of Palestine. Syrian
gunﬁre harassed Israeli settlements on the fron-
tier, armed Palestinians belonging to Fatah (thePLO’s largest fedayeen guerrilla group) and sup-ported by Syria, infiltrated Israel during theautumn and winter of 1966–7, raided settlements
and set off explosives. The Israelis sent retaliatory
raids into the territory of their Arab neighbours,
sometimes to attack Palestinian bases, sometimeshitting innocent Arabs in Jordan and the Lebanonand causing many deaths. Israel, Syria, Jordan and
Egypt were drifting into an all-out war. Nasser,
albeit hesitantly, escalated the crisis, unable as
self-styled leader of the Arab world to appear to
follow in Syria’s militant footsteps. The Israeligovernment was also cautious, not believing thatit really faced an imminent war. The Soviets,
meanwhile, were stirring up the Egyptians with
intelligence reports that Israel was readying for an
all-out invasion of Syria, though the Israelis wereprobably only preparing another punitive strikeagainst Syria for supporting Palestinian raids.
Nasser moved army units into the Sinai in mid-
May 1967, and terminated the right of UN
observer troops to remain on Egypt’s Sinaifrontier with Israel. But his most decisive hostilechallenge, on 22 May 1967, was to close the Gulf
of Aqaba to Israeli shipping. Then, on 30 May,
King Hussein placed his troops under Egyptian
command. Washington tried to ease the tension,
but in Israel the Rubicon was crossed when on 1June the moderate prime minister, Levi Eshkol,appointed General Dayan, who had been chief of
staff in 1956, to be defence minister; Dayan
insisted that Israel had to defend itself by war. 
On 4 June Iraq joined the Jordanian–Egyptianmilitary pact.Early in the morning on 5 June 1967, theIsraelis struck. The Six-Day War astonished the
world by its demonstration of the immense super-
iority of the Israeli armed forces. Within twenty-
four hours the air forces of Egypt and its allieshad been destroyed. The Egyptian pilots had notbeen sufficiently trained and the Soviet pilots 
stationed on their airbases stood aside. After six
days it was all over. Israeli divisions had reached
the Suez Canal and had raced down to the tip of the Sinai Peninsula, once again occupyingSharm al-Sheikh, which commanded the passage
through the Straits of Tiran. Israeli forces also
occupied the Gaza Strip, which was inhabited by458THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
Palestinians and under Egyptian sovereignty.Jordan joined in the war despite Israeli pleas tostay out. Israeli troops then fought house-to-
house battles against Jordanian forces, suffering
heavy casualties before capturing East Jerusalem
and the West Bank. In the north, the Israelisbroke through the Syrian defences and occupiedthe Golan Heights, from which Syrian artillery
had shelled Israeli settlements. Israel’s victories
against Egypt, Syria and Jordan were complete
and overwhelming. Everything had gone accord-
ing to the Israeli military plan. A major portionof the highly professional and efficient Israeliforce was composed of part-time soldiers who
spent eleven out of twelve months as civilians. 
It was an astonishing achievement that left the
Israelis elated and,with hindsight,over-conﬁdent.
The 1967 victory changed Israel for a generation,creating opportunities and problems not solved to
the present day.King Hussein’s decision to join Egypt cost himthe territory of the West Bank, which Jordan hadcaptured in 1948–9; before then it had formed apart of the British Palestine Mandate. Israel was
now faced with deciding what to do with the
845,000 hostile Palestinian Arabs living there.
When they had been Jordanian citizens they had
been Jordan’s problem. Under Israeli occupationthey demanded separate nationhood. The possi-bility of a ‘Jordanian solution’ for the time
receded as Israel’s capture of the Old City of
Jerusalem and its determination to retain an undi-
vided Jerusalem as its capital blocked any peace-ful arrangement with Jordan despite the largePalestinian population in post-war Jordan.
Adding the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip,
the Israelis had now assumed responsibility for
more than 1 million Arab Palestinians. Unlike
their predecessors in 1948–9, the Arabs had notﬂed, but neither could they be reconciled to livingunder foreign occupation. The Israelis at first
regarded the occupied territories as bargaining
counters to attain peace; security required that
they retain a relatively small part; the rest wouldbe returned in exchange for peace treaties. ThenIsrael would enjoy secure borders and peace. It
did not work out that way, though. Years later, it
is true, peace was secured on this basis withEgypt. But the longer Israel occupied Gaza, EastJerusalem and the West Bank, the stronger grewthe voices of those who claimed the territories as
Israel’s historic land and the more Jewish settle-
ments expanded.The famous UN Resolution 242 passed by theSecurity Council on 22 November 1967, despiteits ambiguities and the different Arab and Israeli
interpretations, provided a framework for peace
negotiations. It promised Israel secure frontiers, it
required it to withdraw from the conquered terri-
tories and stated the need for a just solution forthe Palestinian refugees. But it was only a frame-work. There was no timetable for implementation;
and no enforcement provision. Nasser had already
in September 1967, at a conference of the Arab
heads of state in Khartoum, made an uncompro-mising demand for complete withdrawal of theIsraelis and insisted that there could be no peace
with Israel or negotiations without recognition of
‘the rights of the Palestinian People in their own
country’. The Arab nations did not move fromthis stand until Egypt broke ranks in 1977. TheIsraelis in turn were not prepared to give up what
they had gained without something in return.
Their interpretation of Resolution 242 is that it
assures Israel safe and secure frontiers and that
consequently the extent of its withdrawal has ﬁrstto be negotiated between Israel and the Arabnations involved: such negotiations must precede
any withdrawal. The Israelis rejected withdrawal
prior to possible negotiations.It would take another war before Egypt wasready to negotiate and conclude a separate peacewith Israel. But in the intervening years the inﬂu-

ence of the right in Israel grew, the inﬂuence of

politicians like Begin who passionately argued
against giving up the territories of the West Bank,
biblical Israel (‘Judaea’ and ‘Samaria’). Nasser pro-
claimed a war of attrition against Israel in 1968;Palestinian guerrilla raids and sporadic Egyptian
attacks forced Israel to remain on constant alert;
the two sides also shelled each other across the
Suez Canal until a ceaseﬁre was agreed in August
1970. This provided only a breathing space.In September 1970, Nasser died. His deathwas mourned by millions of Egyptians and Arabs
throughout the Middle East. He was not a1THE STRUGGLE FOR PREDOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST459
scheming dictator, the reincarnation of Hitler, ashe was seen at the time by some in Britain and
France. In contrast to leaders elsewhere in theMiddle East in his time and later, in Syria, Iranand Iraq, he was not a tyrant, killing thousands
of opponents. Nor, unlike his royal predecessors,
was he corrupt. He genuinely wanted to raise thestandard of living of the Egyptian masses, but hisstate socialism and police security brought only
order, without prosperity. He was defeated in hisaims by population growth and by the costly warshe fought against Israel and in the Yemen. He
fought to restore Arab pride and, despite his
defeat, was paradoxically triumphant in achieving460THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80

Israel and the Arab states after 1967this wider goal. In the West, the Egyptians andother Arabs had been regarded as a lesser speciesof humanity, servile and incompetent. All that
changed in 1956 when Nasser nationalised the
Suez Canal and humiliated Britain and France.
He served notice on the feudal royals left in the
Arab world that the time was coming to an end
when they could rule without the participation of
the people, but half a century later they are still
there. All of this boosted Arab self-esteem,
without which there can be no peace between
Israel and its neighbours in the Middle East.
Nasser’s attitude to the Cold War, too, can now
be judged in a new perspective. He manipulated
Moscow and Washington to supply him witharms and aid but supported the neutrality of theThird World, the poorer countries, which could
only lose and not gain by becoming involved in
the conﬂicts of the superpowers.Egypt’s next president Anwar Sadat, after the fail-ure of the US to bring the two sides together,
believed he was faced either with accepting Israel’s
conditions of peace or with ﬁghting once more.
He chose the latter. On 6 October 1973, the
Jewish Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, Syrian
and Egyptian forces attacked Israel. Until hours
before the attack was launched, the Israelis had
not expected an all-out war and the Cabinet hadrejected another pre-emptive strike. Mobilisationof reserves was ordered too late. The initial attacks
broke through the much smaller Israeli forces, and
it was not until the civilians were mobilised that
the Syrians could be halted in the north. The
ﬁghting against the Egyptians, whose tanks had
successfully crossed into the Sinai, proved far more
difficult. Only when General Sharon daringly
crossed to the Egyptian side of the Suez Canal
with Israel’s armour on 15 October and so cut off
the 100,000-strong Egyptian Third Army in the
Sinai were the Israelis able to take the offensive.
But the Israelis, after suffering early losses of their
ﬁghters, brought down by Soviet-supplied mis-siles, had succeeded in turning the tables on Syriaand Egypt only after receiving replacement ﬁght-
ers and large quantities of arms ﬂown in from the
US. The unwritten Israeli–French alliance hadended after 1967, the French being now moreconcerned to get on better terms with the Arabstates; and neither Britain nor West Germany was
prepared to supply the arms the Israelis desper-
ately needed. This reticence did not help the
Western Europeans much. The Arab oil states
expressed their solidarity with Egypt and Syria by
imposing an oil embargo on the US and on all the
other countries that did not support the Arab
cause. Western Europe was hit by an oil shortage
and large price rises.Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state, was masterminding US policy. President Nixon was in
the grip of the Watergate crisis but he gave his 
full backing to Kissinger’s policy of working for adurable Arab–Israeli peace, ready to assist Israelonly to the extent of enabling it to defend itself
effectively but not so much as to produce an Israeli
victory as overwhelming as that in 1967. In that
respect the US and the Soviet Union held the same
views, and Brezhnev and Kissinger and Nixon
cooperated well during the ﬁrst few days of the

Yom Kippur War to bring about a ceaseﬁre. On 20

October, Kissinger ﬂew to Moscow at Brezhnev’s

invitation. The two superpowers agreed to present
a ceaseﬁre resolution to the Security Council on
the 22nd, which Syria, Egypt and Israel accepted
after some Soviet and US arm-twisting. Yet two
days later, during the night of 24–5 October, theUS placed its forces in readiness for war. After suchfruitful cooperation with the Kremlin, how had
events taken this turn? It seemed like the Cuban
missile crisis over again. Was the world on the
brink of the Third World War?The Israelis were the culprits initially, in thatthey failed to observe the truce completely; in an
attempt to improve their military position they
tightened the noose around the Egyptian Third
Army. Brezhnev responded with a proposal to the
US that a Soviet–American peacekeeping force be
sent. Kissinger did not wish to see Soviet troops in
the Middle East, but the forceful US reaction was
to the latter part of Brezhnev’s proposal, a threatthat if the US did not agree then ‘we should befaced with the necessity urgently to consider taking
appropriate steps unilaterally. Israel cannot be
allowed to get away with the violations.’ US
1THE STRUGGLE FOR PREDOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST461
intelligence at the same time detected evidence ofSoviet military preparations. Kissinger respondedwith a tough rejection, and US forces around the
world were placed on intermediate war alert. But
on 25 October Kissinger sent an olive branch: if
Brezhnev abandoned the idea of unilateral action,there would be no need for a confrontation at all.Brezhnev climbed down and that same day joined
with the US in sponsoring another United Nations
ceaseﬁre resolution setting up a UN peacekeeping
force that would exclude both US and Soviet con-

tingents. In return the US ensured that this timethe Israelis would stop all hostilities. The ThirdEgyptian Army was thus rescued, and Egypt and
Syria saved from further humiliation.The 1973 war was no walk-over for Israel. Thistime its losses in men and material were heavy:5,500 dead and wounded and 800 tanks des-troyed. Egypt’s and Syria’s losses were greater in
absolute terms but not in proportion to their
larger populations. Yet out of the Yom Kippur
War developed positive consequences. Egypt andSyria had to accept realistically that they could nothope to inﬂict a total defeat on Israel, but their
early successes had restored Arab pride. For the
Israelis a state of no peace imposed harsh burdens
and grave risks. They were now more prepared to
return Arab territory if they could thereby obtainpeace. For the Americans, the Arab–Israeli con-flict seemed only to provide opportunities for
Soviet intrusion in the Middle East. From this
matrix of interests, US diplomacy succeeded –
with the signature of the Camp David Accords inSeptember 1978 – in bringing Egypt and Israeltogether to agree a peace treaty. It is the corner-

stone on which a comprehensive peace still awaits
to be built a quarter of a century later.Amid the turmoil of inter-Arab conﬂicts and theArab–Israeli tensions and wars, of Soviet interven-tions in the Middle East and Iraq’s anti-Western
policies, the West had one powerful, oil-rich and
secure ally in Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran.Until Islamic Iran forced itself into the newsin the 1980s, the peoples of the Western worldhad only the haziest notions about the country
and its people. Iran lies between the Caspian Sea
and the Persian Gulf, and has borders with no lessthan five countries: to the north the SovietUnion, to the west Turkey and Iraq and to theeast Afghanistan and Pakistan. It occupies the
eastern shore of the Persian Gulf; on the north-
ern shore Iraq has an outlet along the estuary
Shatt al-Arab; from the north down the westernshore lies the oil-rich sheikhdom of Kuwait, thekingdom of Saudi Arabia and the sheikhdoms of
Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and
Oman. It is oil that gives this region its signiﬁ-
cance, supplying much of the needs of Western
Europe and Japan, with additional exports to theUS, the Middle East and Africa. A glance at a mapreveals Iran’s and Iraq’s key positions. Iran is a
vast country of 627,000 square miles, ﬁve times
the land area of Britain, though half of it is desert.
In the Middle East (not counting Pakistan orTurkey) only Egypt has as large a population.Given Iran’s size, its oil resources and popula-tion, the heritage of an ancient civilisation and the
history of a once great Persian Empire, its rulers
might understandably dream of making theircountry a great power once more. But Iran(known as Persia until it was renamed in 1935)
had ﬁrst to free itself from foreign domination.
The oil and Iran’s strategic position on the path
to India had encouraged Britain to dominate
southern Persia and the Gulf, agreeing to a divi-sion of interests that left Russia dominant in thenorth. Never genuinely independent, the country
was occupied once more in 1941 by British and
Russian troops for fear that the Shah would throw
in his lot with the Germans. He was forced toabdicate and his son succeeded him.During the post-war years the nationalistmovement led by Mossadeq tried to win true
independence and to loosen the control of the
British oil giants over the country’s main
resource. The British government resisted andthere was new turmoil, which was brought to anend in 1953 with the help once more of foreign
intervention. The Americans and British helped
the Shah to oust Mossadeq and the nationalist
politicians and to stage a coup. In the eyes of thenationalists the Shah now owed his authority toforeign intervention, thus further diminishing
Iran’s sovereignty and independence. In 1955
Iran joined the Western alliance – the Baghdad462THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80
Pact (renamed the Central Treaty Organisationafter Iraq’s revolution in 1958 and its subsequentdeparture), characterising the Shah still more 
as a lackey of the Anglo-American ‘imperialists’.
Iranian nationalist fervour could never reconcile
itself to the ‘Western’ Shah.Yet the Shah, though he owed his assumptionof real power to American and British assistance in
1953, had every intention of asserting Iran’s inde-
pendence and creating a military base for new
greatness. As his rule grew increasingly dictatorial,
he appointed Iran’s parliament and imprisonedpoliticians if they showed any sign of opposition.He established the National Information and
Security Organisation, known as SAVAK, a secu-
rity police that collected information on oppo-
nents, often imprisoning, torturing and evenmurdering them. American attempts to inﬂuencethe Shah and to persuade him to introduce demo-
cratic reforms, using economic and military aid 
as levers, had little effect. The Shah made token
gestures in response. Western diplomats were byno means ignorant of the Shah’s misrule, or of thecorruption of the court and its dependants, but 
in Washington and London no alternative policy
to supporting the Shah was acceptable. If a 
revolution should topple the Shah’s regime, the
country’s mass poverty would, so it was thought,lead to a seizure of power by radicals and commu-nists. The disturbed state of the Middle East 
had already allowed the Soviet Union to establish
bases in Syria and Yemen; Iraq was uncertain and
Egypt unstable. So Iran was the bulwark protect-ing the West’s vital interests in the Persian Gulf.What the West did not foresee was the Islamic 
revolution.The public in the West was given a positiveimage of the Shah. The handsome ruler seated on
his aptly named Peacock throne in beautiful uni-
forms looked every inch a royal and made it easy toforget that his father, a dashing cavalry ofﬁcer, had

seized power in 1921 to become the founder of
the Pahlavi ‘dynasty’. The lack of blue blood was
compensated for by pomp and circumstance,which reached the height of folly when in 1971 theShah staged a sumptuous celebration attended by
international dignitaries to mark the anniversary of
‘two and a half millennia’ of the Persian Empire.The pageant, staged to impress the visitors atPersepolis, ancient capital of the Achaemeniankings of Persia, cost tens of millions of dollars and
was televised worldwide. Nevertheless, he was
regarded as a ﬁrm friend of the West and as a

reformer who was dragging his people out of the darkness of ignorance and prejudice into themodern age.As a reformer his record was ﬂawed. Authori-
tarian and careless of political and human rights,
the Shah resorted to brutal repression to preserve
his power. In the early 1960s when the Americanswere pressing for reforms, the economy was running into trouble and the National Front 
politicians were growing in strength, the Shah
responded by arresting the National Front leaders
and, in 1963, organised a national referendum ona comprehensive reform package. It included landreform, a new election law including women’s 
suffrage, a national literacy corps, proﬁt-sharing

and the sale of factories to private industry. The
reforms were supposed to establish the Shah as a popular leader and were presented as the Shah–People Revolution. The referendum was rigged.The most formidable opposition now camefrom religious leaders and their followers, and for
the ﬁrst time the name of one of these, Ruhollah
Khomeini, was heard. Students were killed whenparatroopers attacked the religious school of Qomwhere he taught and preached. His re-arrest in
June 1963 sparked off an insurrection in Teheran
and other towns. The Shah ordered troops and
tanks to shoot on the demonstrators and declaredmartial law. The number killed has never beenaccurately established: the Shah’s government
claimed less than a hundred, but other witnesses
speak of thousands. Thousands more were impris-
oned. Ayatollah Khomeini was released, but after
persisting with his opposition he was, in 1964 atthe age of sixty-two, forced to leave Iran. It turnedout to be the Shah’s worst mistake. From his exile
successively in Turkey, Iraq and Paris, Khomeini
was able to send a stream of clandestine propa-
ganda into Iran, uncompromisingly condemningthe Shah as an American lackey and his efforts tomodernise and Westernise the country as contrary
to Islamic law. By the end of his ﬁfteen years of
exile Khomeini was recognised by the masses as1THE STRUGGLE FOR PREDOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST463
the spiritual and political leader who was mosteffectively challenging the Shah’s ﬁtness to rule.In Iran, the Shah kept a tight grip on the coun-try, backed by the military forces on which he 
lavished money and by SAVAK. He spent a quar-
ter of Iran’s income on purchasing the latestweapons, tanks and planes from the US, thoughthe US administration and Congress were reluc-
tant to gratify all his wishes. The huge increase in
oil revenues, especially after the price rises of
1973, gave the Shah the dollars with which to
purchase whatever caught his fancy. The West,meanwhile, was tempted to reduce the imbalanceof trade caused by the high cost of oil by selling all
it could to Iran and the Middle Eastern oil states
– who placed arms high on their shopping lists.Successive development plans imposed reformsfrom above. Land reform deprived absentee land-lords of most of their land and more than doubled
the number of peasant proprietors of smallhold-
ings. Large agricultural cooperatives were formed,
and tractors and fertilisers used. But, as in theSoviet Union, it proved exceedingly difﬁcult toimprove agricultural productivity, which contin-
ued to rise more slowly than the increase in popu-
lation. The government official replaced the
landlord as the peasant’s boss. Industrial growth,
from a low base, was more impressive. New factor-ies, steel mills and assembly plants for motor vehicles were constructed. Education and health
services also benefited from large investments, 
and many Iranian students were sent abroad 
to Western universities. The statistics reﬂect a
remarkable economic development; what they donot reveal is the unevenness of the distribution of
wealth and the social dislocation that these rapid
changes produced. The gulf between the privi-leged elites – higher army ofﬁcers, administratorsand leading merchants – and the masses of urbanpoor, farmers and labourers remained huge. In the
northern parts of Teheran, the shops, hotels and
ofﬁces catered to the rich and exuded wealth. To
the south lay a different world of slums wheremost of the city’s 4.5 million lived in abject con-ditions. Many peasants had migrated to Teheran
and to other towns, where they turned to the mul-
lahs and the mosques for spiritual guidance and
self-respect. In the countryside the income of
three-quarters of rural families was so low thatmalnutrition was widespread. Nor was the smallbut growing middle class reconciled to the Shah’s
authoritarian regime. For thousands of students
no worthwhile prospects awaited them on gradu-
ation. All sections of society had reasons to resentthe Shah’s rule. Yet the speedy weakening of hisposition, leading to his overthrow in January
1979, came as a surprise.Despite criticisms of Iran’s violations of thedemocratic process and of human rights, the USstill felt that the Shah’s regime was the best guar-antor of Western interests in the Persian Gulf.
After the British withdrawal as protecting power
of the Gulf sheikhdoms in 1971, the Shah with
his well-equipped army and air force of some
350,000 men came to be seen as the indispens-able policeman of a potentially turbulent region.President Jimmy Carter, who entered the White
House in January 1977, shrank from criticising
the regime publicly, despite the prominence he
gave to human rights. In November 1977 whenthe Shah visited Washington, with tear gaswafting around the White House lawn from
protest demonstrations beyond the gate, Carter
fulsomely pledged US support. On his return visit
to Teheran in December he praised the Shah in
a New Year toast. ‘Iran’, he declared:is an island of stability in one of the more trou-bled areas in the world. ... This is a great

tribute to you, Your Majesty, and to your lead-
ership and to the respect, admiration and lovewhich your people give to you.Carter’s support was to cost him dear when theShah’s opponents came to power.464THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80

In the West few in authority could imaginehow the Shah, at the head of armed forces whichowed him everything, could fail to crush any
popular protests likely to arise. The Shah could
also count on an upper echelon of society who
derived their wealth from his economic develop-ment and his favours. Ignorance of the dynamicsof Iranian society led Western analysts to under-
estimate the hold of the mullahs over the people
and the unrelenting sense of mission of an 
exiled ayatollah in a Parisian suburb. When the
television cameras paid attention to AyatollahKhomeini, all they showed was an old man in his seventies sitting cross-legged on a carpet. He
commanded no army, no government in exile, yet
he proved more powerful than the Shah.How did the revolution come about? From themid-1970s, the Iranian economy did not prosper,despite the large oil income. The oil-price rise of
1973–4 was causing recession in the West and a
drop in demand. The consequence was inﬂation,
of food prices particularly; these price rises weremost severe for the poor, whose rents in Teheransoared at the same time. Carter had hardly left
Teheran early in January 1978 before demonstra-
tions on behalf of Khomeini began in the holy
city of Qom. The Shah responded ﬁercely; police
opened ﬁre on the students, some of whom werekilled, the ﬁrst martyrs of the revolution. Fromthen on protests escalated in other cities and in
Teheran in March, May and August 1978.
Moderates and radicals, the National Front politi-
cians, clerics and merchants were comingtogether to bring the Shah’s personal rule to anend. In September a large demonstration con-
verged on Jaleh Square in Teheran. The Shah
imposed martial law. When the crowds would not
disperse, the army started ﬁring indiscriminately.
Estimates of the ensuing casualties varied betweenseveral hundreds and 2,000. It was a turningpoint. Strikes spread throughout the country.The revolution was an example of peoplepower, the ﬁrst of several, to be followed later in
the 1980s in South Korea, in the Philippines andin Eastern Europe, where the mass of people pre-vailed over the firepower of the military and
police. The majority of the Shah’s soldiers were
conscripts, sickened by the orders to shootdefenceless civilians; some joined the protesters.Rallying around posters of Khomeini, the accept-ed leader of the masses, the people engaged in a
righteous struggle against their oppressive ruler.
The Shah, uncertain whether to send in more
troops or to try to negotiate with the moderates,lost control.By December 1978, when the US administra-tion was urging the Shah to accept a constitu-
tional monarchy, it was too late. On 16 January
1979 the Shah left the country without formally
abdicating, and his departure released an out-pouring of joy on the streets of Teheran. In theaftermath, no matter who managed temporarily
to gain power in Iran’s government, there was
only one leader who really counted and that was
the Ayatollah Khomeini. On 1 February 1979television screens around the world showed himslowly descending from an Air France plane to a
delirious reception from the crowds.1THE STRUGGLE FOR PREDOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST465
Iran, February 1979. The return of the AyatollahKhomeini from exile in Paris opens a new era ofreligious fervour. © Bettmann/CorbisThe ﬁrst few months of the revolution weregrim. Khomeini, the undisputed leader, chose alayman, Mehdi Bazargan, to head the provisional
Islamic government. Bazargan was an Islamic
scholar and had been an opponent of the Shah’s
authoritarian rule. Power was divided. Revolu-
tionary courts sentenced and executed generals ofthe Shah’s army responsible for the repression. By
mid-March sixty-eight leading supporters of the
Shah had been executed. On 1 April Khomeini
declared the establishment of the Islamic Republic,
which had been endorsed by a referendum. Realpower lay with the Islamic Revolutionary Council,which took its orders from Khomeini. To ‘protect
the revolution’ Khomeini sanctioned the forma-

tion of a militia, the Islamic Republican Party. The
army and civil service were purged of those whohad supported the Shah’s regime, and attempts byKurdish and Arab minorities to take advantage of
the turmoil in order to set out on their own path
to independence were put down. Thus was the rev-

olution made secure.Khomeini blamed the Americans for all Iran’sills and for their support of the Shah’s corrupt
regime, and he aroused the masses to see in the
US the main danger to the revolution’s success
and Iran’s independence. Washington’s efforts to
establish normal relations were rejected. Bowingto humanitarian pressures, President Carter per-mitted the mortally sick Shah to receive medicaltreatment in New York. The Iranian governmentdemanded his extradition to face charges in Iran.Khomeini supported these demands, urging the
Teheran students to widen their attacks against
America and Israel. There followed in November
1979 the seizure of the American Embassy by arevolutionary student group and the taking of theAmerican diplomats and secretaries as hostages.
Prime Minister Bazargan resigned and the Islamic
Revolutionary Council took charge of the govern-
ment. The US became the Great Satan. The revo-
lution was radicalised and for fourteen months thehostages remained imprisoned. Carter’s attemptin April 1980 to rescue them by sending a special
task force secretly to Teheran misﬁred when three
of the eight helicopters developed malfunctions;
the raid was aborted but unfortunately two of therescuing planes crashed on making ready toreturn, killing eight men; the mission could not
any longer be kept secret. The impact on Carter’s
electoral chances was devastating. Khomeini had
demonstrated that Iran could safely defy the US.Not until the day Carter left the White Housewere the hostages released to ﬂy home. By then
Iran had already been at war for four months with
its neighbour Iraq. It was the beginning of the
devastating Gulf War that lasted for almost seven
years and led to the death of a million young menon both sides, the bloodiest conﬂict of the MiddleEast in modern times.466THE ENDING OF EUROPEAN DOMINANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, 1919–80

THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER
CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
Stalin never trusted the West, though he did notanticipate any immediate Western aggression. The
orthodoxy still persisted in his day that capitalism
would never tolerate communism and that a clashbetween the two worlds was historically inevitable.The deplorable state of the Soviet Union after the
Second World War, however, made a postpone-
ment of any new conﬂict the highest priority of
Soviet policy. This meant avoiding extreme provo-
cations of the West, maintaining as long as possi-ble the cooperation of the wartime alliance. Itinvolved resisting Western moves dangerous to
the security of the Soviet Union, above all the
reviving and rearming of Germany. It was equally
essential, Stalin believed, that despite the need forreconstruction and the poverty of the Russianpeople the armed forces should be kept strong and
that nuclear and missile developments should be
continued. The Soviet Union had to avoid appear-
ing vulnerable and the Red Army had to maintain
its grip on Eastern and central Europe, whereuncertain allies acted as buffers. Given this pes-simistic global outlook the prospects of building
up conﬁdence and allaying Soviet suspicions were
never very good. There seemed to be a glimmer of
hope in 1945 and 1946 after the defeat of NaziGermany, but Western demands that the SovietUnion pull back to its redrawn frontiers and per-
mit the countries of central and Eastern Europe a
free choice of government – demands justiﬁed
from a Western point of view by the agreementsreached at Yalta, and by Western values – alarmedStalin. Soviet security rested now, in his view, onSoviet military dominance in Eastern and central
Europe: Western demands, if fully acted on,
would only recreate a line of hostile states alongSoviet borders.Stalin did attempt to compromise initially byholding a loose rein (according to Soviet, not
Western, standards) in Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria and Romania, where he did not insist on
the establishment of one-party communist gov-ernments and permitted freedoms unthinkable inthe Soviet Union at the time. He kept out of the
Greek Civil War, and provided no encouragement
to communist parties in Western Europe, though
they were especially strong in Italy and France.According to Soviet perceptions, this moderationhad not paid any dividends. The West showed no
appreciation of Russia’s losses and sacriﬁces during
the Second World War, even going so far as to halt
reparations from the Western zones of Germany.The reconstruction of the Western zones ofGermany was viewed by Stalin with the deepestsuspicion. The failure of an East–West agreement
over the future of Germany was a crucially import-
ant reason for the start of the Cold War. The
nightmare of new German armies in a capitalistcoalition haunted Stalin. The Truman Doctrineand Marshall Aid were seen as further evidence of
implacable Western hostility, of a grand design to
revivify former enemies and to undermine the
hold an economically weakened Soviet Unionheld over its satellites. Finally, Britain and the US1Chapter 42THE RISE OF KHRUSHCHEVTHE SOVIET UNION AND THE WESTwould not share their nuclear secrets with theRussians except on terms that were totally unac-ceptable, and they maintained a stockpile of
atomic bombs as a threat to the Soviet Union.American and British secret services wereindeed planning clandestinely to roll back theSoviet control of Eastern Europe. From 1949until the early 1950s there was, for instance, a
bizarre scheme to restore King Zog to the throne
of Albania; this, it was hoped, might start a wave
of hostility against pro-Russian governments in
the Balkans. Albanian exiles were actually landed,but they were quickly rounded up and shot.Several operations were nevertheless conducted
over a period of some years, but none had any
chance of success. This was not surprising, since
British spies in high places in the Foreign Ofﬁceand the Secret Intelligence Services (MI6) werepassing information about these operations to
Moscow. They had been recruited by the KGB as
far back as the 1930s for just such a role. In the
Baltic too in the 1950s, there was guerrilla resis-tance in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, whoseindependence had been snuffed out by the Soviet
Union in 1940. After the war, MI6 organised the
return of Latvian and Lithuanian émigrés to
encourage uprisings. They were betrayed, met by
the KGB and executed or imprisoned. It was inany event unlikely that any nationalist uprisings,even if they could have been organised by these
missions, would have provoked any other Soviet
reaction but bloody suppression.Stalin blundered when he tried to intimidatethe West to give way in Germany during theBerlin crisis and the blockade in 1948. His overall
German policy, as well as Soviet harshness in
Eastern Europe, was even more calamitously
counter-productive, for it led to the formation of
a ﬁrm Western alliance, NATO, and eventually tothe rearmament of West Germany. Any chance ofestablishing Soviet–Western relations on a fresh
basis had certainly, if ever possible, been lost by
1948.From the Kremlin’s point of view, Russia facedthree overriding challenges in the post-war world.There was the perceived external threat from
Western capitalist hostility to communism; there
was the unwillingness of the majority of thepeople of Eastern and central Europe to accept,unless imposed by Soviet-backed force, the communist transformation of their society and
economy; and ﬁnally there was the danger that a
greater awareness of Western standards of life
would create dissatisfaction among the Russianpeople, who had been conditioned into believingthat they were building up a better and more 
just society. Stalin, moreover, realised that in 
the aftermath of the war the Soviet Union, with
its Western territories devastated, was in an
appallingly weak state and that to provide forsecurity and reconstruction would demand oncemore heavy sacriﬁces from the Russian people.In Eastern and central Europe the Sovietsimposed a communist minority on the majority,
and this minority then faced strong popular opposition to its social and economic policies, aswell as the opposition of the Catholic Church,
which retained the adherence of the majority of
Poles and Hungarians. To this opposition was
added the ﬁerce nationalism of these peoples –the one characteristic they shared, whether Poles,Yugoslavs or Albanians. Only the Yugoslavs and
Albanians had escaped direct Soviet control.
Elsewhere the leaders of the satellite communist
regimes soon set up by Stalin, the ‘little Stalins’,
were not only hated but were regarded by theirown people as puppets of their Soviet masters. Allthis discontent within the Soviet sphere of power
was a source of instability. It would need little to
transform it into open revolt, even without
Western assistance. The very existence of the Weston the borders of the extended Soviet empire wasa provocation, irrespective of Western policies.The inherent problems of ruling over theSoviet Union itself presented the gravest problems
to the isolated communist elite. The war against
the Germans had revealed strong nationalist feel-ings in the Ukraine and elsewhere and much dis-affection in the face of Stalinist rule. On the other
hand, the horrors of German occupation and
national fervour had also helped to unite the
peoples of the USSR. Signiﬁcantly, the war cameto be known not as the great communist struggleagainst capitalism in its fascist manifestation, but
as the Great Patriotic War, thus emphasising the
nationalism and patriotism which transcended the470THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
revolution and the Soviet state. With the war over,how could the harshness of communist rule fromabove continue to be justiﬁed? The hostile West
was painted in the blackest colours.While Stalin lived he ensured that no one elsehad a power base to rival his. Even so, the SovietUnion was not a monolithic society. Stalin couldintervene arbitrarily, but control lower down the
scale had to be left to others, to Beria’s secret
police and to the tens of thousands of func-

tionaries in the police, party and governmental
apparatus who administered the Soviet republics.By changing his top henchmen, killing suspectsand those who showed any signs of independ-
ence, by ﬁlling the prison camps of the Gulag and
by promoting for a time those he trusted, Stalin’s
hold remained unshakeable to his dying day.As Stalin’s health deteriorated after the war,political repression became more ﬁerce. News-

papers and magazines parroted the party view. In
science, drama, history, literature, art, even in
music, the party line had to be followed. Stalinshortly before his death was preparing anothergreat purge to safeguard his power and to maintain
the system. The Doctor’s Plot was unveiled in
January 1953. It had strong (and popular) anti-
Semitic overtones. The startling public announce-

ment was made that nine doctors, all but twoJewish, who had looked after top Soviet leaders,had been arrested a few weeks earlier and had con-

fessed to murdering Zhdanov and other members
of the Soviet elite; they were accused of having
acted on orders from Israeli Zionists and theAmerican and British secret services. Jews inprominent positions were particular targets of the
thousands of arrests that followed. How little
decades of loyalty to Stalin counted was evidenced
by the arrest of Foreign Minister Molotov’s wife,
who was Jewish. Fortunately for many, Stalin suf-
fered a stroke and died in his dacha on 5 March1953, the scared Politburo members tiptoeing to
his room, when they heard, to make sure he was
really dead.The leader who had shaped Russia’s destiniesfor good and evil had unexpectedly gone. Despitehis crimes, Stalin was widely admired as one of the
Soviet Union’s greatest men, second only to
Lenin – Lenin’s ‘comrade-in-arms’, ‘the standardbearer of his genius and his cause’, as the eulogiesafter his death declared. He had ruled the SovietUnion with an iron ﬁst, responsible for the deaths
of millions but also for gigantic material achieve-
ments. Men and women in their prime of life,
indeed everyone under the age of forty-ﬁve, hadknown no adult life except under Stalin. TheSoviet Union had become powerful and respected
in the world and, during the Great Patriotic War,
which was the central event of their lives, Stalin
had saved his country from defeat and had then
presided over the victory of the Red Army and itsﬁnal entry into Berlin. There followed an unprece-dented expansion of Soviet power, and even a
small but steady improvement in living standards
from 1948 to his death. He dwarfed those Soviet
political leaders who survived him. And even they,as Khrushchev recalls, dreaded what seemed anuncertain future without him, although the
shadow of his terror was lifted from their lives.The Russia Stalin had helped to shape and hadnow left behind was a state stiﬂed by bureaucracywithout the safeguards of civil liberties, where all
apparatchiks, whether in politics or industry,
uncritically obeyed the orders of superiors. The
system made each individual play for safety, shel-
tering under the decision of the man above ratherthan risking personal initiative. What mattered waswho would cover you, look after you and provide
you with the advantages and bribes earned by per-
forming a service for the system. Corruption was
endemic. The command economy was firmlyestablished with all its inefﬁciencies, which becameglaringly obvious thirty years after Stalin’s death.
Stalin shamelessly exploited the vested interests he
had created. In the Kremlin those who served him
had to pander to his whims and adapt to his erratic
lifestyle of working into the small hours, drinkingor watching his favourite ﬁlms. His popular imagewas that of the benevolent father of his people, the
fount of all wisdom, whose actions, like those of a
demi-god, could not always be comprehended by
ordinary mortals.Stalin never ofﬁcially designated a successor. Inhis lifetime he had to appear irreplaceable. In this
respect, history seemed to be repeating itself.
Lenin, the father of the Soviet Union, had had1THE RISE OF KHRUSHCHEV471
mixed feelings about his possible successor andappeared to leave an unﬁllable vacuum, but theleadership was nevertheless replaced by three
Bolshevik leaders before Stalin emerged as dicta-
tor and eliminated his rivals. After Stalin’s death
a collective leadership again emerged; not one ofthese once loyal henchmen of Stalin’s day waspowerful enough to oust his rivals immediately.
Power depended on the support of the other
leading Bolsheviks, as well as on the backing of a
constituency, the will not of the people of course,
but of the government in terms of the adminis-tration and economic and industrial managementof the state, or of the party which had once con-
stituted the supreme constituency, or of the sep-
arately organised secret police, its armed units and
prison regimes which controlled a labour force ofseveral millions. Finally there existed the con-
stituency of the Red Army command; though its
broader political ambitions were carefully con-

trolled by the party its support was important to
any aspirant to power.Stalin had dominated Russia without using anyone channel of control exclusively, so that at the
time of his death it was uncertain where power
lay, or rather how it was distributed in the
absence of an autocratic final arbiter. Georgi
Malenkov had presented the main report to theparty Congress in October 1952, which was pos-sibly Stalin’s way of indicating that he was his
choice as successor. Beria, as secret police chief,
had served Stalin faithfully and ruthlessly, too
ruthlessly for the other claimants not to fear him.Molotov had seen long service since the revolu-tion of 1917 and had held important offices,
including that of an unsmiling unbending foreign
minister. Finally Nikita Khrushchev had served
Stalin loyally in the party during and after the war,
accommodating himself to Stalin’s purges.Malenkov was unable to establish himself as soleleader. But the struggle for power was hidden
from the outside world. The premiership, or lead-
ership of the government, was assumed by
Malenkov. Khrushchev became secretary of theCentral Committee of the party. Other leadingcommunists gained control of the different min-
istries which their Stalinist experience appeared to
entitle them to: Molotov foreign affairs, Bulganindefence and Beria interior and security. Thesethree were members of the Politburo, which alsoincluded Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Mikoyan,
Voroshilov and two others, and was presided over
by Malenkov. The ﬁrst outcome of the power
struggle was that Beria was isolated. Only a fewweeks after being accorded an honoured place asa pallbearer of Stalin’s cofﬁn, Beria was secretly
arrested, tried and shot. The ﬁrst public aware-
ness of his fall was his omission from a news
report about leading communists attending a per-
formance at the Bolshoi Theatre. This became thestuff on which a new political science came to bebuilt, Kremlinology. The inner workings of the
Politburo remained shrouded in secrecy before
the Gorbachev era, so Kremlinologists had to
make do with more oblique indications of con-ﬂict and changes in the distribution of power: theline-up of leaders at the May Day parade, the pri-
orities evident at receptions, disappearances from
view, an absence due to a ‘cold’.During the months that followed Stalin’sdeath several important changes occurred. Theparty recovered step by step its former pre-
eminence. Stalin’s personal dictatorship, it was
now claimed, had distorted the correct line laid
down by Lenin. What was being afﬁrmed was the
eternal validity of communist ideology. The con-demnation of Stalin’s rule, by Khrushchev, didnot indicate at this stage a loss of faith in com-
munism itself.In the spring and summer of 1953 the collec-tive leadership’s first priority was to maintaincontrol. The army had been a powerful allyagainst Beria and, if the terror machine was not
to be relied on to the same extent as before,
control might better be established by conces-
sions. A cautious beginning was made of releas-
ing some of the tens of thousands who had beenfalsely imprisoned. Malenkov lowered prices andallowed more resources to be devoted to con-
sumer goods. To ease food shortages, the peas-
ants were promised a better deal, prices paid by
the state for agricultural produce were increasedand taxes reduced. Khrushchev took charge of theagriculture – the key to better living standards –
and launched the development of the ‘virgin
lands’, a vast scheme to grow grain on lands in472THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
the remoter regions of the Soviet Union not pre-viously cultivated because they were subject todroughts or other unfavourable conditions. It was
a crash programme that produced spectacular
results between 1953 and 1956. Later results
proved disappointing.As always the Soviet leadership faced the prob-
lem of how to stretch inadequate resources to pro-

vide for policies each of which was highly desirable
in itself: more investment in agriculture, a switch,
even if a modest one, from heavy to consumer
industries, and full support for the military estab-
lishment and defence. One conclusion reached wasthat an openly aggressive policy towards the US
and its allies, such as Stalin had followed in 1948
and 1949, would only cement the anti-Soviet
alliances and lead to increased Western rearma-
ment, so widening the gap between the West andthe Soviet Union even if Soviet defence expendi-

ture were greatly increased. Soviet relations with
the rest of the world therefore followed a calmer
course. But the West must not be left with theimpression that the opportunity now existed toundermine Soviet control of Eastern and central
Europe, which was fundamental to the Soviet
Union’s perception of its continued security. So a
tightrope had to be walked between concession
and ﬁrmness. Despite debate on each issue of pol-
icy, and political rivalries, a surprisingly consistentline of policy emerged from 1953 until 1956.In April 1953, only a month after Stalin’s death,the Soviet Union used its inﬂuence to help bring

the Korean War to a conclusion. Next, it was indi-
cated that a peace treaty might be possible forAustria. But, to hold the balance, emphasis was
placed on the continuity of Soviet policy: there
would be no withdrawal from Eastern Europe. The
point was underlined when Soviet tanks suppressed
disorders in Berlin which threatened to turn into ageneral uprising against an unpopular Stalinistregime. But in the summer of 1953 further
friendly signals were sent. An American journalist
in Prague who had been imprisoned as a spy two
years previously was released, and Malenkov deliv-
ered a speech in which he declared that there wereno problems that could not be settled by negotia-

tion. To satisfy the hardliners these ‘new’ views
were interspersed with classic Stalinist declarationsas well. Actions, however, indicated the newapproach more clearly: the resumption of diplo-
matic relations with Greece, with Israel and even
with Stalin’s sworn enemy, Tito’s Yugoslavia.
Conciliatory statements were made to improve
relations in the Middle East with Turkey and Iran.In the spring of 1954, the Soviet Union and Chinaparticipated with Britain and France in the Geneva
Conference, which reached a settlement relating to
the French Indo-China War. The largest and most
unexpected concession the Russians made was to
conclude the long-drawn-out negotiations overAustria by agreeing to withdraw from the Sovietzone and from Vienna, which they did tactfully to
the strains of the Radetzky March. The Austrian
Treaty was signed on 15 May 1955. A new epoch
in East–West relations appeared to have beenachieved two months later at a conference of theBig Four (the US, the Soviet Union, Britain and
France), also held in Geneva. Although far-reach-

ing disarmament proposals by both sides got
nowhere and no real progress was made on anysubstantive issue, the friendly human contactbetween the Soviet leaders – Khrushchev clearly
emerging as Russia’s decisive voice in foreign
affairs – and President Eisenhower created an illu-

sory feeling that a new era was about to start. The
Cold War looked like being liquidated. Even so,Soviet policy failed in one of its main objectives: to prevent the rearming of Western Europe in gen-

eral and of Western Germany in particular. Nor 
did the relaxation of tension sufﬁciently encourage

the West to abandon NATO and to dissolve theWestern European–North American military life-
line. Suspicions of the Soviet Union ran too deep,
Soviet military power in Europe was too over-

whelming to tempt France, Britain and the Federal
Republic of Germany to exchange the American
alliance for Soviet promises of peaceful coexistenceand some form of German reuniﬁcation.
The decision to withdraw from Austria coincidedwith the fall of Malenkov in February 1955.
Foreign relations were one of the issues in theinternal power struggle among the Soviet leader-ship in the Politburo (or rather in the Praesidium,
as the Politburo was renamed from 1952 to
1966). Khrushchev was prepared to go further1THE RISE OF KHRUSHCHEV473
than Malenkov and Molotov in improving rela-tions with the West, with China and withYugoslavia. Malenkov also proved himself indeci-
sive and slow-witted in the face of Khrushchev’s
ruthless manoeuvring. Khrushchev had pro-
gressed since Stalin’s death from being the mostsenior secretary to ﬁrst secretary of the party.
Unlike Beria, who was executed, Malenkov was
bloodlessly demoted and remained a member of
the Praesidium. Khrushchev nevertheless contin-
ued to be fettered by the collective leadership of
the Praesidium, where hardliners like Molotovhad only been temporarily eclipsed. On no onewould Stalin’s mantle of absolute power fall.
Khrushchev was not yet strong enough to
combine the position of head of the government
with that of party chief, so Bulganin replacedMalenkov as premier.But Khrushchev was riding high. A man ofgreat energy, he displayed a down-to-earth bluff-
ness, despising formality and protocol; what he
lacked in consistency and steady application ofcarefully prepared policies, he made up for inboldness. He tried to cut through the stultifying
dead weight of state bureaucracy by making a per-
sonal and human impact, quite unlike the aloof-
ness and austerity of the Stalinist period, and by
pragmatism, trying first one way and thenanother. He was convinced that the governingleadership had to win more popular consent, to
persuade and cajole, and to minimise the use of
state force. With Russia’s backward agriculture
lacking incentives, Khrushchev again raised pricesof agricultural products, increased investments infarm machinery and fertilisers and extended the
virgin lands. More state farms, run like industrial
enterprises, were established as the virgin lands
were opened up. An impressive rise in agricultural
output was achieved, though at a high cost inresources, and agricultural productivity remainedlow by comparison with advanced countries like
the US, even if a more favourable comparison
could be made with the less efﬁcient small French
or southern German farms. As in Soviet industry,over-centralisation of planning led to much wasteand inefﬁciency.Less hidebound by ideology in the narrowsense, Khrushchev was ready to try new remedies.He nevertheless held to the central tenet ofStalinist ideology that ultimately the Soviet Unionhad to be ruled from above not only politically
but with regard to the determination of economic
priorities and paths of development. The differ-
ence between the Stalinist and the post-Stalinistperiod lies in Khrushchev’s genuine effort tomake communism work for the people to give
them a better quality of life. That was the purpose
of economic and social reform: attempts were
made to alleviate the extreme shortage of housing
and to provide minimum wages; workers werefree to change their jobs; at least some basic legalrights for the ordinary citizen began to emerge;
but the most remarkable change of all was the
massive release of political prisoners from the
Gulag, which began only after Malenkov’s fall.This was the most visible indication of the endingof Stalin’s mass terror regime, though the leader-
ship would continue to protect the system against
individuals who were thought to endanger it, by
imposing sentences of imprisonment, exile ormore subtly, in later years, detention in psychi-atric hospitals. Rights were granted only to those
ready to work within the system, not to those
who were accused of actively propagating views
against it. Thus censorship remained, though it
was less stiﬂing: criticisms of speciﬁc features ofSoviet life were tolerated, writers and artists couldbreathe more freely, and foreign visitors to the
Soviet Union were encouraged. But neither
Khrushchev nor his communist successors ever
granted anything like the freedoms ordinarypeople in the West enjoy.A Soviet citizen could not leave the countrywithout the most careful scrutiny of their past,
even when visiting a fraternal communist Eastern-
bloc state; visits to the West were generally per-
mitted only to members of ofﬁcial delegationsaccompanied by a KGB minder; other members ofthe family had to stay behind as hostages, and
wives were not allowed to join husbands. The fate
of Soviet Jews who wished to emigrate to Israel
was particularly harsh, given that it was forbiddento make a declaration of allegiance to anything butthe Communist Party and Soviet state. National-
ism continued to be suppressed. The Orthodox
Church was one symbol of national consciousness474THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
and was kept under rigid control. Zionism wastreated as ideologically hostile to the state – mereJewish descent ofﬁcially was not – and the teaching

of Hebrew and of Jewish culture was prohibited.
Punishments were harsh. Attempts to stamp out
the corruption widespread in the system involvedthe imposition of death sentences for large-scalefraud or transgression against economic laws.Khrushchev’s ﬁrst move after forcing Malen-kov’s fall with the support of Bulganin and
Voroshilov in February 1955 was to discredit his
opponents in the Praesidium. In the winter of1954–5 he had argued that in the dangerousinternational circumstances of the time Malenkov
was wrong to espouse light consumer industries
at the expense of the heavy industry needed for
defence. Molotov could hardly dispute that. Afew months later Khrushchev turned to attackMolotov’s inﬂexible stance on foreign relations.
Yugoslavia became the touchstone of Soviet
policy and the key to the making of a complete
break with Stalinism, a repudiation that Molotovresisted. Molotov had been ready to re-establishformal diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia as
between two nations, but he was not prepared to
accept that the party could agree to a reconcilia-
tion with a nationalist Yugoslav Communist
Party. Khrushchev prevailed and headed a Sovietdelegation which visited Belgrade in May 1955.This public Soviet acceptance of Tito’s right to
follow his own nationalist path to communism
without having to accept Soviet leadership was
like the mountain coming to Mohammed.At the plenum of the Central Committee ofthe Communist Party in Moscow held in secret
in July 1955, it came to a showdown between
Khrushchev and Molotov. Khrushchev’s argu-

ments were powerful. The Soviet Union had to
avoid a conﬂict with the West, but opportunitiesexisted in the uncommitted underdevelopedcountries, which could be won over to the social-
ist camp. Khrushchev thus recognised that there
were independent nations which, while not
willing to accept Soviet leadership, could be en-couraged to follow policies friendly to the SovietUnion. At the same time, the splits in the 
Soviet bloc, with Yugoslavia and China, should 
be healed as far as possible. Molotov argued forthe more traditional line of policy that tocondone Tito’s break away from the control ofthe Soviet party would only endanger the Soviet
position in the other people’s democracies such
as Poland. But before this crucial meeting had
ended, Molotov had to admit to errors – for thetime being he could not resist Khrushchev’s lineof policy. But Khrushchev was not yet powerful
enough to oust him, the most senior of Stalin’s
lieutenants still surviving in power.Almost as sensational as Khrushchev’s visit toBelgrade was West German Chancellor KonradAdenauer’s visit to Moscow in September 1955.Adenauer had taken the German Federal Republic
into NATO and had refused to recognise the
German Democratic Republic (East Germany) as
sovereign, claiming to speak for the whole ofGermany. The two issues he raised in Moscowwere German reunification and the return of
German prisoners of war, and as a result of his visit
the surviving German prisoners of war returned
home. Relations between the Federal Republicand the Soviet Union were normalised as betweentwo sovereign nations. Only a few weeks later in
November and December 1955 Khrushchev and
Bulganin visited India, Burma and Afghanistan, 
to be met everywhere with enthusiasm. To
Afghanistan, in dispute with Pakistan, massiveSoviet military aid was sent, and economic assis-tance was given to India and Burma; only Pakistan
could not be wooed but remained loyal to the
Western Baghdad Pact. On their return to
Moscow it was clear that Khrushchev’s andBulganin’s prestige had risen as a result of theirforeign travels. Khrushchev could claim that
Soviet inﬂuence and security had been enhanced
by the policies he had followed: a rapprochement
with Yugoslavia and China, good relations with
the countries of south-east Asia, a relaxation oftension with Western Europe and, after theGeneva summit of July 1955, with the US as well.
Soviet inﬂuence was on the increase in the neutral
Third World, that is among the ex-colonies of
Western European empires. Finally, the SovietUnion had leapt over the Baghdad Pact in arrang-ing an arms deal with Egypt shortly after the

intended, rather, to create opportunities for theexpansion of Soviet power and inﬂuence withoutrisking war.Khrushchev was riding high in the winter of 1955.At the Twentieth Party Congress, which assembledin February 1956, he now made his boldest bid forleadership, seeking the support of the Soviet party
and government elite in his famous ‘secret speech’.
In it he launched what he believed were artful and
hardly concealed attacks on Molotov, Malenkov
and Kaganovich, his rivals in the Praesidium. Themost sensational part of his speech was his denun-
ciation of Stalin’s despotism, of the crimes Stalin
and his close associates (by implication including
Molotov and Malenkov) had committed, such as
the murder in 1934 of Kirov, the ﬁrst secretary 
of the Leningrad party. Khrushchev graphicallyspoke of the tortures and purges that followed; 
he demythologised Stalin’s image as all-wise,
describing how he had miscalculated in June 1941
when the Germans attacked and how he had com-
pletely lost control for a time. He emphasised howloyal members of the party, the state and the armed
forces had been wrongly arrested and shot. Stalin
had usurped the party; it was not the system or the
party that had been at fault, but Stalin’s lust for
power and his insane suspicions, which becamemurderously manifest in 1934. Khrushchev wascareful not to attack the way the state had evolved
as such after Lenin’s death but placed all the blame
on Stalin and his associates, such as Beria. The
opposition to Khrushchev, led by Molotov, laterdubbed the ‘anti-party’ group, nevertheless sur-
vived until June 1957, when its ﬁnal concerted

challenge failed.In the same sensational speech Khrushchevalso fundamentally redeﬁned the Soviet Union’s
external relations. The world had changed sinceLenin’s day, he declared. War was no longerinevitable. The capitalist imperialists could now
be restrained by powerful social and political
forces, and aggression would receive a smashing
rebuff. The capitalist West would not rapidlydecay, though Khrushchev had no doubts aboutthe ultimate triumph of communism in the world.Meanwhile there could be ‘peaceful coexistence’between countries with different social systems.Khrushchev was anxious to win over the socialist
Third World, especially India with its democratic
constitution, asserting that the socialist transfor-
mation of society need not be achieved by violentrevolutions but could also be brought about byparliamentary institutions. He even hoped to allay
the hostility to communism of the socialist parties
of Western Europe and to help create a united
front of the working class. The Western European
nations were encouraged to dissolve their linkswith the US, whose only purpose was to exploitthem.To further these aims B and K, as they becamepopularly known, continued their travels, visiting
Britain in April 1956. They stayed with theirentourage incongruously at the most aristocraticof London hotels, Claridge’s, and then laid a
wreath on the tomb of Karl Marx. But the visit
was not a success, either publicly or in minister-
ial meetings. The shadow of the Middle Easthung over discussions with the prime minister,Anthony Eden, who blamed the Russians for
encouraging Nasser and unbalancing the Middle
East by supplying the Egyptians with arms via
Czechoslovakia. Khrushchev’s sensational denun-
ciation of Stalin meanwhile was read with aston-ishment and avid interest; the Western worldhoped that Soviet policy would now break with
the past altogether.In Soviet-dominated central and EasternEurope the changes in Soviet policies sinceStalin’s death had spectacular repercussions.Khrushchev’s efforts to make communism more
acceptable to the people, to restrain the arbitrary
abuse of power by the ‘little Stalins’ and by their
subservient party machines, resulted in popular
outbursts and demands for other freedoms theKremlin would not lightly concede: more nationalindependence and a loosening of the Soviet grip.
Paradoxically, the communist leaders in East
Germany, Bulgaria and Romania most disap-

proved of by Khrushchev for their rigid Stalinismwere the ones best able to keep control againstrising nationalism.476THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
Stalin’s Russia was determined to turn Poland intoan obedient Soviet-controlled state; all vestiges of
democratic inﬂuence were to be swept away. A
Tito-like defiance could not be tolerated inPoland, which was strategically far more vital tothe USSR than Yugoslavia. Fearful that the ortho-
dox communist but nationally minded Polish 
ﬁrst secretary of the Communist Party, Wladysav
Gomulka, could cause trouble, Stalin had him
removed and imprisoned. Gomulka’s rival forpower, the president of Poland, Boleslaw Bierut,a former Comintern man, was placed in the crucial
position of ﬁrst secretary. To make doubly certain,
a Soviet general, Marshal Konstanty Rokossowski,
installed as deputy premier and minister ofdefence, ensured that Poland did not stray fromthe Soviet fold. Rokossowski could call on a Polish
army of 400,000 men and on the Soviet divisions
stationed in Poland, which was ruled by the party
rigidly on the Stalinist model. Fears of West
German demands for the recovery of Germany’s‘lost’ territories of Silesia and East Prussia couldbe used to make Poland the most important
member, besides the Soviet Union, of the Warsaw
Pact alliance, which the Russians had set up in
1955 to counter the formation of NATO in theWest. Economically, too, Poland was closelylinked to the Soviet Union through bilateral
treaties. It was also a member of Comecon, the
Soviet-dominated Council of Mutual Economic
Assistance, set up in 1949. In its early yearsComecon hardly bestowed ‘mutual’ beneﬁts onits members but was largely inactive, a propa-ganda answer to Western cooperation and
Marshall Aid.Industry and small workshops were almosttotally nationalised in Poland. The economy wasdirected by a central plan which gave greatest
emphasis to heavy industry and armaments. The
workers suffered from the exploitation of their
labour, and independent trade unions had been
crushed. To these privations, the easiest responseswere absenteeism, petty theft and shoddy work.Thus the Polish socialist state in this command
economy did not win the support of the class on
which communism was supposed to be ﬁrmly

built – the industrial workers. The party tried topush state agriculture too, imposing prices andexacting taxes. Stalinist collectivisation made only
slow progress, however: less than 10 per cent of
arable land had been collectivised by 1955. The
rest remained in the hands of small farmers, but
they were defenceless against rigid state controlsand reacted by producing less and less.The Catholic Church, traditional custodian ofPolish culture, came to embody national inde-
pendence and resistance to communism and
Russiﬁcation. Relations between state and Churchrapidly got worse after 1949; the Church’s privi-leges and possessions were curtailed and in 1952
bishops and priests were arrested and imprisoned.
Then in 1953 the primate of Poland, Archbishop
Stefan Wyszynski, was forced to retire to amonastery.1Chapter 43EASTERN EUROPE AND THE SOVIET UNIONTHE POLISH CHALLENGE AND THEHUNGARIAN RISINGAll these repressive measures failed to breakthe religious feelings of the majority of Poles.Farmers clung to their soil and workers could not
be persuaded to build up a socialist Poland which
offered them so little reward. The bureaucracy,
the secret police and the party were ‘them’, to besuffered only as long as was necessary – and thatmeant, as Poles realised, as long as Soviet military
force held Poland in its grip.Stalin’s death did not lead to any immediatethaw in Poland. Bierut held on to power, though
on Moscow’s insistence ‘collective’ leadership hadto be adopted by splitting the positions of partysecretary and premier. Soon a split developed, as
it had in Moscow, between the Stalinist hardlin-
ers and the reformers, and Bierut was forced into
concessions. Beria’s fall in the Soviet Union haddowngraded in the Soviet Union the previouslyall-powerful security apparatus and limited its
murderous activities. Poland’s regime had to
follow suit. Communists unjustly imprisoned
were rehabilitated and Gomulka was quietlyreleased from prison. Discussion became morefree and critical; even Western jazz could now be
played. The Stalinist years had proved to be no
more than a cloak as far as people’s minds were
concerned: a religious, patriotic and critical pop-
ulation remained very much alive in town andcountry and so showed up the isolation of thePolish communist leadership. Khrushchev’s not
so secret speech to the Twentieth Congress of the
Communist Party in February 1956 denouncing
Stalin was a heavy blow to Bierut and the hard-liners in Poland. Indeed, it may have contributedto the heart attack and death of Bierut in Moscow
a few weeks later.Edward Ochab, formerly a Stalinist, now withthe wind of change from Moscow a more ﬂexible
communist, succeeded as party secretary. He hadturned reformer. Khrushchev’s speech was readout at Communist Party meetings throughout
Poland; a general amnesty released many political
prisoners. Reforms eased the lot of farmers and
workers, but the ﬁrm control of the party madepeople regard talk of ‘democratisation’ with cyn-icism, and the Russians remained ever present.
Yet, three years after Stalin’s death popular pres-
sure from below intensiﬁed in Eastern Europe,fuelled rather than appeased by half-heartedreforms, as it turned into open risings in Hungaryin November 1956. But the most serious crisis
appeared ﬁrst to be occurring in Poland, when in
June 1956 the Poznan steelworkers escalated a
pay dispute into a disturbance of much widersigniﬁcance. They now loudly demanded ‘Breadand Freedom’ and so challenged the whole
Soviet-backed system, though only in peaceful
demonstrations. The authorities reacted with
brute force. Army units ﬁred into the crowds,
killing and wounding more than 300. Poles werekilling Poles. In the aftermath of these events inPoznan the Politburo of the Polish Communist
Party was thrown into confusion by the deep divi-
sion between the Stalinists and the reformers.
According to the Stalinists the Poznan distur-bance was the work of ‘enemy agents’; accordingto reformers it was an expression of legitimate
grievances. Most worrying were demands of
‘freedom’, not just internal freedom, but freedom
from the Soviet Union. This, no Soviet leaders atthe time would tolerate and the Poles knew thatif Russia’s position were seriously threatened
Poland would be forcibly brought back into line.
Nevertheless the Polish reformists gained the
upper hand. ‘Workers’ councils’ were established
to bring a ‘democratic’ element into manage-
ment. A reform programme was adopted andGomulka emerged as its leading exponent on 
the Central Committee. In the struggle with the
Stalinists he soon enjoyed extensive popular sup-
port in Warsaw and other cities. The crisis pointwas reached in mid-October 1956. The Sovietleadership became so alarmed that Khrushchev
and a high-powered Soviet delegation arrived
uninvited in Warsaw to halt the slide, which
might end in a repudiation of Soviet control and
of socialism. Soviet troop movements were set inmotion. Poland was on the brink of bloody con-ﬂict. It is interesting to compare the situations in
Poland and Hungary at this time and to ask why
an armed conﬂict developed in Hungary but was
averted in Poland.It is clear that Khrushchev wanted to avoid amilitary showdown, whether in Poland or in
Hungary, because he realised the immense setback
it would mean for his reformist policies and for his478THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
own position in Moscow. From a Soviet point ofview the danger Gomulka presented lay in hisPolish nationalism – another Tito could not be
tolerated. Then there was the even greater danger
that a national popular uprising would occur and
that the Polish leaders would lose control.Gomulka convinced Khrushchev that only he andthe reformers could retain control, that while he
wished to correct the Stalinist errors of the past he
was a convinced communist, and that while Polish
nationalism required that Poland assert the right
to be treated as a sovereign nation Poland wouldremain loyal to the Soviet alliance. What wasequally clear to Khrushchev was not only that
Gomulka enjoyed immense popular support for
his stand, but that the Polish army would be likely
to side with the Polish leadership, however hope-less the struggle. Khrushchev had enough troubleon his hands without inviting more, but he
returned home with misgivings. Before the end of
the year the Stalinists were purged from the Polish
party and the Russians agreed to abandon directinterference in Polish affairs. The way was open for‘national communism’. Gomulka also delivered
his side of the bargain. Poland remained a com-
munist state; it did not repudiate its membership
of the Warsaw Pact and did not intervene on
Hungary’s side. The Polish leaders recognised thelimits of Soviet tolerance. The Hungarians did notand paradoxically it was Hungarian support for
Poland that radicalised the Hungarian unrest into
a full-scale rebellion against Soviet domination.Hungary had suffered particularly under the ironhand of the Stalinist ﬁrst secretary Mátyás Rákosi,
having since the summer of 1949 been turned
into a communist state on the Soviet model.
Rákosi eliminated his communist rivals, even
hanging Laszlo Rajk, a former minister of theinterior. The peasantry was forced into collectivi-sation and industry was placed under central state
control. The prisons ﬁlled and a vast and much
hated secret police enormously extended its 
activities. To Khrushchev and the majority of theKremlin leadership an unreformed Rákosi was adistinct liability. Rákosi in turn anxiously watched
the de-stalinisation developments in Poland and
was shaken by the apparent Yugoslav–Soviet rec-onciliation. His response to demands for eco-
nomic reforms and for more freedoms within acommunist system, which were being advocated
by intellectuals and the more progressive com-
munists around Imre Nagy, was to clamp down
even more severely in the summer of 1956. InJuly, however, the Kremlin forced him to resign.There was no strong and popular communistlike Gomulka to replace him. The post of ﬁrst sec-
retary was given to another, hardly less hated
Stalinist, Ernö Gerö. At least János Kádár, a cau-
tious reformer, who later was to play a critical rolein the revolution and the post-revolutionary his-tory of Hungary, joined the Hungarian Politburo.After July, the divided Hungarian leadershipand the still overwhelmingly Stalinist party
machine failed to provide any ﬁrm national com-
munist direction to those such as the students,intellectuals and many urban Hungarians who
were looking for change. Imre Nagy was poten-

tially the only popular communist around whom
the nation might have rallied, but like a good com-
munist he refused to organise an opposition.Concessions by the Politburo were interpreted as
signs of weakness. Opposition grew and took more
and more challenging forms under the inﬂuence of

the Polish October. On 23 October 1956 students
spearheaded a mass demonstration of support forPoland in the Hungarian capital. A ban on thedemonstration, which looked as if it would have
been in vain, was lifted. At ﬁrst everything pro-

ceeded peaceably. But during the evening the
hated Hungarian security police, the AVO, startedﬁring on demonstrators. The demonstrators werejoined by huge crowds calling for Imre Nagy. Gerö
then agreed to the intervention of Soviet troops to
restore order. At this stage they behaved with
restraint. On the following day, 24 October, the
Hungarian Politburo, in the hope of containingthe revolutionary situation, appointed Nagy pre-
mier but Gerö remained ﬁrst secretary.
The party had lost the support of the peopleand, although the greater part of the Hungarian
army did not join the rising, the Politburo felt toouncertain of the soldiers’ loyalty to use themagainst their fellow countrymen. The rising was
spreading through Hungary and was taking the
form of a national rebellion. That same evening1EASTERN EUROPE AND THE SOVIET UNION479
of 24 October two important emissaries arrivedfrom Moscow, Mikhail Suslov, the party ideolo-gist, and Anastas Mikoyan, the oldest member of
the Politburo to have survived Stalin’s purges, a
man of negotiating skill and adaptability. They
agreed with Nagy that Soviet intervention hadbeen a mistake and consented to the dismissal ofGerö and his replacement by Kádár. The Kremlin
saw a ‘Polish solution’ as the lesser evil, despite
the danger of allowing the uprising to spread 
disaffection to Czechoslovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria. That did not happen. Nor was there aPolish solution in Hungary.Nagy was being swept along by the rising andthe committees and organisations springing up 
all over Hungary. His success in securing the 
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Budapest onlycreated the illusion that the mass protest ofHungarians against communist autocracy and for-
eign occupation had succeeded. A heady Hungar-
ian nationalism asserted itself. Nagy tried to ride
the revolutionary wave in order to direct it intoless dangerous paths. On 29 October Suslov andMikoyan were back in Budapest. The following
day Nagy announced that Hungary would return
to a multi-party system, making a decisive breach
with communist (though not necessarily socialist)
rule. But when he gave way to the demand thatHungary should withdraw from the Warsaw Pact,the writing was on the wall. The Kremlin could
not afford to lose total control or to take the risk
of being replaced in Hungary by the West. Anglo-
French preoccupation with Suez made the Russiandecision to intervene easier; it was equally clearthat the US would restrict itself to diplomatic
protests. What the Soviet leaders had to weigh 
was the effect of their decision whether or not to
intervene on Eastern and central Europe. The
Warsaw Pact and Russia’s whole position was in jeopardy. The Chinese, Bulgarian, Romanianand Czechoslovak leaders were urging interven-
tion; Poland was busy with its own affairs and
Yugoslavia could not oppose the Soviet Union in
Hungary. So the Kremlin decided on the repres-sion of the Hungarian rising.The pretext for intervention was provided byKádár. The first secretary had left Budapest and had broken with Nagy, whose supporters 
he condemned as counter-revolutionaries. On 3
November 1956 Soviet tank divisions returned in
force. The Hungarians, who had hastily armedthemselves, were joined by only a few detach-ments from the Hungarian army. Civilians were
resisting trained troops and the Russian suppres-
sion of Hungarians ﬁghting for independence and
democracy could be seen on Western television
screens. The ﬁght lasted long enough to inﬂuenceWestern opinion against the Russians. In the Westit also opened the eyes of many communists and
fellow travellers, who now left the party. Nagy and
the Hungarian military commander Pal Maleter
were arrested while negotiating (they were latertried and executed). Soviet tanks showed norestraint this time but pulverised any building
from which riﬂe ﬁre was heard. Thousands of
Hungarian refugees ﬂed to the West, and armed
resistance in Hungary was soon crushed.Kádár, carried to power on the back of Soviettanks, now worked to restore some semblance of
credible Hungarian independence. He accepted
that the Kremlin would not permit any demo-
cratic multi-party government or Hungarian neu-
trality. Provided, however, that the Kremlin couldbe reassured on these two crucial points, then, asin Poland, the Kremlin would allow Hungary
some degree of autonomy and freedom to choose
its own path. That was Khrushchev’s policy and,
to the surprise of the West, Kádár at ﬁrst very cau-tiously and then much more boldly charted thecourse of Hungarian autonomy within the Soviet
alliance. In economic policies, Kádár followed a
new course, less repressive, less rigidly centralised,
allowing some scope for private enterprise and so
eventually turned Hungary into the most liberaland, for a time, most prosperous communiststate. Kádár’s realistic nationalism and his
country’s growing prosperity in the end more rec-
onciled the Hungarians to his regime, which had
saved them from the threat of another Sovietintervention.480THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
The Polish and Hungarian crises, following onKhrushchev’s violent denunciation of Stalin and
advocacy of reform, undermined the Soviet
leader’s position within the Kremlin. He hadnever been strong enough to oust the Stalinists inthe Praesidium (Politburo), among them Molotov
and Malenkov, who now attacked him on the eas-
iest of targets – the economy, which under cen-
tralist control never lived up to expectations. The
struggle took the form of disputing which werethe right reforms to follow: reforms which soughtto make the government ministries more efﬁcient,
a policy backed by Malenkov and Molotov, or
reforms based on reconstituted party control over
the economy regionally organised, as advocatedby Khrushchev. The conﬂict came to a head inJune 1957 when the Praesidium, by a majority of
seven to four, voted against Khrushchev. That
should have been the end. But Khrushchev turned
the tables by appealing to the larger party body,
the Central Committee, which he claimed alonecould deprive him of the post of ﬁrst secretary.With Marshal Zhukov’s help, military aircraft ﬂew
the party representatives to Moscow from the out-
lying provinces. Khrushchev won the support he
needed and dubbed his opponents on thePraesidium the ‘anti-party’ group. All these oppo-nents now lost real power for good, but there was
to be no return to Stalinist vengeance. They were
sent far away; it was with a touch of humour that
Khrushchev decided to send the dour Molotov asambassador to Mongolia and Malenkov to man-age a power station in Kazakhstan; only Bulganinwas allowed to remain at the centre, acting as tit-
ular premier until 1958.From 1957 until his sudden deposition by thePraesidium in 1964, Khrushchev dominated the Soviet Union in its domestic and foreign rela-
tions, though not as Stalin had done. Opponents
no longer had to fear death, but a displeased
Khrushchev could end their careers and demote
them or banish them. His enduring contribu-tion was to dismantle the Stalinist terror regimeand to discredit it. Indeed, discrediting it became
a potent weapon with which to defeat his ri-
vals, who had played subordinate roles in it.
Khrushchev restored the party, with its hierarchyappointed by him, to primacy in the economic andpolitical administration of the country. This meant
that no far-reaching economic reforms would be
possible: the Soviet Union remained a command
economy. But it had become a more tolerant
country; its leader was the son of a miner, robustlyhuman, resilient, tough, with a sense of humour,unpolished in speech and manner, but someone
with whom it was thought in the West it was pos-

sible to do business. Khrushchev announced that
he believed in peaceful competition and that theSoviet Union would win; boastfully he added, ‘Wewill bury you’, a remark which was taken too liter-
ally in the West. Khrushchev genuinely wanted to
better the lot of the ordinary people in his own
day, not to sacriﬁce them to some future goal. Hecomes across as a man who wanted to be liked, but1Chapter 44THE FALL OF KHRUSHCHEV
THE SOVIET UNION AND THE WIDER WORLDalso as one who wished to be acknowledged asleader without the danger of Stalin’s cult of thepersonality re-emerging.Despite Khrushchev’s goals, which seemed tobe not unlike those of the West, the apparent 
convergence of West and East was an illusion.Khrushchev had lived all his life within a state sys-
tem that was ruled from above. He wished to cor-

rect its most gross errors, but believed that
centralised planning was essential to communism.
The Soviet Union would continue to be ruled
from above; reforms would be introduced only asthe necessity for them was perceived in theKremlin. At the same time the people would be
brought into more active participation. Khrush-

chev tried to reduce the dead weight of bureau-

cracy but was caught in the paradox that this couldnot be done unless decision-making was decen-
tralised. The most maddening aspect of Khrush-

chev’s period of power was its unpredictability, a
reﬂection of Khrushchev’s mercurial temperament;
he delighted in springing surprises.Typically, writers and intellectuals could neverbe sure where they were. Thus, in 1958 Boris
Pasternak was persecuted and forbidden to collect
the Nobel Prize, but Solzhenitsyn’s novel about a
day in Stalin’s labour camp was allowed to be pub-
lished because it was in line with Khrushchev’sown denunciation. Censorship remained erratic,though more freedom was allowed to writers. But
Khrushchev was far less tolerant of organised reli-
gion, and many churches and synagogues were
closed.Unrestrained by powerful rivals, Khrushchev’spolicies were frequently changed, which con-
tributed to their lack of success. His various reor-
ganisations of industrial and agricultural controls
created confusion and waste. In the area most
vital to Soviet living standards, agriculture, theimprovements of the early years were not sus-tained after 1958. Bad weather and unsoundfarming methods reduced the contribution from
the virgin lands. In industry, Khrushchev’s decen-
tralising reforms, removing one level of planning
to the regions, also caused severe disruption. Thegrowth rate of Soviet industry slowed down andfailed to fulﬁl his unrealistic plans.Khrushchev understood the enormous changesthe Soviet Union was undergoing as it developed
from a mainly rural to an urbanised country with a
population that was better educated and a largesection of professional people demanding higherstandards of living: more consumer goods, better
housing, better health provision, more varied and
more plentiful food and more opportunities for
higher education. He launched special campaignsconcentrating on one or other sector of supply,organised and reorganised the running of the
economy and made promises and set ambitious
targets that could not be fulﬁlled. In the decade

from 1955 to 1965 growth was impressive butcould not match expanding expectations. The fail-
ure of agriculture to make anything like the
progress planned is illustrated by the ﬁgures in the

table below.Khrushchev was not only ambitiously attempt-ing to raise production, and nuclear-missile capac-ity, but simultaneously working to rejuvenate andmake the party more effective. Neither he nor his
successors could solve the basic problem of how482THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64

to organise an increasingly sophisticated economywithout relegating the party to a subordinate rolein the state, a subordination which they feared
would undermine the leadership and government
of the USSR. Yet a centralised authoritarian party
structure seeking to take the major decisionswithout reference to self-regulatory market forcesis simply not equipped to manage the vast and
complex industry of a modern state. In agricul-
ture various communist efforts to stimulate pro-
duction also proved wasteful of resources.Khrushchev’s erratic course was especially evi-dent in his handling of the Soviet Union’s exter-nal relations. He correctly foresaw the importance
of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as the
vital deterrent and measure of military power.
‘Going nuclear’, moreover, allowed a reduction inthe size of the Red Army at a time of labour short-age due to the smaller wartime birth rate. The
launching into space of Sputnik in October 1957
was a rare propaganda triumph – the Soviet Union
appeared brieﬂy to be technologically ahead of theUS. The reverse was true, and the Soviet Unionpaid dearly for this propaganda ﬁrst. It helped to
discredit Eisenhower’s more restrained armaments
policies and prompted John F. Kennedy to close
the ‘missile gap’ that never was. The nuclear-arms
race was signiﬁcantly accelerated just as the SovietUnion was closing the real missile gap with the USin the 1960s.In the Middle East, Khrushchev took advantageof Western hostility to Egypt to establish bases in
Egypt and in Syria and to assist in building theAswan High Dam. But the beneﬁts Russia gained
were limited and its Arab allies proved uncertain
friends more concerned to take advantage of Soviet
aid than to offer much in return. But Soviet com-

mitments, though costly, were likewise limited.
Khrushchev threatened Britain and France duringthe Suez War in November 1956, but they wereidle threats. The US did not withdraw its funda-

mental support of Israel, and the Soviet Union
would not risk a direct military confrontation with
the Americans by involving Russian ‘volunteers’and pilots in actual ﬁghting in the Middle East.
The Arab states did not want to introduce Soviet-
style communism, or to be dominated by the
Soviet Union as its East European allies were.Indeed, the identity of interests was a tenuousone. The shift from Stalin’s European-centredpolicy to the post-Stalin global policies cost the
USSR a great deal and yielded few dividends. 
The Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, Egypt, Cuba,
Ghana, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Angola andIndia all received Soviet aid at various times andwere courted by the Soviet Union. But the
Russians suffered setbacks in all these relation-
ships, most spectacularly in China.China had expected to be treated as an equalafter Stalin’s death, but although it had developedan independent world policy it still relied onSoviet aid. Divergences between the Chinese and
Soviet viewpoints increased as the 1950s drew to
a close. According to Mao, Khrushchev’s empha-
sis on Soviet material advances sapped the truerevolutionary spirit that should be impelling thecommunist camp forward in the world. The
Russian leader’s pursuit of detente with the US
after 1958 led the Chinese to conclude that the
world was once again endangered by the nationalchauvinism of the two superpowers. This becameeven more evident to the Chinese when the
Russians refused to help them to become a
nuclear power. During Khrushchev’s last two
years of leadership the Sino-Soviet break became
unbridgeable.Ironically, the Soviet–US detente did not lastlong, given the way Khrushchev handled it. The
Paris summit in May 1960, intended to seek solu-
tions to Berlin and the German question, was
called off before it began, Khrushchev decidingagainst negotiating with Eisenhower in the terminal period of his presidency, and the U-2
incident provided the means to humiliate the
American president. A meeting with President
Kennedy in Vienna in June 1961 brought the
Russians no nearer to their desired solution of theGerman problem. Meanwhile, Berlin remainedthe open door through which the citizens of East
Germany poured to express their preference for
the West. The construction of the Berlin Wall in
August 1961 to block that exit became an openadmission of the bankruptcy of Soviet policies andthose of the East German regime. Neither con-
ciliatory statements nor threats, which succeeded
on each other, had much effect on the West1THE FALL OF KHRUSHCHEV483
except to accelerate the arms race. Khrushchev’smost daring attempt to redress America’s geo-
graphical advantage in its confrontation with theSoviet Union came to grief in the seas surround-ing the island of Cuba. America’s allies on the
borders of the Soviet eastern empire provided
bases from which missiles could hit Soviet cities;
the Soviet Union at this time could threaten onlyAmerica’s European allies and had no reliablemissiles with which to attack the US.Rebuffed by the US in 1960, Castro hadturned to Russia for aid, and agreements to pro-
vide credit to Cuba and to purchase its sugar crop
were concluded in 1960. The failure of the CIA’sBay of Pigs landing of Cuban exiles to overthrowCastro in April 1961 convinced the Cuban leader
that the US was determined to subjugate his
country and drove him deeper into Russia’s arms.
Khrushchev promised to defend the island andaccused the US of banditry. In the following year,1962, Khrushchev decided to install nuclear mis-siles in Cuba and to build a Soviet base there. This
daring Soviet move, which would bring the USwithin range of many more Soviet missiles, wascarried out secretly. The Cuban missile crisis 
that followed appeared to bring the Soviet Union
and the US to the brink of nuclear war. But
Khrushchev was obliged to withdraw. For theSoviet Union this perceived failure marked a greatsetback, less in its relations with the West, which
soon improved again, than with its standing in the
socialist camp. The Chinese took due note: the
Soviet Union too had proved a paper tiger.
Finally, any hope the Kremlin might have had ofoverawing the West in future negotiations overBerlin or Germany lay in ruins. But the world
beyond the two superpowers could breathe again,
relieved that sanity had prevailed and that ideo-
logical fanaticism had not this time as in 1939plunged the world into unimaginable devastation.484THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64

ing on the Black Sea, his removal from the lead-
ership was announced in Moscow. He wasallowed to retire quietly and died in obscurity in1971 – at least that had been the intention of the
new Soviet leaders. They underlined their con-
tempt by not honouring his remains with a state
funeral or a burial place close to Lenin. ButKhrushchev refused to become a nonentity andhad one more surprise in store before his uncer-
emonious end. He had recorded his memoirs on
tape and shortly before his death saw their ﬁrst
publication in the West. Like his other breacheswith the past, this was a ﬁrst in Soviet history. Inthe decades between Stalin and Gorbachev,Khrushchev did more to change the Soviet Union
than any other leader, albeit without finding
remedies for the shortcomings of communist rule
of the economy. Nor could communism be rec-onciled with basic freedoms. History will never-theless accord him a more important place than
the Soviet leadership was willing to acknowledge.From a later vantage point, Khrushchev’s yearsof power are viewed in a different light inside and
outside the Soviet Union. The Russian peoplecould look back on Khrushchev with gratitude forintroducing the ﬁrst breath of fresh air and free-
dom, although it was stiﬂed again during the long
interlude of the Brezhnev decades. Banished from
Red Square, Khrushchev lies buried in theNovodevichy Convent grounds with other famousRussians, Chekhov, Scriabin and Gogol. The
grave is not neglected, but is covered with ﬂowers
in memory of the man who ﬁrst opened the gates
of the vast prison complex of Stalin’s Gulag.1THE FALL OF KHRUSHCHEV485
Dwight D. Eisenhower was a military hero beforehe became president. Immensely popular, with an
infectious boyish grin, he represented, like
Abraham Lincoln, an important aspect of theAmerican tradition. His parents were neitherinﬂuential nor wealthy. He grew up in Abilene,
Kansas, a small farming community where his
father managed a creamery. Through sheer force
of intelligence and character, Ike (his nickname
from boyhood) succeeded in passing the highlycompetitive entry tests to West Point militaryacademy. Practically his whole adult life was spent
in the army, his career reaching its peak when he
was appointed allied supreme commander of the
D-Day invasion forces in 1944. He stayed inGermany for only a few weeks after accepting thesurrender of the Nazi armed forces in May 1945
as American military governor. His European
command was far more than a military one. He
had to handle temperamental Allied generals as
well as American, not to mention statesmen asvaried as Churchill and General de Gaulle. Hesucceeded brilliantly, playing a decisive diplomatic
and military role. After three years (1945–8) as
US army chief of staff, and an uncomfortable 
spell as president of Columbia University, he wasappointed by Truman in 1951 to the overallcommand of the allied forces being organised in
Europe under NATO.His transition to the political arena, leading tohis nomination as Republican presidential candi-
date in July 1952 at the Chicago Convention, wasswift, having been organised behind the scenes byinfluential Republicans such as Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge, Governor Dewey and the ﬁnancier

Paul Hoffman. Eisenhower allowed himself to beprevailed upon, despite his misgivings about theparticipation of the military in politics: American
history provided the unhappy example of a military
hero turned president – Ulysses S. Grant, whose
administration was wracked by scandal. But there
was another precedent – George Washington, thewise Founding Father. Eisenhower was persuadedto follow his crusade in Europe with another cru-

sade, to preserve the two-party system and democ-

racy in the US, to free Americans from excessive
government and, above all, to ensure that the USwould lead the free world against the perils of athe-
istic communism. The Republican Party machine
was dominated by the conservative wing led by
Senator Robert Taft, who not only reﬂected a

widely held belief that the Truman administration
was soft on communism, but also rather perverselyrepresented the revived isolationist ‘America ﬁrst’
patriotism. Eisenhower viewed a return to isola-

tionism and to the ‘fortress America’ mentality as a
disastrous error. He saw it as his duty to meet this
challenge, if his own popularity was all that couldprevail over the Taft forces within the RepublicanParty and over the Democratic candidate Adlai
Stevenson in the US at large. In a campaign
marred by personal attacks by the foul-mouthed
Wisconsin Senator McCarthy and by Republicancharges against the failure of the Truman adminis-
Chapter 45THE EISENHOWER YEARSCAUTION AT HOME AND CONTAINMENT
ABROADtration to defend the US within and without fromthe communist enemy, Eisenhower appeared outof touch, unable to check the excesses of those
Republicans he despised. He relied on his personal
popularity, on the trust he inspired as a plain-
speaking, honest man above partisan politics andon his ﬁnal vote-winning promise that he would goto Korea to make peace. Eisenhower’s running-
mate in the 1952 election was the youthful Senator
Richard M. Nixon, who during the campaign sur-

vived the accusation that he had accepted a slush
fund for his political campaign. The growingimportance of television in politics was demon-
strated by the success of his emotional appeal for
support ﬂanked by his family and his pet dog.Governor Adlai Stevenson, the Democraticcandidate, possessed none of Eisenhower’scharisma, which could be exploited on televisionin the nation’s homes. He did not present himself
as an ‘image president’ who, like Eisenhower,
blurred issues and relied on projecting himself as a
trustworthy father ﬁgure. Instead he campaignedon real issues: civil rights, foreign policy and thedomestic problems confronting Americans –
‘Let’s talk sense to the American people.’ His
speeches analysed problems with intellectual
sharpness and wit. His opponents derided him as
an ‘egghead’ and distributed buttons bearing thesimple slogan ‘I like Ike’. Stevenson lost, but notbadly, with 27.3 million voting for him as against
33.8 million for Eisenhower. The Republicans
also gained small majorities in the Senate and the
House. In 1956 Eisenhower stood for a secondterm, once more against Stevenson, and won –increasing his own share of the vote but this 
time losing both Houses of Congress. When it
came to domestic issues, the American people
trusted Eisenhower more than they trusted the
Republican Party.When Eisenhower entered the White House inJanuary 1953, he brought with him a ﬁrm set of
values without having formulated much in the way
of speciﬁc policies. American prosperity was based
on rugged individualism and self-reliance, on busi-ness enterprise and on minimising the weight ofgovernment on both citizen and industry. The 
US was, in the view of Eisenhower and many
other Republicans, suffering from creeping social-ism and from government waste, which drainedresources from the nation’s wealth-producingactivities. Increased government spending, more-
over, and budget deﬁcits had led to inﬂation.
Eisenhower’s inner Cabinet was composed of 
successful and practical men, such as the secretaryof the treasury, George Humphrey, who wereintended to bring to government the effective
management skills with which they had run their
businesses and banks. Even his international
expert, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, a
lawyer by training but with considerable experi-ence of foreign affairs, had been closely connectedwith the corporate world. The spirit of the
Eisenhower administration was perhaps encapsu-
lated in the words of the secretary of defense,
Charles E. Wilson, formerly president of GeneralMotors: ‘What was good for our country wasgood for General Motors, and vice versa.’In domestic affairs Eisenhower conveyed animpression of weakness and indecision, of a simpleman more at home on the golf course than deal-ing with political inﬁghting on Capitol Hill. He
certainly wished to avoid confrontations, espe-

cially with the ‘old guard’ of the Republican Party;
entrenched in Congress, these conservatives were
led ﬁrst by Senator Taft, and after his death bySenator William Knowland. Eisenhower believedin moderation and compromise. Despite the
rhetoric uttered during the Republican campaign,
he made no efforts to undo the welfare provisions
for the poor – indeed he extended social-securitypayments to another 10.5 million people andraised benefits when unemployment increased
under the impact of the recession in 1953 and
1954 that followed the end of the Korean War.
He described himself as ‘liberal on human issues,
conservative on economic ones’. It is true that hewas liberal on some issues, such as social welfare or immigration, but in general he cannot be
described as progressive. In ﬁscal policy, although
unable to cut the federal expenditure of the last
two years of the Truman administration as muchas he had hoped, Eisenhower and GeorgeHumphrey refused to consider the Keynesian
solution of deﬁcit-ﬁnanced government spending
to stimulate the economy.1THE EISENHOWER YEARS487
Eisenhower’s failure to combat SenatorMcCarthy until much damage had been done athome and to America’s reputation abroad exposed
a deﬁciency in the president’s political skills. As the
senator’s accusations grew wilder and bred a
destructive atmosphere of suspicion and denuncia-
tion among tens of thousands of loyal Americancitizens, many appeals reached the White House
demanding that the president speak out against
McCarthy. Eisenhower’s response was that it was
the task of McCarthy’s fellow senators to discipline
one of their own; the presidency, he claimed,should not interfere in Congress. He loathedMcCarthy’s smear tactics and hated the man, but
he to some extent also shared the belief that com-

munist subversion of America’s free society needed
to be checked by loyalty oaths, by investigationsand, where necessary, by other stern measures. Hismain reason for non-intervention was undoubtedly
political: he wished to curry favour with the
Republican conservatives even when he privately
disagreed with them. He rationalised his lack ofpolitical courage in various ways. He would claimthat even to mention McCarthy’s name would
increase the senator’s importance. A leader’s job
was to win goodwill; it followed, so Eisenhower
explained, that the leader should reserve all criti-

cism to private discussion and in public shouldutter only favourable sentiments. But in the endMcCarthy’s continued attacks forced Eisenhower
to defend some of the senator’s targets. Even so,
McCarthy went on unchecked until the Senate in
December 1954 at last censured him after he hadoverreached himself in levelling indiscriminatecharges against the army and the administration.
By then, McCarthyism had lost credibility and
public support, and the senator himself had
become a political liability, his methods and behav-

iour condemned by a majority of senators, many ofwhom nevertheless still shared the exaggerated fearof the ‘communist traitors’ within. Although 
the senator tried to continue his crusade, after
December 1954 the media gave him less and less
attention. By the time of his death only three yearslater in 1957, this once feared and powerful manhad lost all his inﬂuence.
McCarthyism unjustly ruined many lives andmany brilliant careers. The smear of ‘guilt by asso-ciation’ cast the net so widely that thousands ofinnocents suffered. Against these thousands ofloyal citizens, how many real traitors who meant
harm to their country were really uncovered? It is
right that a free society should defend itself. That
national security has to be protected is equallyincontestable, and it was perfectly reasonable toconclude that the Soviet Union posed a danger
to the West that had to be guarded against. But
in defending itself against dangers, a society
should not destroy the very values it seeks to
uphold. What was ‘unAmerican’ and counter tothe ideals of American values was McCarthyismitself. McCarthyism also proved a temptation: it
pandered to the resentment of the less well-off
against the privileged, the so-called eastern estab-
lishment. McCarthy declared that the traitorswere to be found not among the poor or theminority groups but among ‘those who have had
all the beneﬁts’. Those who identiﬁed themselves
with McCarthyism thereby automatically pro-

claimed their ‘patriotism’. The pre-eminentsigniﬁcance of the McCarthy years, however, isthat the senator and his works were in the end
rejected, that American institutions proved sufﬁ-
ciently strong to cleanse themselves after a period
of weakness.But there was another issue, of much longerstanding, going back to America’s colonial past,which starkly revealed the contrast between the
constitutionally endorsed aspirations of a free and
democratic people and the reality.The issue of civil rights and equality came todominate American political life in the 1950s and
1960s. About one in nine Americans was classi-
ﬁed by the census as non-white, the great major-
ity of these being black: in 1950 some 15 million,
in 1960 18.9 million and in 1970 (out of a totalUS population of 203.2 million) 22.7 million.African Americans were denied civil rights not
only in the South but also in the North, where
they were increasingly crowded into city ghettos.
They suffered more than their share of poverty;social deprivation as well as segregation and theprejudice of the majority whites meant that from
one generation to the next opportunities for
advancement were limited.488THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
The shared experience of the Second WorldWar began to shift attitudes. Black and white sol-diers had died for the same cause. In particular
they had fought against the ‘master race’ and all its
crimes against those it held to be ‘inferior races’.
But black GIs stationed in the Nazi citadel ofNürnberg at the end of the war could not sharetheir quarters with white GIs; and most of their
ofﬁcers were white. This of course reﬂected the
superior and inferior racial attitudes that still 
prevailed in the US. Not until the Vietnam War
were black servicemen truly integrated in thearmed services, yet at home black and whiteAmericans did not mix socially and were segre-
gated in schools, for housing, on transport and,
generally, in worship. In a thousand and one ways
a black American was made to feel separate andinferior. In the nation’s capital a black personcould not enter a good restaurant and expect to be
served. This became particularly embarrassing
when black diplomats from the newly independ-
ent African nations were being sent to Washing-ton. Segregation, moreover, was a gift the SovietUnion did not fail to exploit, for example by 
honouring the great black American singer Paul
Robeson, who spoke up for black equality and
expressed his admiration for the USSR.During the 1950s and 1960s agitation in theSouth by African Americans and by whites, manyof the latter college students from the east, made
headlines. Police truncheoning defenceless civil-
ians, bombings and riots presented the dark side
of American civilisation. But more and morewhites supported black protests against injustice,and those with faith in the American people and
institutions believed they would overcome the
entrenched prejudice. The success of the civil
rights movement in changing laws and proce-

dures – making itself felt slowly, despite many set-backs, in the 1950s before gathering force in the1960s – provided striking evidence that tradi-

tional discrimination had to yield to reform. The
bastions of ‘Jim Crow’, discriminatory anti-black
practices in the South, began falling one by one.The US shares with many other countries theproblems caused by racial or religious intolerance.
But few could have foretold the changes in atti-
tudes that have taken place in the US within justone generation. Black Americans now wieldsigniﬁcant political power. Even so, practical asopposed to legal discrimination in education, job
opportunities and housing remain to be over-

come. In conditions of unemployment and reces-
sion African Americans continue to suffer farmore severely than their fellow citizens.The landmarks of black protest in the 1950sand 1960s are clearly delineated. Lawyers of the
National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People won a Supreme Court ruling in
1954 that swept away the segregationist sub-
terfuge of ‘separate but equal’ in public school-ing. There would no longer be any justiﬁcation
for separating children solely on account of their
race, a principle already applicable to higher edu-
cation. But a ruling, no matter how valuable, isone thing, its enforcement – in a country wherestate rights and community control over local ser-
vices is strong – quite another. Integration was
ﬁercely resisted everywhere; racial prejudice, of
course, played a large part, but resistance was alsosparked by social and educational tensions asbetter-off families found themselves being forced
to share their facilities with the deprived. The
bussing of children between the more afﬂuent
parts of a city and the worse off aroused ﬁerce
resentment, for example, when it proved moredifﬁcult to maintain the educational standards ofmixed social groups. The real test came in the
South on the issue of whether local communities
could defy Supreme Court rulings when African
Americans were courageous enough to insist onthe rights accorded by them. The struggle couldnot just be left to lawyers. In 1956 a black girl
was prevented by force and intimidation from
entering the University of Alabama. In the fol-
lowing year there was a dramatic confrontation
between federal authorities and the State ofArkansas when school officials at Little Rockdemanded that nine black girls be prevented from
entering the Central High School. Governor
Orval Faubus backed the school ofﬁcials, and only
when Eisenhower reluctantly met the challengeby ordering federal troops to ensure the blackchildren’s safety in entering the school did the
state authorities back off. The crisis as far as the
children were concerned festered on for many1THE EISENHOWER YEARS489
months, as the troops remained to protect theirrights: sensational conﬂicts reached the newspa-pers and other media, but thousands of less news-
worthy incidents across the US did their damage
in obscurity.The change in attitudes was brought about byblack leadership, championed by ardent groups ofwhite Americans and backed by mass black
support. Federal authorities, the presidency and
Congress were slow to act. Eisenhower, more
cautious on the issue than Truman had been,
claimed that it was a question of changing heartsand minds, which could not be accomplished bylaw or by force. So, before they could receive
justice, the African Americans would have to wait
for the gradual reformation of their fellow
citizens. Eisenhower had his eyes ﬁxed on thepolitical repercussions in the South of forcing theissue and so provided little leadership, except
where federal authority was directly challenged, as
it had been at Little Rock. In the 1960s the
Kennedy brothers and President Johnson were to take a much more positive attitude to thedemands of the emerging black leaders.The Reverend Martin Luther King, a Baptistminister, rose to prominence in organising a black
boycott of buses in Montgomery, Alabama, in
1955, after Rosa Parks, a courageous black seam-stress, had refused to give up her seat to a whiteman and move to the back of the bus. The black
boycott hit the pockets of the bus company, until
a year later the Supreme Court ruled that segre-
gation of transport, state as well as interstate, wasunconstitutional. Blacks were ﬂexing their eco-nomic muscles and soon other businesses were
similarly placed under pressure. All aspects of seg-
regation, in schools, restaurants, housing and
political rights, became the targets of the organ-
ised protest movement in the decade that fol-lowed.The 1950s was the decade of the Cold War, whenfor the first time the world lived under the
shadow of two countries, now called ‘superpow-ers’, both possessing nuclear weapons. In August1949 the Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb
and by the mid-1950s had perfected the hydro-
gen bomb. The testing of these weapons by thenuclear countries was poisoning the environment,though at the time few were aware of the addi-tional cancers that were being caused. Research
and testing of the necessary intercontinental mis-
siles to deliver destruction progressed equally fast.
The Soviet Union was catching up with the US,though not as rapidly in missiles as the Americanssupposed.The year 1950 was crucial in the history of theCold War. The US administration reached the
conclusion that economic and military aid alone
were no longer enough to defend the West.American strategy made its priority the contain-
ment of communism within the Asian mainland.
Troops were sent to Korea, the only territory on
the mainland defended by US troops, in order 
to prove that communist aggression did not pay.In September 1950 the decision was taken inWashington to send US combat troops to Europe
as well, to form part of the military defence of
NATO; three months later Dwight D. Eisenhower
was appointed the alliance’s supreme commander.This marked a radical new commitment. So, by thetime Eisenhower was inaugurated as president on
20 January 1953, the Cold War in Europe and the
hot war in Korea faced the US with global chal-

lenges and the prospect of huge military expendi-

tures. Now that the US had a president who was ageneral of great experience, perhaps the Cold Warwould be waged not emotionally but with careful
military planning. Eisenhower was a cautious man,
fully aware of the immense dangers of war, but also
conscious of the dangers inherent in constantlypreparing for a war.The ending of the Korean War, wasteful ofboth lives and resources, became an obvious pri-
ority. Eisenhower had become convinced that it
was military folly to allow the American forces to
remain bogged down in the face of the Chineseand North Koreans. Armistice negotiations haddragged on at Kaesong and Panmunjon since the
summer of 1951. The issue of 22,000 North
Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in UN
camps who did not wish to return home dead-locked all negotiations, which India, as honestbroker, attempted to facilitate. Eventually on 27
July 1953, following more than three years of
war, after bitter wrangling and despite the resis-490THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
tance of Syngman Rhee, who did not want to endthe war short of uniﬁcation on South Korea’sterms, a truce was concluded. The fighting
stopped and Korea was effectively partitioned.The Eisenhower administration on 10 Octobersigned another security treaty, with the Republicof Korea (South Korea), to provide a guaranteeof joint defence if an attack was renewed from the
north. The US also promised economic aid to
restore the south. But the truce did not prove a
preliminary step towards unification, despite
endless negotiations. South Korean ‘democracy’,moreover, was a mockery during Syngman Rhee’seight years of rule and even after he was driven
from power in 1960. The link with the West and
the US in particular, however, provided the basis
for South Korea’s economic miracle of the suc-ceeding three decades.Until his death in May 1959, Secretary of StateJohn Foster Dulles exerted a commanding inﬂu-
ence over US foreign policy during the two
Eisenhower administrations, especially over itsstyle and tone. A Presbyterian layman, a lawyerwith experience of international affairs, he repre-
sented a tradition in US foreign policy of assert-
ing that morality and principle must underlie all
America’s dealings in the world. He criticised
Truman’s policy of containment of communism,insisting that it was no more than a negative reac-tion to an evil. The communists should be made
to give up what they had illegally seized; the
Soviet Union’s sphere of influence should be
rolled back in Eastern and central Europe; therecould be no accommodation with Russia. Nor didDulles shrink from threatening the use of nuclear
weapons in defence of the free world. He con-
demned neutralism in the Third World – as he
saw it, the choice was between two kinds of soci-
eties, the good and the evil. In meeting the com-munist challenge Dulles came to be regarded asa ‘Cold War warrior’, as his rhetoric and deliber-
ate brinkmanship in threatening war proved to be
thoroughly alarming. It was verbal deterrence to
back up nuclear deterrence. Dulles was skilful,tough and predictable. In a world of upheaval anduncertainty the policies he advocated – the cre-
ation of defensive alliances in Asia and Europe –
contributed to the stabilisation of the status quo,except in Indo-China. For all the talk of rollingback communism, caution prevailed when unrestspread through the Soviet satellites of East
Germany, Poland and Hungary; Dulles, though,
must share some blame for encouraging revolt
and then denying all material assistance. Eisen-hower presented the more conciliatory side ofAmerican diplomacy. Their partnership was for-
midable and, on the whole, successful.Reducing American armed forces in Korea ﬁtted
in with Eisenhower’s and Dulles’s perception of
how best to meet the threat of world communism.While they recognised that there were national dif-
ferences within the communist alliance that might
be advantageously exploited, they also subscribed
to the view that communism was a coherent and
dangerous ideology, and that the Kremlin wascoordinating a policy of global thrusts whereverthe West was weak. That coordination might not
be complete, but Eisenhower and Dulles believed
that all the Kremlin’s policies were purposeful and
could be seen at work in what appeared to be unre-
lated events: the Korean invasion, the Huk activi-
ties in the Philippines, the determined effort to
overrun Vietnam, the attempted subversion of
Laos, Cambodia and Burma, the well-nigh success-

ful attempt to take over Iran, the exploitation of
the trouble spot of Trieste, and the penetrationattempted in Guatemala.Dulles concluded that the communist leadersknew that their system could not survive side by
side with the ‘free world’; consequently they had
no alternative but to try to destroy freedom in theworld. The death of Stalin in March 1953, hethought, had only made Soviet policies towards
the rest of the world more subtle, without alter-
ing their essential goal. Dulles urged that a policy
of maximum pressure on Russia’s allies was more
likely to move them away from the Soviet Unionthan a competition for their favour. CommunistChina in particular was recognised as a potentially
unstable Soviet ally.America’s China policy was one of unrelentinghostility. In his ﬁrst State of the Union message to
Congress, Eisenhower declared that the SeventhFleet ‘would no longer be employed to shield
communist China’. This was, however, pure verbal
hostility, since the prospect of the aged Chiang1THE EISENHOWER YEARS491
Kai-shek successfully reconquering the mainlandfrom his Taiwanese base was no longer credible.The following December an American–Nationalist
Chinese defence alliance was concluded, and in
January 1955 Eisenhower even secured the passing
of a joint resolution of Congress declaring thatAmerican forces would be deployed, if necessary,to protect from invasion two small islands, Matsu
and Quemoy, lying just off the Chinese mainland
and garrisoned by Chiang Kai-shek’s troops.
Warfare between the Nationalists and the commu-

nist Chinese was now conﬁned to ineffectual ritual
shelling between the two islands and the mainland.It seems extraordinary now that Eisenhower and
Dulles seriously considered war, even nuclear war,
with China in defence of the two small islands, but
for the Americans they were of enormous signiﬁ-
cance. The containment barrier of Red China mustbe drawn in the Paciﬁc, restraining it from adven-

tures beyond its mainland coastline, otherwise it
could extend its attacks not only to Taiwan but to
Japan and even the Philippines. Communist Chinabecame such a bogey that even Eisenhower’s cau-
tious judgement was affected. Dulles came to
regard the successful defence of Quemoy and
Matsu as his greatest triumph and believed that
brinkmanship had, here, saved the peace.Eisenhower was following a broad spectrum ofpolicies to meet what he saw as the communistglobal threat. As an experienced military com-
mander he was ready to employ all the weapons
and means at his disposal and rejected as naive the
view that spying or covert operations should beavoided by the West on moral grounds, eventhough the communist nations, unconstrained by
Western morality, made full use of them. He
recognised as well as anyone that a nuclear war
between the Soviet Union and the US could not
be won and would spell the end of civilisation.That, however, was precisely why he was preparedto ‘wage peace’ as he had waged war, using every
available method at his disposal.The Central Intelligence Agency under AllenDulles, the brother of Foster Dulles, was nowgiven a much expanded secret role that could notbe publicly admitted. Subversion of foreign coun-
tries became a part of the CIA’s task even while
the State Department conducted normal diplo-macy with them. Eisenhower authorised the over-throw of the Mossadeq regime, which he believedwas opening Iran and its vital oil to Soviet pene-
tration. The president authorised the covert oper-
ation (codenamed Ajax) to restore the young
pro-Western Shah to power. In carrying out Ajax,the CIA acted in concert with the Iranian army,which arrested Mossadeq and restored the Shah
in August 1953.That same year Eisenhower and Dulles becameconcerned about reports that Guatemala was ‘suc-cumbing to communist infiltration’. CentralAmerica was nearer home than Iran, and the
domino theory, though not enunciated by
Eisenhower until April 1954, was very much in
his mind. If Guatemala was allowed to fall to thecommunists, then communism would spread toits neighbours and perhaps even eventually to
Mexico and the borders of the US. This cata-
clysmic picture drove Eisenhower into action.
Colonel Jacobo Arbenz, president of Guatemalasince 1951, had embarked on a policy of eco-nomic nationalism, taking over uncultivated land
and transport and docking facilities belonging to
American corporations, of which the most pow-
erful was the United Fruit Company of Boston.
Business interests were implacably opposed toeconomic reform and, for the implementation ofhis measures, Arbenz increasingly relied on com-
munists within the trade unions and government
departments who were certainly not interested in
seeking compromises with the US. The SovietUnion saw an opportunity to ﬁsh in troubled
water. Eisenhower and Dulles concluded that the
international communist movement, by subvert-
ing Guatemala’s political and economic structure,
posed a threat to the hemisphere. Unable to per-
suade the Latin American states to take collectiveaction against Guatemala, the president called inthe CIA to organise the overthrow of Arbenz.
Exiles were armed in Honduras and with Ameri-
can air support drove Arbenz into exile, the pop-
ulation remaining passive and the Guatemalanarmy staying on the sidelines.Guatemala now fell under the control of aright-wing military dictatorship. The mass of the
country’s poor were the principal losers in these492THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
power struggles. Governed by corrupt militaryregimes, Guatemala cried out for political, socialand economic reform. The Eisenhower adminis-
tration, meanwhile, was accused of having acted
in the interests of the United Fruit Company,
which grew the bananas that constituted Guate-mala’s principal export. Yet that was untrue.Eisenhower had acted because he believed that
Guatemala was falling under communist control
and because he assumed that the strings were
being pulled by Moscow. As he saw it, he had in
1954 successfully defended the Monroe Doctrine.But the inherent weakness of American policy inGuatemala and elsewhere in Latin America lay in
the contempt felt by the right-wing militarists,
helped to power by the US, for Western demo-
cratic values, and their opposition to economicand social reforms. They were prepared to protectUS corporations, however, as part of the bargain
to gain American support. In this expectation
they were not disappointed. American aid poured
into Guatemala after the coup. The strategy ofcombating global communism, and so ensuringthat those in power professed friendship with
America, overshadowed in administration policy
the need of the great majority of Guatemalans for
basic reforms.As long as pro-American governments retainedpower in the Latin American republics, howevercorrupt or dictatorial, the Eisenhower adminis-
tration turned a blind eye and ignored the fun-
damental problems besetting the continent. Latin
American radicals were equally unrealistic inblaming the mass poverty and repressive dictator-ships entirely on the US.In Iran and Guatemala the CIA had success-fully accomplished its mission. When it began to
adopt the same technique in Cuba, however, it
experienced humiliating failure and therebydamaged the interests and prestige of the US.Cuba was ruled by another corrupt and brutal
dictator, Fulgencio Batista. Its economy was
dominated by sugar cane, whose growth and pro-
duction were owned and controlled by Americancompanies. Here also land reform and the raisingof the living standard of the poor peasantry could
not be accomplished without clashing with the
interests of American corporations. Even so, theEisenhower administration once again was moti-vated not by a desire to support the Americanowners but rather by dread of communism and
of its control from the Kremlin.Since the 1890s American administrations hadfeared that the conﬂicts in Cuba could allow apowerful European nation a base a mere ninetymiles from the coast of Florida. US interests
determined ofﬁcial attitudes to Cuban leaders and
as long as they safeguarded those interests even
brutal dictators enjoyed American support. But
there was also public sympathy in the US for FidelCastro’s revolutionary ﬁght against Batista, a sym-pathy that was combined with a growing recog-
nition that the US should support popular and
democratic regimes. The CIA, on the other hand,
warned the president of communist inﬁltration ofCastro’s guerrilla movement. On 1 January 1959Castro overthrew Batista and took control of the
government in Havana. The executions of his
opponents which followed produced a feeling of
revulsion in the US. The Cuban CommunistParty was legalised, two prominent communistassociates of Castro, Che Guevara and Antonia
Jiménez, were brought into the government and
Castro, in the Latin American tradition, made
himself the leader of the country. Clearly a leader
of charisma with genuine popular support, hepromised radical reform to the poor masses andproceeded to expropriate large estates and factor-
ies, many of which were American-owned. The
earlier American support for Batista, moreover,
had provoked strong anti-American feelings inCuba. The US responded to its perception of thepro-communist and anti-American sentiments of
Castro’s rule with a trade embargo against Cuban
sugar. But this policy of economic sanctions badly
misﬁred because it offered Russia the opening to
step into the breach by giving aid to Cuba andbuying its sugar. It also drove Castro to seekcloser relations with the Soviet Union. There was
an obvious alternative for the US which had been
frequently resorted to: intervention. Eisenhower
turned once more to the CIA. Cuban exiles weretrained in what was now friendly Guatemala tosupport a Cuban challenger to Castro. But the
Guatemalan operation could not be repeated, for
there was no exiled Cuban leader ofsufﬁcient
1THE EISENHOWER YEARS493
statureand popularity available to rally anti-Castro
political groups. Eisenhower therefore withheldhis approval of military intervention. Castro’s 
deﬁance of ‘Yankee imperialism’ meanwhile was
gaining much popular support throughout Latin
America. But the fuse that led to the Bay of Pigsin 1961 had been laid.During the two Eisenhower administrations thecredibility gap widened between the publicly pro-

fessed policy aims and the actual policies adopted
in dealing with the world’s problems. This eroded
one of Eisenhower’s main personal assets, his rep-
utation for honesty. The impact was greater onAmerican public perceptions and on America’s
allies than on the Soviet Union, whose leaders had
no high regard for capitalist moral protestations:
even without this credibility gap the Russians werenot willing to respond to Eisenhower’s various dis-
armament proposals as long as the Soviet Union
lagged behind in nuclear capability. But by making
the CIA the secret arm of US policies and greatly
extending its role, Eisenhower left a dangerouslegacy to his successors.To deter communist expansion, Eisenhowerincreasingly relied on allies in Asia and Europe to
help shoulder the burdens of fighting on the
ground as well as on America’s growing nuclear
armoury. By raising the possibility that thenuclear threshold would quickly be crossed hesought to prevent even local wars in Asia and
Europe. Nuclear weapons were stockpiled in
Western Europe, though they remained under
American control. Britain possessed its ownnuclear deterrent and France was developing anindependent nuclear striking force as well. It was
part of Eisenhower’s and Dulles’s psychological
deterrent to keep the Soviet Union, China and
the North Koreans guessing at what stage of 
conflict nuclear weapons would be used. Thepresident was fully aware of the serious conse-quences that would follow battlefield nuclear
exchanges and therefore regarded the mainte-
nance of local conventional forces as indispens-
able. But he hoped to build up West European,South Korean and Nationalist Chinese forces to obviate so far as possible reliance on Ameri-
can conventional forces. These he reduced to
strengthen the American economy, while pro-
moting alliances in Asia and in Europe and pro-viding military and economic aid. In the lastresort the US would counter communist aggres-
sion with its own nuclear capabilities.The US and the Soviet Union would survive ifnuclear weapons were used on battleﬁelds beyondtheir territories. But densely populated Germany,France and Britain, Taiwan, South Korea and
Japan, where the Western bases were located and
the armed forces assembled, would be destroyed.
So the administration had to provide an alterna-
tive strategic plan, however implausible. ThisDulles did in his famous speech to the Council ofForeign Relations on 12 January 1954, declaring
that ‘local defence had to be reinforced by the fur-
ther deterrent of massive retaliatory power’. That
last phrase, which became shortened to ‘massiveretaliation’, when coupled with other statementsthat nuclear strikes would be made against targets
of American choosing, was clearly intended to
warn Moscow and Beijing that war might not be
confined to the regions that the communistsdecided to subvert or attack. Thus the US impliedthat a communist attack on one of its allies in Asia
or Europe would lead to an American counter-
strike against China or Russia. In due course the
Soviet Union threatened the reverse. An attack
from a European base on the Soviet Union wouldlead to Soviet retaliatory attack on the US. Thusran the logic of nuclear diplomacy.Tough anti-communist speeches, Dulles’srhetoric about American readiness to go to the
brink of war and talk of rolling back communismwere part of the psychological dimension of theEisenhower administration’s foreign policy. But
these robust verbal stands also had a domestic
political purpose. Despite the cuts in the defence
budget Eisenhower wished to convince Congress
and the country that this did not mean that hisadministration was soft on communism. In par-ticular, he wished to reconcile an isolationist ‘old
guard’ of conservative Republicans in his own
party who repudiated Yalta and Roosevelt’s policy
as a sell-out to Russia and blamed Truman,Acheson and their ‘red’ advisers for the ‘loss’ ofChina.But these policies also had negative repercus-sions abroad. Dulles was misread as being ‘trigger494THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
happy’, a man who might through miscalculationplunge the world over the precipice into a nuclearholocaust. In 1954, as secret British Cabinet
minutes reveal, one senior minister in Churchill’s
government thought that Dulles was a greater
danger to world peace than the Russians. It was a sentiment shared throughout the world.Furthermore, the Soviet leaders were made to feel
Russia’s technological inferiority, especially in the
nuclear field. Was this wise? With a national
economy far weaker than America’s, the Russian
leaders redoubled their efforts to convince the USthat America’s economic superiority did not meanthat the Soviet Union was bound to remain mil-
itarily the weaker. The Soviet Union and the US
began to stockpile nuclear weapons in such quan-
tities that they would be able to destroy eachother’s population centres several times over.Though the USSR in the 1950s had fewernuclear weapons than the US, it switched suc-
cessfully from aircraft to rockets. It tested the ﬁrst
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in 1957but serious problems remained to be overcomeand they were not deployed until the 1960s. The
Soviet Union concentrated on Western Europe
ﬁrst, where its more reliable intermediate ballistic
missiles were targeted in ever increasing numbers
from 1959. The Russians had scored a psycho-logical victory when on 5 October 1957 they hadsent the first earth satellite, Sputnik, through
space. After early failures an American satellite was
successfully launched from Cape Canaveral three
months later in January 1958. But the Soviet sci-entiﬁc ﬁrst gave a rude jolt to American conﬁ-dence and created the myth that the US was
lagging behind and that Eisenhower had allowed
a ‘missile gap’ to develop. In this way propaganda
and achievement stimulated the nuclear-arms race
from the 1950s onwards.The impression America gave of ruthlessness,even recklessness, in being prepared to escalate
every local conﬂict between communist and non-
communist nations to all-out nuclear conﬂict was
in fact a false one. Both the Soviet Union and theUS clung to the need for the ultimate deterrent,but Eisenhower and Malenkov (and his successor
Khrushchev) were agreed that nuclear war offered
no hope of victory to either side. A ﬁrst surprisestrike would not eliminate all the nuclear capa-bilities of the other side, so sufficient nuclearweapons would remain to inﬂict a catastrophic
retaliatory strike on the attacker. By the mid-
1950s a new era in superpower relations and so
in world history had thus been reached. It isgraphically summed up by three letters: MAD, ormutual assured destruction. The fact that a
nuclear exchange would destroy both countries
thereafter dominated Soviet–American relations.
Their awesome nuclear capabilities make direct
war between them inconceivable. Unhappily,however, wars were not banished between smallernations.What Eisenhower and Dulles achieved duringthe years from January 1953 to the end of the
Eisenhower presidency in January 1961 was toend American involvement in the Korean War andto keep the US out of further conﬂict. The con-
trast between bellicose rhetoric and the actual
record became evident as early as the ﬁrst year of
the administration when on Stalin’s death the ﬁrstcracks in Soviet control became visible in EastGermany.There was not even a hint that military actionwould be taken by the US on behalf of Soviet
satellites that rebelled. On 16 and 17 June 1953
Berlin workers rose in revolt against their com-munist regime. Throughout Eastern Germanyother industrial towns followed. If its rhetoric
meant anything, this was the moment for the
West, led by the US, to respond to appeals for
help. There was a short, chaotic interlude whilethe East German regime showed itself quiteunable to suppress the rising. Then the Russians,
who had large troop concentrations on the spot,
intervened and quickly quelled the revolt. Apart
from offering pious declarations of moral support,
the US did nothing. It was a tacit admission thatan acceptance of the divisions agreed at Yalta wasthe basis of continuing peace, and that great-
power intervention in the sphere assigned to the
other side carried with it the risk of nuclear war.
In reality there could be no rolling back of fron-tiers by force. But Radio Free Europe, ﬁnancedalmost entirely by the CIA, nevertheless kept up
the barrage of propaganda directed towards
Eastern Europe.1THE EISENHOWER YEARS495
While Europe was seen as the primary scene ofaction in the Cold War, America’s Western allieswere fighting communism in Asia: Britain in
Malaya, and France in Indo-China (as Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia were then known). Eisen-
hower shared the traditional American antipathytowards colonialism, which was seen as a sin con-ﬁned mainly to the old European empires. The
granting of independence, the president believed,
would undermine the support the communists
were receiving in their ﬁght against the French.
On the other hand, he also agreed with FosterDulles that the national communist struggles inthat part of Asia were controlled by the Kremlin,
which could call them off if it wished. The Soviet
purpose, they believed, was to weaken the West.
Eisenhower concluded that the US would be play-ing the Kremlin’s game if it allowed its armedforces to become embroiled in the endless land
mass of Asia. Instead, the US would provide
ﬁnance, arms and advice to European and Asian
allies to ﬁght their own wars against communistexpansion. The question left unanswered waswhat should be done if America’s allies proved too
weak or too unwilling to resist. American percep-
tions also over-simplified the problems con-
fronting Beijing and Moscow, whose control over
events in their spheres of inﬂuence was not nearlyas complete as the US believed.The French struggle in Vietnam went frombad to worse. The greater the effort the French
devoted militarily in Vietnam, moreover, the less
would be their capacity to play their part in thedefence of Western Europe against the SovietUnion. Military logic suggested that they should
pull out. Yet the defence of Vietnam too seemed
vital. Dulles and Eisenhower subscribed to the
domino theory, that if Vietnam fell to the com-
munists then the rest of south Asia would be lost.But increased American aid to France was notturning the tide. By 1954 the French wanted not
only US bombers but also the personnel to keep
them flying. And so in response Eisenhower,
despite his misgivings, sent the ﬁrst American ser-vicemen to Vietnam. He was still determined,however, to keep America out of any large-scale
involvement: his military judgement was against
it and furthermore he did not wish to identify theUS with a colonialist cause. The key struggle inthe spring of 1954 was taking place around thefortified French position at Dien Bien Phu,
invested by the Vietminh.In March and April 1954 the French requestedthe direct intervention of American armed forces,but Eisenhower procrastinated. There was eventalk of using atomic bombs: this he rejected deci-
sively. Dien Bien Phu surrendered on 7 May
1954. Eisenhower now accepted the inevitability
of a compromise peace, a partition of Vietnam
that would draw a new line against communistexpansion. He had made peace in Korea; hewould not start a new war in Vietnam, with the
US taking over the role of France.By the time of Dien Bien Phu’s fall the GenevaConference (attended by France, Britain, theSoviet Union, the People’s Republic of China andboth Vietnams) had already been in session for
some days. Realising that the US was not going to
provide the military help needed to win the war
against the Vietminh, the French decided to makethe best bargain they could with the Vietnamesecommunists. While negotiations dragged on in
Geneva the French and Americans thought they
faced the danger that Ho Chi-minh would order
his victorious forces to drive the French out of the
whole of Vietnam. In Washington, in May 1954,a real war-scare ballooned. The National SecurityCouncil came to the drastic conclusion that US
power should not be used in defence of south-east
Asia but should be directed against ‘the source of
the peril’, China, ‘and that in this connectionatomic weapons should be used’. Dulles appearedto agree, saying that any Chinese intervention in
Vietnam would be the ‘equivalent of a declaration
of war against the US’. In the supercharged
Washington atmosphere, Eisenhower now proved
that he was his own man. At this fateful momentin world history it was fortunate that the presidentwas a man of great military prestige. An all-out
nuclear war, Eisenhower told the joint chiefs of
staff, would have to be fought not only against
China but also against its ally, Russia. He broughthis advisers back to reality with a rhetorical ques-tion: ‘If Russia were destroyed, what would be the
result of such a victory?’ From the Elbe to
Vladivostock there would be starvation and disas-496THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
ter, no government or communications. ‘I askyou’, Eisenhower challenged his military chiefs,‘what would the civilised world do about it?’ He
then supplied the answer, ‘I repeat, there is no vic-
tory except through our imaginations.’ In charge
of policy at this critical time for the world, thepresident firmly rejected the use of atomicweapons in Asia and refused to consider wild
notions of launching a pre-emptive nuclear war
against Russia or China.The superiority the US enjoyed in stockpilesof nuclear weapons in the 1950s could beemployed only in defence of the West’s most vitalinterests, not to attack weaker opponents.
Eisenhower would have used them if the Red
Army had attempted to overrun Western Europe
or if China had invaded Taiwan or, improbably,had attacked Japan. But for Eisenhower their realvalue lay in their deterrent effect – he was not
trigger happy and prayed they would never be
used. Yet he did not believe peace in Asia could
be restored by peaceful negotiation and compro-mise. That, in the president’s judgement, was theappeasement policy of Munich. When in July
1954 an armistice was ﬁnally concluded at Geneva
between the North Vietnamese and the French,
and Vietnam was partitioned close to the 17th
parallel, the US would not participate in thesettlement because it left the future of the wholeof Vietnam to be settled by elections in 1956.In 1954 Eisenhower’s and Dulles’s main effort was directed to bringing to life an Asian
defensive alliance similar to NATO in Europe. By September the South-East Asian CollectiveDefence Treaty was concluded and signed in
Manila by the US, Britain, France, Australia, New
Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines.
It promised self-help and mutual aid to develop
the signatories’ individual and collective capacityto resist armed attack or subversion; an attack onone was held to be a threat to all, and the allies
undertook to act to meet the common danger.
Cambodia, Laos and South Vietnam were
included in the region to be defended. ButSEATO never achieved the credibility of NATO.There was no automatic provision of military aid
and Britain and France withdrew from providing
any military support.The contrast between Europe and Asia in the1950s and after is striking. NATO became aneffective alliance; SEATO did not, but relied for
its teeth on the US. In Europe policy decisions
had to be shared with allies where questions of
European defence were concerned. In Asia, theUS took its own decisions in the face of lukewarmsupport from Western European allies. US policy
fulﬁlled most of its aims in Western Europe. For
example, it was largely American pressure and
Adenauer’s unequivocal decision to side with the
Western powers that restored the FederalRepublic to full sovereignty and brought it tomembership of NATO in 1955. And, despite
threats and diplomatic confrontations, there was
no war between communist states and the West in
Europe. The Asian peoples, by contrast, sufferedturmoil and wars. America, after Eisenhower leftthe presidency, became increasingly involved in
the renewed Vietnamese Civil War.In 1956, the hollowness of the political rhetoric of‘freeing the enslaved nations’ from communistcontrol was so forcibly exposed that it was not seri-

ously employed again. The Soviet Union proved
itself strong enough to impose its will on the cen-

tral and Eastern European nations. In October of
that year the Poles deﬁed the Russians, and this
encouraged the Hungarians, who took the notionof independence from Soviet control much fur-

ther. During the last week of that month ﬁght-

ing broke out between Soviet troops and the
Hungarians. Unbelievably, the Russians withdrewfrom Budapest only to return in force on Sunday,3 November 1956. Eisenhower, with Dulles in
hospital after his ﬁrst operation for cancer, was

dealing simultaneously with the problems of the
British–French–Israeli war against Egypt, with the
Hungarian revolution and with his approaching re-election (6 November). Increasingly desperateHungarian appeals for American help were rejected
by Eisenhower, although the CIA were eager to
supply air drops of arms. Eisenhower acknow-
ledged that Hungary lay within the Soviet orbitand that the Soviet Union might well prefer toﬁght rather than accept the disintegration of the
Warsaw Pact. The US thus conﬁned itself to reso-

lutions that would be vetoed by the Russians in the1THE EISENHOWER YEARS497
UN, and to accepting some of the Hungarianrefugees ﬂeeing across the Austrian frontier.Eisenhower’s and Dulles’s Middle Easternpolicies were less successful. America’s overriding
concern was to keep the Soviet Union out of this
vital region with its huge oil reserves, though theUS also wished to be regarded as the friend ofthe Arabs, sympathetic to their strivings to free
themselves from a semi-colonial status, above all
in relation to Britain. But the unstinting support
the US gave to Israel aroused Arab suspicion and
hostility. Moreover, Britain was America’s mostimportant ally in Europe. The US could notescape the inconsistencies in its position. None-
theless, each policy sought to preserve the peace
and the post-1949 status quo in the region. These
aims served the interests of Britain too, and thetwo countries worked together to this end untiltheir cooperation became undone in the after-
math of Suez.Eisenhower and Dulles had coordinated theirpolicy with Eden to combat Nasser, who wasleaning to Moscow. They agreed in the spring of1956 to withdraw their ﬁnancial backing for the
Aswan High Dam, making this public in July, and
when Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal Dulles
exerted what pressure he could to coordinate the
international reaction. Eisenhower and Dulleswanted to get rid of Nasser, but not at the priceof arousing the whole Arab world against the
West. They were, therefore, unenthused by
British suggestions that military action could
become necessary. They urged caution and delay.But Britain and France in collusion with Israelwent ahead on 31 October with the bombing of
Egypt and kept Washington in the dark about
their precise military plans.Suez represented a serious crisis in the US’srelationship with its principal European allies.After some initial hesitation Eisenhower decidedthat he had to try to end the British–French–
Israeli invasion of Egypt and so backed a UN call
for a ceaseﬁre in November 1956. He exploited
Britain’s financial weakness to force the EdenCabinet to accept the UN resolution. The Israelisand the French bowed to the inevitable. The US
managed to mend fences with Britain the follow-
ing year, but there was no disguising that indealing with Nasser’s Egypt, American diplomacyhad been inconsistent.After Suez, despite efforts to persuade theinvaders to withdraw, the US did not gain many
plaudits from the Arab world. US policy in the
Middle East continued to be hampered by thequestion of how support for Israel could be rec-onciled with Arab friendship. Then in 1958 the
US landed troops in the Lebanon, at the same
time pronouncing the Eisenhower Doctrine
which committed the Americans to providing
help to Middle Eastern states threatened by com-munist aggression or subversion. As this did notreflect the reality of the conflicts within the
Middle East, the doctrine was ineffectual. But
uncertainty about how best to handle the Middle
East in the light of America’s conﬂicting interestswas not unique to the Eisenhower administra-tions and continued long after.During his two terms (1953–7 and 1957–61)as president, Eisenhower, skilfully supported by
Dulles, was generally able to establish clear USpolicies for the rest of the decade and beyond.There could be no military intervention in the
regions of the world under effective Soviet and
Chinese military control, even when rebellion
broke out within the Soviet camp. In Europe, the
US was committed to the defence of the NATOalliance countries. In Asia, the defensive line hadbeen drawn close to the Chinese mainland, pro-
tecting the islands of Quemoy and Matsu as well
as Taiwan. In August and September 1958 a new
crisis broke out with mainland China over the off-shore islands, which Chiang Kai-shek, who stillbelieved that internal disruption would allow 
him to reconquer China, had heavily reinforced.
When the Chinese communists blockaded and
shelled the islands, he saw an opportunity of
embroiling the US in a war with China. Eisen-hower ordered the Seventh Fleet to sail in supportof the Nationalist Chinese, but once again he
scotched the advice of the joint chiefs of staff to
use atomic weapons against mainland China. Mao
Zedong and Zhou Enlai abandoned their assaulton the islands, thus ending all question of a warwith China. But Eisenhower continued Truman’s
policy of refusing to recognise the communist
republic as the legitimate state of China. With498THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
American support, Chiang Kai-shek’s Taiwancontinued to occupy China’s seat on the SecurityCouncil of the United Nations. Meanwhile, in
south-east Asia, SEATO defined the limits of
Chinese and communist expansion, and in the
Middle East the Baghdad Pact created a militarybarrier along the frontiers between Turkey, Iranand the Soviet Union supported by Iraq and
Pakistan.The future of Germany was a critical problem forboth the East and the West, as well as for theGermans. Was there any real possibility of disen-gagement and agreement, of German uniﬁcation
on conditions of neutrality? Soviet leaders from
Stalin to Khrushchev strove to achieve this objec-
tive as long as the Soviet regime in East Germanywas preserved. The Soviet Union above allattempted to prevent West German rearmament
and integration in NATO. To this end Khrush-
chev worked hard to relax tension in Europe.
Eisenhower asked for proof of Soviet sincerity, forexample the conclusion of an Austrian peacetreaty, which had been fruitlessly discussed for
years. A few weeks later, to the West’s astonish-
ment, Khrushchev agreed and the Austrian Treaty
was signed in May 1955. But the subsequent
Geneva Conference in July of that year made noreal progress on the more important Germanquestion. Eisenhower rejected the principle,
insisted on by Khrushchev, that a unified
Germany could not join NATO. Khrushchev in
turn refused to accept Eisenhower’s ‘open skies’proposal, under which the Americans couldinspect Soviet military sites and vice versa. Nor
was the nuclear-arms race halted. But Khrushchev
and Eisenhower did agree to conduct relations in
a conciliatory spirit – the so-called ‘spirit of
Geneva’. The ﬁrst stage of detente had begun.But it did not last long: there were warlikeexchanges during the Suez Crisis of 1956; rela-
tions were strained by the Eisenhower Doctrine
in the Middle East; and new tensions arose when
in November 1958 the mercurial Soviet leaderthreatened that the Soviet Union would concludea peace treaty with East Germany and end
Western rights in Berlin. But Khrushchev
remained personally friendly, inviting Eisenhowerto visit the Soviet Union. Eisenhower respondedby indicating to Khrushchev that, providedWestern interests were preserved, he was ready to
negotiate over Berlin and German uniﬁcation and
over an atomic test-ban treaty. Test-ban negotia-
tions were accordingly started in Geneva, andKhrushchev postponed the unilateral alteration ofBerlin’s status. Eisenhower wanted to crown his
presidency as it drew to its close by establishing
a ﬁrm basis for world peace. John Foster Dulles’s
last illness had reduced his inﬂuence, though he
was careful to warn Eisenhower against adoptingany policy that smacked of appeasement. In May1959 Dulles died and was replaced as secretary of
state by Christian Herter.Detente seemed assured when Khrushchevaccepted Eisenhower’s invitation to visit the US inSeptember 1959. It was an unprecedented eventfor a Kremlin leader to come to see for himself the
country perceived by the Soviet Union as the
leader of the anti-communist capitalist bloc of
powers. The visit was a success, though Khrush-
chev tried not to show that he was impressed bythe achievements of capitalism. He and Eisen-
hower agreed to hold a summit meeting in Paris
the following May, after which Eisenhower and his
family were to visit the Soviet Union.Eisenhower’s hopes were soon to be dashed byKhrushchev. The US had since 1955 been sendingspy planes over the Soviet Union at such high alti-
tudes that the Russians could not bring them
down. But just before the Paris summit was to
take place in May 1960 they at last succeeded inshooting one down with a missile. Believing thepilot dead and the plane destroyed, the US admin-
istration impaled itself on the falsehood that the
plane – the U-2 – was a weather-research plane
that had strayed off course. The Russians then tri-
umphantly displayed the captured pilot togetherwith incontrovertible evidence that the plane wasspying. Khrushchev, who had arrived by this time
for the conference in Paris, demanded an apol-
ogy and a statement from Eisenhower that the
spying missions had been conducted without the president’s knowledge. They had not. But thepresident was not to be caught in a lie, nor trapped
in a position where he had to admit publicly that
he did not know what was going on. So, unable to1THE EISENHOWER YEARS499
humiliate Eisenhower, Khrushchev broke off thesummit meeting before it had got properlystarted. Not that the U-2 issue was a new one: the
Russians had known about these missions for
three years. In any case, satellites from both sides
would soon be able to pass unimpeded over anyregion they chose. Possibly Khrushchev had sim-ply decided that there was no point in dealing with
a president in the last months of his administra-
tion, and that it would be necessary to postpone
serious negotiations.Eisenhower had dominated the Western side in global international relations for eight years.His greatest achievement was a negative one: to
have resisted all temptation to use atomic weapons
and to start a war against China, as some of 
his advisers had urged. Nor had he panicked hiscountry into seeking excessive nuclear-weaponsleadership over the USSR. And although hewanted genuine disarmament, it is difficult to see how he could have halted the arms race, given the circumstances and the fears prevailing 
at the time. In his memorable ‘farewell’ address 
he alerted his countrymen to the power of the
industrial–military establishment, which hadgrown up as a result of the Cold War, and warnedof the ‘potential for the disastrous rise of mis-
placed power’, which should never be allowed to
‘endanger our liberties or democratic processes’.
Both the armaments industry and the military, he
believed, would always demand more than wasnecessary.It was fortunate for the world that a presidentof unchallengeable military prestige was in a posi-
tion to control a military establishment prone to
advocating, at times of crisis, policies that mighthave endangered the peace of the world in thenuclear age.500THE COLD WAR: SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION, 1948–64
1Part XI
THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN
EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
No one could have foreseen the remarkable trans-formation undergone by a defeated Germany in
just one decade. Two Germanies had emerged by
the 1950s, military allies of their former enemies,Russia, Britain, the US and France. Germans inthe West were no longer treated with contempt
and condescension but were admired for the dis-
cipline and hard work that had restored their
prosperity. Not that both halves of Germany
prospered equally. The free-market economy inthe Western part proved itself to be far more efﬁ-cient in the production of wealth than the state-
planned economy of the Eastern third. The
Democratic Republic was a truncated state: the
former German agricultural and industrial terri-tories east of the Oder–Neisse had been lost toPoland and the Soviet Union. In 1945 some 17
million Germans lived in the Soviet zone, the later
Democratic Republic, and nearly 44 million in
the Western zones. Twenty years later, together
with their respective parts of Berlin, the prepon-derance of West Germany over East had becomeeven greater; almost 60 million were living in the
Federal Republic and West Berlin, and 17 million
in the DDR including East Berlin. The two
Germanies provided something like a test of therelative efﬁciency of the Western economies andthe command economies of the East, given that
both of these new states were starting from much
the same base in 1945.The results were little short of astonishing.Progress was certainly made in the East, but thedisparity in wealth, let alone liberty and quality oflife, between the countries grew with every
passing year. Just how backward the DDR had
become was hidden from the West until the collapse of the East German state in 1990.Before the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 mil-lions had walked to the freedom of the West.
They tended to be young, more active and more
enterprising. With barbed wire, control towers
and orders to shoot, the East German regime sur-vived almost another three decades. It is possiblethat without the fortiﬁed barrier between East
and West the DDR would have collapsed before
from a haemorrhage of its active population
seeking a better life in the West.The transition to parliamentary democracy inthe West seemed smooth, the path almost too
easy. In the early years of occupation the Allied
authorities still had much suspicion of German
grass-roots revanchism. At least one generation
had to pass before support for the democraticinstitutions of the Federal Republic becamesomething more than opportunism for the major-
ity and turned into a conviction that democratic
values were worth defending. The concerns of the
adult population in the immediate post-war yearswere necessarily materialistic: to put together thebare necessities for family life and after that to
gain a share of the good things – a home, furni-
ture, enough to eat, a refrigerator, a car.The Germans were also asked in the 1950s tohelp defend the West. The sudden change in1Chapter 46WEST GERMANYECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICALSTABILITY
Allied attitudes on the issue of German rearma-ment was not universally popular, since only a fewyears before German militarism had been con-
demned as the root of all evil. But the Second
World War had brought about a great change in
German thinking: if a third world war broke out,it would be fought in Germany, and everyoneunderstood that it would totally destroy the
country. Militarism was dead. Indeed, in the
1950s, a strong extra-parliamentary movement
opposed to rearmament made itself felt.The Federal German Republic had a betterstart than Weimar, because its birth in May 1949did not coincide with the hour of defeat, as had
that of the Weimar Republic. Instead, it was the
Allies and their occupation policies that were
blamed for the hardship of the early years. Theevolution of a fully sovereign parliamentarydemocratic state was a gradual one that was not
completed until six years later in 1955. Political
parties, assemblies and administrations had been
set up in ten Länder(regional territories), thoughWest Berlin was not included in the FederalRepublic. In the spring of 1948, France, Britain
and the US had agreed to the formation of a
central German government for the Western
zones, but ultimate powers still remained in the
hands of the three Allied governments. The minister presidents of the Länderwere invited tocall a constituent assembly to draft a constitution.
But the minister presidents, fearing that this
would make the division of Germany permanent,
would agree only to call a ‘council’ and to drafta ‘basic law’, thus emphasising the transitionalnature of what they were doing: Germany would
not have a constitution until it was reunited. The
two major parties, the SPD and the CDU/CSU,
sent the same number of delegates to the parlia-
mentary council; Adenauer by astute managementsecured the presidency, so establishing an ascen-dancy in German politics that was to last for
ﬁfteen years.Given the bitter personal relations and conﬂictbetween the SPD and the CDU/CSU, not tomention the deep divisions within the partiesthemselves over the extent of federal powers, over
regional self-government, over voting procedures
and over a host of other practical questions, theframing of an agreed basic law was a remarkableachievement. Behind all these questions always layassessments of how, eventually, complete sover-
eignty could be achieved and how reuniﬁcation
could be brought about. Reuniﬁcation was still
the goal; it appeared unthinkable then thatGermany would remain divided for long.The Basic Law, or West German constitution,stood the test of time and by the 1980s had lost
its provisional appearance just when it turned out
to be, indeed, provisional. Voting was by a com-
bination of proportional representation (with can-didates drawn from party lists in each of theLänder) and constituency representation bysimple majority; a barrier was created on the
Länderlist, so that no party with less than 5 percent of the vote in the Federal Republic could wina seat in the parliament, the Bundestag (although,if three seats were won in direct constituency elec-
tions in one Land, the per cent rule was set aside).Presidential powers, largely ceremonial were less
extensive than those held by the presidents of theWeimar Republic. The chancellor became themost powerful member of the executive; he and
his government could gain office only if he
enjoyed the support of a parliamentary majority.
But a vote against him by a majority would bring
about his fall only if the Bundestag could agreeby majority on a successor. The rationale for this‘constructive vote of no confidence’ was to
prevent a repetition of the extinction of Weimar,
brought about by the combination of two anti-
democratic parties, the National Socialists and thecommunists. The constitution could be changedonly by a two-thirds majority and was buttressed
by nineteen articles defining inviolable funda-

mental rights; a constitutional court was set up to
decide claims that the constitution was not being
observed. Legislation by the elected Bundestagcould be delayed by the Bundesrat, a secondchamber to which the Ländersent representativesand whose purpose is to scrutinise legislation
which affects particularly the Länder.The constitution is a long and complex docu-ment and only its salient features are heredescribed. As a written constitution embodying
individual rights and a constitutional court to
enforce them, it provides safeguards against their504THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
abuse by simple party majorities in the parlia-
mentary assembly. The strong element of pro-portional representation allows a voice for the
views of those who do not wish to choose
between the two mass parties. The 5 per cent rule
prevents the proliferation of small parties, whichdestabilised Weimar and has undermined govern-ments in Italy; on the other hand, proportional
representation can allow too much inﬂuence to a
minority. In most years since 1949, the two major
parties could gain a majority only with the help
of a third party, the Free Democratic Party, whichcould bargain with either in order to gain itsobjectives and switch support accordingly.No constitution is perfect; its success dependson the politicians and the parties who bring it to
life, and on the attitude of the electorate towardsthe government and the institutions establishedunder it. The Federal Republic has enjoyed great
stability in good times and, more importantly, 
in bad.The German Socialist Party (SPD) was the mostcoherent and best-organised mass party to put
itself before the electorate when the first
Bundestag elections were held in 1949. Despite a
tendency to strong central leadership, local and
district organisations during the subsequent fourdecades acted as ginger groups and at times stoodwell to the left of the party leadership. This
became especially true of the young socialists after
the revolt of youth in the 1960s. A serious hand-
icap for the party was the separation from theFederal Republic of Berlin and the Soviet zone,which had traditionally been the stronghold of
the Social Democratic Party. Their leader in 1949
was Kurt Schumacher, passionate and autocratic
in style, but his suffering in concentration camps
had undermined his health, and he died in August1952, only three years after the elections. Hestood for a clear, uncompromising policy in both
domestic and international affairs. His opposition
to communism was total and he ensured that the
Western SPD would have no truck with the com-munists. Schumacher’s socialism had its basis inethics: his appeal was a moral one, for the bet-
terment of the majority, of the poorer sections of
society, for an end to the exploitation by capitalof labour, of working people. But the partystressed that socialism without democracy wouldonly lead back to the dark years of Hitler’s total-
itarianism or to Soviet tyranny. The British
Labour Party was the model. Two other planks in
the party programme were important: a stronganti-clericalism, which condemned interferenceby the Church in politics and education, and an
insistence on the recovery of national independ-
ence for all of Germany, not just for the Western
zones. The SPD wanted to be seen as the patri-
otic party. This stance led to the most bitterclashes with the governing Christian Democrats.The Christian Democrats were less coherentthan the Social Democrats, even to the extent of
avoiding the label ‘party’ and calling themselves a
‘movement’ (union). They too set out to learn thelessons of the Hitler years. Politics should beanchored in ethical values, not vaguely but
speciﬁcally in Christian ethics. Yet the Christian
Democrats would not become a narrow Catholic
party. From its foundation Protestants participatedwith Catholics in its organisation. ChristianDemocratsalsochampioned parliamentarydemoc-

racy and saw in communism the principal threat 
to civil liberties in the West. They were ﬁercely

anti-Marxist, vociferous in their opposition to class
warfare and state ownership of production. TheRhineland CDU, with its strong industrial Ruhrbase, was overwhelmingly Catholic and led suc-

cessful efforts to align the party with policies limit-

ing the exclusion of workers from the exercise of
power and its concentration in the hands of indus-
trialists. Worker participation in industrial man-
agement became one of the planks of the CDU in
the 1950s and so attracted support from sections
of the trade unions. Capitalism was to be modiﬁed

and restricted: industrial policies would be based
on free enterprise, but the social good would be taken into account. The CDU’s sister party, the Bavarian CSU, has traditionally represented
more conservative views. Adenauer, more conser-

vative than the Rhinelanders he led, skilfully rec-

onciled the different elements, moving the party to the centre-right in doing so. Until his last few years der Alte(the Old One, a term of affec-
tionate respect) stood head and shoulders above
his party colleagues; he succeeded in putting his1WEST GERMANY505
stamp on a broad pragmatic party that couldattract progressive liberals, trade unionists, farmersand conservatives.Adenauer had lived through the agony of thelast years of Weimar, when the splintering of
parties had been one factor in bringing Hitler topower in 1933. He had no high opinion of thedemocratic instincts of his fellow Germans. Their
tendency to form religious, political and interest
groups, which zealously pursued their aims
without regard to the destructive effects on the
polity as a whole, had left Adenauer with the con-viction that strong leadership was necessary. Heknew his people, their strengths and weaknesses,
and so was determined that the CDU/CSU
should draw its support from a broad cross-
section of conservatives and liberals and of allclasses and religions. This would isolate the irrec-oncilables, even if they breached the 5 per cent
electoral barrier.To the left of the CDU, but opposed to social-ism, stood the Free Democratic (Liberal) Party(the FDP), whose programmes were a differentmix of compromises to those of the CDU: theyagreed with the SPD in wishing to exclude cleri-cal inﬂuence but concurred with the CDU in sup-
porting an ethical or social-market economy.
Other parties gaining more than 5 per cent have
come and generally gone. Despite many internaldivisions, the Green Party, emphasising thedangers of relentless industrial exploitation of the
environment, especially from nuclear power
plants, and advocating a more anarchic, grass-
roots democracy, have survived longer than many
political commentators prophesied when theywere ﬁrst formed in 1980, becoming partners ofSPD governments in the late 1990s and early
twenty-ﬁrst century.The ﬁrst elections for the Bundestag in August1949 confounded the expectation of pollsters andothers that amid general hardship the SocialDemocrats would win and that Kurt Schumacher
would form the ﬁrst government as chancellor.
Schumacher had fought a strident campaign, den-
igrating the policies of the CDU and the bigbosses, and asserting Germany’s right to self-506THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s

Now, he declared,was the German people’s chance to break deci-sively with the social structures, the politics, the
economic policies and the interfering clerics that
had brought a Hitler to power. These policies
attracted 6,935,000 votes, not only from the poorand the working classes. But the broad coalitionrepresented by the CDU/CSU gained 2 per cent
more votes. Why had the SPD lost? Schumacher
had attacked the opposition on too many fronts
and had alienated voters, among them a number
of the Catholic workers of the Ruhr. The resultwas very close, but it proved a decisive turningpoint. Had Adenauer listened to a chorus of
advice that with so small a majority a ‘general
coalition’ of CDU and SPD should be formed,
parliamentary democracy might have been stran-gled at birth. Many politicians did not understandthis, and such coalitions existed in the Länder,forcing the small remaining opposition into impo-
tence. Instead Adenauer was determined to
follow policies that would be in clear contrast to
those of the opposition, the ‘socialists’.The CDU/CSU had emerged as the largestparty thanks to its broad approach and its com-
promises with capitalism, mainly worked out by
Professor Ludwig Erhard, who called his system
a ‘social-market economy’. Free enterprise andcompetition on the American model would createnational wealth, but working people would be
protected by wide-ranging social-security meas-
ures guaranteed by the state. The economic man-
agement by the occupying powers had been
rigidly planned and controlled. As far as the Allieswould allow, Erhard (though no more than anadviser) had daringly made a bonﬁre of controlsand set the Germans free to choose. The currencyreform of 1948 was another key aspect, substi-
tuting for the worthless old marks a small circu-
lation of sound Deutsche Marks. Overnight the
shop windows ﬁlled up with goods, conﬁdence inthe currency returned, and after an early periodof inﬂation prices stabilised by the time of the
elections. Erhard’s policies and the injection of
Marshall Aid were beginning to lift the economy.
Living conditions were still harsh but they were
getting better.As long as the SPD remained restricted by itssocialist doctrines (which it was until 1959), it
could achieve no more than 40 per cent of the
vote; on the other hand, CDU/CSU was strong
enough only in 1957 to govern without the coali-tion support of other parties; its main partner wasthe FDP. This allowed the FDP a role in German
politics far greater than the electoral support it
could muster, which reached at best about 10 per
cent. The communists barely passed the 5 percent barrier in 1949; in 1953 they could notmanage even that and so lost their representation
in the Bundestag; banned until 1969 on the
ground that the party did not support the demo-
cratic state, its support (less than 1 per cent)
thereafter remained too small to regain represen-tation in the Bundestag.Adenauer so dominated German politics from1949 to 1963 that the period came to be referred
to as the Adenauer era. These years irrevocablydetermined the course of German history, whichchanges of government and international condi-
tions could only modify before 1990. As chan-
cellor he followed a clear course, exhibiting an
unblinkered view of the morality and behaviour
of the majority of the electorate and the particu-lar needs of the new West German state.The most immediate need was to extricate theFederal Republic from its leading strings: the
Ruhr, with its steel and coal production, had been
placed under an international authority; the Saarhad voted to remain in close association withFrance; the Federal Republic itself was not per-
mitted to follow an independent foreign policy.
It was still bound to the Allies by the Occupation1WEST GERMANY507

Statute (10 April 1949), which reserved supremepower to the US, France and Great Britain, actingthrough their high commissioners. The Federal
Republic was not truly sovereign in September
1949, but was on probation.Adenauer made concessions and obtainedsome in return. He realised that he must win thetotal trust of the Western Allies as a precondition
for regaining complete sovereignty. For all his
rhetoric about German unity, he did not seriously
believe it possible that the Soviet Union would
withdraw and grant genuine freedom of choice tothe German people living in the Soviet zone.After twelve years of Nazi totalitarian rule, the
German people in the Federal Republic would
have to learn and experience the blessings of
democracy and civil liberty for some years andresist any temptation to compromise with theSoviet Union or to enter partnership with com-
munists as the price of unity. In the world of 
the 1950s, Adenauer saw a choice that had 
tobe unequivocally made: between falling into
the grip of the communist-dominated East andforming the closest possible association with the
Western states prepared to defend their freedom.
There was no neutral road. Moreover, Adenauer
reﬂected in his memoirs, ‘It was my conviction
that the only way for our country and people toregain their freedom lay in close agreement andco-operation with the high commissioners.’ But
the Germans were not necessarily prostrate, nor
completely dependent on Allied goodwill. With
Cold War tensions reaching a climax, the US wasnot about to leave West Europe, as it hadintended to do in 1944 and 1945; Adenauer
understood that in such conditions it was in
America’s own vital interests to create a strong
Western Europe, and for this, as he wrote in his
memoirs, Germany was indispensable: ‘A countryin shackles is not a real, full partner. I thereforethought that our fetters would gradually fall
away.’ He recognised that ‘the most important
prerequisite for partnership is trust’.With tenacity and skill Adenauer exploited hiscountry’s position. He had to work simultane-ously on many fronts: to assure the Americans of
his anti-communist commitment, to point out to
the three Western Allies that the dismantling ofGerman industry must stop and that growingGerman prosperity was essential to their ownwell-being; to stress that they, especially the
French, need never fear a revival of German
nationalism and aggression; and to demonstrate
that Germany would contribute to WesternEuropean unity and defence and would work forthe common good. At the same time the German
people would have to be convinced of the bene-
ﬁts, above all the material ones, that would be
conferred by these policies. Adenauer needed to
be ﬂexible, adroit, sometimes tough, sometimesready to agree to disadvantageous bargains, ableto assess correctly the feelings of his neigh-
bours, while proceeding step by step to fulﬁl his
major objectives. Meanwhile from the opposition
benches he was assailed by Schumacher – sound-ing a strident nationalist note and rejecting con-ciliation with France – as the ‘chancellor of the
Allies’. But Adenauer could show results. In 1950
West Germany became a member of the Council
of Europe; the dismantling of German industrywas ﬁrst slowed down, then halted. Then in May1950 the chancellor responded with warmth to
the French proposals known as the Schuman Plan
to place the French and German production of
coal and steel under a joint high authority and to
invite other states to join. Jean Monnet had putforward the idea as a practical means to bringWestern Europe into a federation of states and to
remove forever French and German fears of
aggression since neither country could build up
armaments against the other without nationalcontrol of its heavy industries. The problem of the Ruhr as a source of French anxiety was
thereby imaginatively solved. Italy, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg participated in the
Paris negotiations. These were completed in April
1951 and Adenauer paid his ﬁrst visit to Paris tosign the momentous European Coal and SteelCommunity Treaty; it was the ﬁrst step towards
the formation in 1958 of the European Economic
Community of the six. In Paris, Adenauer was the
ﬁrst ofﬁcial representative of the new Germanstate to be received as a friend. He had movedsteadily forward despite hostile French moves in
1950 designed to ensure that the Saar would
become French. Patience was rewarded: the508THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
Saarlanders were given the opportunity to vote torejoin West Germany; just as material interestshad ﬁrst turned them towards France, they now,
in 1957, voted to join the Federal Republic as the
tenth of the Länder.Two years earlier, on 5 May 1955, the FederalRepublic had regained its sovereignty, and theoccupation was ended – though it persisted in the
Soviet-controlled DDR and in divided Berlin. A
treaty had been concluded on 26 May 1952 to
hand back sovereignty. But it was dependent on
a second treaty signed in Paris a day later, pro-viding for a German military contribution toWestern defence; this treaty required ratiﬁcation
by the parliaments of the participating countries
including the French Assembly. What had trans-
formed the situation so dramatically since 1949and what had then delayed the actual consum-mation of a changed relationship with West
Germany? The process was closely related to the
growing tensions of the Cold War as a result of
the Berlin crisis and the Korean War. The costsof West European defence had become so highthat both the French and British came to regard
German help in some form as indispensable. So
far, the armies of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, which had been founded in April
1949 had borne the burden alone. Recognisingthe sensitivity internationally of the question ofGerman rearmament, Adenauer showed no unbe-
coming keenness but suggested that only if hard-
pressed by the Allies would his countrymen
consider a West German contingent within theframework of a European army. In discussingGermany’s possible readiness with the high com-
missioners in August 1950, Adenauer astutely
linked the issue to the recovery of sovereignty.
The Americans urged that it should be taken up.
In October 1950 Prime Minister René Pleven, toallay French fears of a revived Wehrmacht, pro-posed what became known as the Pleven Plan –
a European army with only small German con-
tingents under European command. The ‘Stalin
Note’, 10 March 1952, sought to disrupt theprocess by offering uniﬁcation and a peace treatyto a non-aligned Germany. A spoiling tactic or a
sincere offer? The West rejected the proposals of
a sovereign Germany forced to remain neutral.The procrastination over ratifying the treaty to setup a European Defence Community signed on 27May 1952 and the refusal of the French Assembly
in August 1954 to ratify, delayed acceptance of
the Federal Republic as an equal, but it was only
a delay. The die had been cast. A West Germanarmy was needed by the NATO allies.The path to German sovereignty was complex.A nine-power conference was called in London in
September 1954 consisting of the ﬁve original

European Allies – Britain, France, Belgium,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands (the BrusselsTreaty powers) – together with the NATO alliesItaly, Canada and the US; the Federal Republic
was invited to this conference. It then transferred
to Paris, where a number of interdependent
treaties, the Paris Agreements, were concluded on23 October 1954. In May 1955 the FederalRepublic was integrated into the Western alliances
– the European alliance (to be known as the West
European Union) and NATO. But limits were
placed on West German rearmament, the mostimportant of which was to forbid the manufactureof nuclear weapons. The occupation regime was
ended, except for the Allied rights in Berlin, whose
integrity and survival rested on Allied agreements
made with the Russians in 1945. Adenauer gained
the right for the Federal Republic to speak for allof Germany. The Federal Republic for its partbound itself not to attempt to change its frontiers
nor to attempt to reunify Germany by force. Thus
the Federal Republic made clear that it would act
only in its own defence with its new allies – NATOwas a defensive alliance. This reﬂected Adenauer’sown beliefs. In this respect the foundation for 
the new policy towards West Germany’s Eastern
neighbours in the Chancellor Brandt years of the
1970s was already laid in the 1950s. Finally,
France and the Federal Republic agreed on thenew Saar plebiscite. It was a comprehensive clear-ing up of problems.Schumacher’s opposition was, in part, an opposi-
tion to Adenauer personally and to what he be-
lieved he stood for; the gradual reintroduction tothe leadership of German society of all those who
had served and ﬂourished under Hitler. Schu-

macher wanted to bring about a thoroughgoing1WEST GERMANY509
reform. He was bitterly opposed to communismand ready to see Germany align with the West, andhe too championed West European integration.
But he demanded the full recovery of German sov-

ereignty ﬁrst, the regaining of respect, before the
Federal Republic could, as a free agent, ally withthe West. What he condemned was the kind of bar-
gaining – a West German military contribution as
the price of sovereignty – in which Adenauer was
willing to engage in the spirit of Realpolitik. ButSchumacher’s nationalist tone and his demands for
reuniﬁcation had an air of unreality. His terms, thatthe Germans in the Soviet zone were to be allowedto choose freely and the Russians were to with-

draw, were unacceptable to the Soviet leaders
despite their blandishing of West German opinion
by holding out the prospect of reuniﬁcation pro-
vided Germany remained neutral thereafter. Such acondition was as unacceptable to Schumacher, to
Erich Ollenhauer (who succeeded to the party
leadership after Schumacher’s death in 1952) and
to the majority of the SPD leadership as it was to Adenauer. The SPD was also united in oppos-ing all the practical measures for rearmament
Adenauer had negotiated, on the ground that
West Germany had negotiated from an inferior
position. But on the issue of rearmament itself the
party was deeply divided. As an opposition, with-
out ultimate responsibility for policies, they couldmore easily afford to take their principled stand.Adenauer’s approach to rearmament and sover-
eignty won majority support in the Bundestag.
The former enemy was now accepted as an ally.Adenauer’s closely linked foreign and rearmamentpolicies had also overcome the most bitter division
at home and had resisted the attacks unleashed on
them by the SPD. Among young Germans, who
now faced conscription, there was understandable
opposition; the ‘re-educated’ Germans couldhardly fathom such a turnaround, and then therewere those genuinely convinced by the experiences
of the war that Germans should not bear arms
again. On the right, among ex-soldiers’ organisa-

tions, arose the demand that the besmirched hon-
our of Hitler’s Wehrmacht must ﬁrst be restored.
Schumacher’s arguments in the Bundestag were
powerful: the linking of rearmament with political
concessions to German sovereignty, he thundered,was a cynical bargaining that marked the end ofdemocracy. But Adenauer secured ratification of the Paris treaties by the Bundestag in March
1953. He went on to win the elections in
September. Yet with the failure of the EDC, the
Paris treaties had to be renegotiated. The new Paris Agree-ments (October 1954) now had to be ratiﬁed. Consequently the recovery of German
sovereignty within the Western alliance was post-

poned to 5 May 1955 and conscription to 1956.
During the ﬁerce debates Der Spiegelmagazineironically echoed Goebbels’s ‘Do you want totalwar?’ Popular opposition to nuclear weapons inGermany and remilitarisation remained a rallying
cry in demonstrations until 1969 and revived in 
the 1980s.Adenauer’s foreign and rearmament policiesdid not win universal support, but the acceptanceof their chancellor as a respected equal in the cap-
itals of Western Europe, and even in Moscow in
September 1955, restored the buffeted sense of
German pride. Yet, more than anything, theevident success of Erhard’s economic policies andthe marked improvement in standards of living,
the visible recovery of West Germany with the
rebuilding of its cities, assured Adenauer and the
coalitions he led of seemingly inevitable victories
in elections. The CDU/CSU was further helpedin 1953 by the June risings in Berlin and theSoviet zone, in 1957 by the continuing fear of
Soviet aggression. In both these years, Adenauer
easily won an overall majority. By the next elec-
tion in the summer of 1961, conﬁdence in derAltewas slipping. His dithering reaction to theBerlin Wall crisis and his age (he was now eighty-
ﬁve), combined with his reluctance to step down
to make way for Erhard, the heir apparent, cost
the CDU/CSU its absolute majority. His last two
years in ofﬁce were unhappy. The Cabinet squab-bled; the FDP partners made difﬁculties; then 
the defence minister, the ebullient Franz Josef
Strauss, unwittingly resurrected memories of the
totalitarian past. Der Spiegelhad published anarticle on defence matters in October 1961.Believing that conﬁdential information had beenleaked, Strauss ordered police to search the mag-
azine’s ofﬁces and an editor was arrested; mean-
while Adenauer absurdly referred to Der Spiegel510THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
as ‘a hotbed of treason’. But it all ended with agovernment rout: democracy had passed a test inthe face of arbitrary government. Two years later,
in October 1963, Adenauer at last made way for
Erhard.Adenauer had never doubted the path WestGermany had to follow. Unerringly he anchored
the Federal Republic to the community of
Western European nations and to NATO. He
rejected all Soviet blandishments and hints that a
neutral, disarmed Germany might be reuniﬁed.Was there ever a possibility that West Germanycould have chosen the ‘Austrian’ solution?Adenauer regarded as the centrepiece of hisachievement the Franco-German reconciliation,
and the creation between them of an ‘unarmedfrontier’. The Franco-German friendship treaty ofJanuary 1963 symbolised the special relationship
that had been established between the two coun-
tries. Adenauer did not have to create tension with
the Soviet Union to drive his countrymen into thearms of the Western alliance. The repression offreedoms in the Soviet zone, the harsh Ulbricht
regime in the German Democratic Republic which
led to the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 to
prevent even more millions of Germans leaving
their people’s republic, the periodic Soviet threatsto West Berlin, the preponderance of Soviettroops and tanks, not at a safe distance but just
across the border, their use in East Berlin in 1953
and in Budapest in 1956 were all sufﬁcient to con-
vince the majority that safety lay in close alliancewith Germany’s NATO partners.In the Adenauer period there was little oppor-tunity to improve relations with the Soviet Union
and the DDR. Adenauer’s claim that his govern-ment could speak for all Germans until free elec-tions were held in what was, in Western eyes, stillthe Soviet zone took up the moral high ground,
even if the claim was looking increasingly unreal.
The Federal Republic broke off diplomatic rela-
tions with any country that recognised the sover-eignty of the DDR and exchanged ambassadors(the Hallstein Doctrine). On his visit to Moscow
in 1955, however, Adenauer had to breach this
line and agree to an exchange of ambassadors
with the Soviet Union, as part of a bargain to
release German prisoners of war still languishingin the USSR. The Soviet Union in the post-Stalindecades was realistic too and accepted the Federal
Republic as an independent and powerful nation
whose loyalty to the Western alliance could not
be shaken. Responding immediately to theSchuman Plan, Adenauer had also helped to laythe foundations of the European Economic
Community, accepting that in its relations with
France, Germany would for a time have to show
deference to de Gaulle’s visions of grandeur. Inchanged circumstances, his successors were ableto modify the policies adopted towards the Soviet
Union and the DDR, but in all its essentials
Adenauer had set the fundamental course to be
followed by the Federal Republic in its relations
with its neighbours and the rest of the world. Hepossessed that rare gift of the statesman, theability to distinguish the important from the sec-
ondary, and steadfastly to pursue the main objec-
tives of his policy without being led astray by
subsidiary considerations.In his policies at home Adenauer was less suc-cessful. Autocratic in his Cabinet, he manipulated
colleagues and felt little loyalty towards them. 
His views of the past and present were clear to
the point of cynicism. Above reproach in his own behaviour during the Nazi years, he knewthat the same could not be said of the majority
of his countrymen. But the nation could not
simply discard all former adherents of National
Socialism; who would have been left to run thecountry and to rebuild it? Everyone would needto pull together, whatever their past, except for a
few members of the Nazi elite. There would be
no witch-hunts. The administration that had run1WEST GERMANY511

the country before 1945 ran it again in the 1950s.Owners, managers and workers pulled together toachieve better living standards. The watchword
was Wiedergutmachung, restitution. Pensions tothose who had helped Hitler were honoured;
refugees from the East received capital to startagain; those who had survived the war with prop-erty intact were taxed to pay for this. Jewish
victims received some compensation and, for
those millions who had been murdered during
the war, the new State of Israel received a global
sum which, by 1980, amounted to nearly 3.5billion DM. But despite the large sums paid theycould not match all the looted wealth or com-
pensate for millions of murders – though this was
not the view taken by many Germans at the 
time. Nonetheless, Adenauer persistently backedWiedergutmachung as morally necessary, andessential for the good name of the new Germany.
At the same time he defended the employment of
former high officials of the Nazi state, even
employing in his own ofﬁce Hans Globke, thecivil servant who had helped to draft theNürnberg anti-Semitic laws in 1935. The past was
past and new loyalties were allowed to replace old
ones.To one man in his Cabinet Adenauer owedmore than to any other. Ludwig Erhard, ministerof economic affairs, symbolised the new-foundGerman prosperity: jovial and rotund, he was
never seen in public without a fat cigar. A vote for
the CDU/CSU was as much a vote for Erhard
and his concept of the socially responsible marketeconomy as it was for Adenauer, the father ﬁgure,the ‘helmsman’. How did the economic transfor-
mation come about? Erhard could only provide
the right conditions for workers and management
to create the export-led boom. It was the quality
and reliability of German manufacture, machinetools, products of heavy engineering and cars thatbrought success. It was also the willingness of thetrade union leaders to give up class warfare and for
two decades to restrain wage demands. Abroad
and at home there was an almost insatiable
appetite for capital goods and cars. The cities hadto be rebuilt. The ‘American dream’ propagatedby Hollywood created desires and expectations
that only hard work could fulﬁl. The change for
the better from the low point of 1945 to 1947 was
so dramatic by the mid-1950s that people spoke
of an ‘economic miracle’. Conﬁdence in a betterfuture was rekindled.The statistics in the accompanying tables revealthe steady growth with unemployment falling to
negligible proportions in 1971, though inﬂation
increased from 1 per cent to 5 per cent in the1960s. Unemployment was a particularly sensi-tive issue in Germany. High unemployment in
1932–3 was widely credited with having made
possible the rise of Hitler. Could the democracy
of the Federal Republic survive high unemploy-ment? Progress was not smooth: between 1954and 1958 unemployment reached 7 per cent and
fell no lower than 4 per cent, which alarmed the
electorate; but thereafter from 1973 until the
1990s never exceeded 3 per cent, and for the
period 1961–6 it stayed below 1 per cent. Theshortage of workers was ﬁrst ﬁlled by the steadyinflux of refugees from the Soviet zone of
Germany and then increasingly from the pool of
unemployed in the Mediterranean countries,
especially Italy and Turkey. By 1973 there were2.6 million Gastarbeiter(guestworkers) in theFederal Republic. This availability of labour was
one reason for West Germany’s rapid indus-

establishment of the Common Market in 1958.Management and trade unions were prepared towork together, investment provided up-to-dateproduction methods and German goods gained a
reputation for quality in a widening world market
hungry for goods. The over-valuation of the
German currency during the 1950s and beyond
acted as a spur to efﬁciency and productivity.
Ultimately it was the skill and will of managementand workers that created the ‘miracle’ of recovery
based on export-led growth. The Germans had
come to expect improvements in their standard of
living and low inﬂation; a sound economy wasregarded as the natural state of affairs.By 1963 Erhard no longer received the credit forGermany’s prosperity. The heir apparent had
been kept too long in the wings. Now as federal
chancellor he lacked lustre and soon ran into dif-ﬁculties with his FDP partners and particularlywith the ambitious Franz Josef Strauss. There
were Cabinet squabbles over Erhard’s preference
for America to de Gaulle’s France, over the
support price for grain, which caused a deepFranco-German rift, and over the supply of armsto Israel. The electorate in the 1960s, however,
was more concerned with continuing the eco-
nomic policies that had served them so well and
were not about to entrust government to the
Social Democratic opposition. Despite Erhard’sdeclining prestige, the CDU/CSU won anotherresounding electoral victory in 1965. Just a year
later, the FDP ministers resigned; the economic
climate had worsened temporarily, and between
1965 and 1967 the gross national product grewby less than 2 per cent. Haunted by fears of inﬂa-tion – another trauma of the 1920s the Germans
could not shake off – government expenditurewas cut back and unemployment averaged 3 percent. To German perceptions it appeared as if agrave crisis was at hand. What in fact hadoccurred was no more than a swing in the busi-
ness cycle. As the economy developed the Federal
Republic could not sustain the rates of growth of
earlier years. But Erhard had lost the conﬁdence
of his own party, the CDU, and Strauss and otherleading politicians were ready to ﬁght for the 
succession; in the event, Kurt Georg Kiesinger
emerged as his successor and leader of the
CDU/CSU.The outcome of all the political intrigues andnegotiations was an astonishing one. The FDPbecame the opposition party, and the CDU/CSU
and SPD led by the charismatic former mayor 
of West Berlin, Willy Brandt, formed a Grand
Coalition in December 1966 under Chancellor
Kiesinger, with Brandt as his deputy and foreignminister. The coalition had been possible onlybecause the SPD had formally abandoned its
Marxist doctrines in 1959 at the Gotha party con-
ference. To win the opportunity of becoming the
party of government, the SPD moved to thepolitical centre. Like the CDU, the SPD nowturned itself into an umbrella party appealing to
a wide spectrum, from the socialist left, who had
nowhere else to go, to the liberal centre. This
became its source of electoral strength, but also
brought with it an internal weakness as the leftwing came into conﬂict with its right wing. Theyears of the Grand Coalition also saw a kind of
midlife crisis for the Federal Republic. A new,
young post-war electorate, bored with bourgeois
values and prosperity, made its presence violentlyfelt in 1967. Traditional society in the FederalRepublic and elsewhere in Europe and the US
was on the eve of fundamental changes.1WEST GERMANY513

The post-war history of France is full of contra-dictions. To outward appearances the Fourth
Republic was plagued by a degree of political
instability that promised to repeat the weaknessesand follies of the Third, which had ended withVichy’s disgrace. The individualistic French,
divided on so many issues and by so many parties
and groupings, seemed ill-suited to a parliamen-
tary democracy. De Gaulle certainly believed this
when he withdrew from government in January1946 and then, a little less than a year later in1947, launched his movement grandly called the
Rassemblement du Peuple Français, offering his
leadership above party in place of the squabbling,
weak politicians who by their jostling for powerwere reducing the National Assembly to ridicule.But the constitution of the Fourth Republic had
vested power in the National Assembly rather
than in the president and the executive. De Gaulle
had to wait in the wings for eleven years.The spectacle of twenty-two governmentsfrom December 1946 to May 1958, the shortestlasting four days and the longest a little over a
year, seemed to justify the behaviour of those
groups who treated parliamentary democracy
with scorn. The French Communist Party, whichstill looked to Stalin’s Russia for guidance and wasexcluded from any share in responsible govern-
ment after May 1947, attacked each government
successively, and felt no sense of commitment to
the institutions of the Republic. Its dominationof the trade unions through the communist-ledConfédération Général du Travail (CGT), whosemembership was larger than that of the MRP–
Catholic Union and the Socialist Union (Force
Ouvrière 1947) combined, enabled it to harassthe governments of the Fourth Republic. Dur-ing the years of acute inflation and shortages
(1945–8), when wholesale prices tripled but
wages lagged behind, there was plenty to fuel dis-
content. Split ideologically and frequently calling
strikes that were politically motivated, organisedlabour was limited in the constructive role itcould play to help reform and modernise the
economy. French working people did not feel
that their standard of living had significantly
improved during the twelve years of the FourthRepublic or that disparities of wealth had de-creased. Apart from a short period of comparative
price stability from 1952 to 1955, inﬂation had
become endemic.The difﬁcult conditions of working people’slives help to explain why, despite the Cold War, theFrench Communist Party was able to retain theelectoral support of one in every four voters,
polling the largest percentage of the votes in every
election from November 1946 to January 1956.
But its split with the fiercely anti-communistsocialists deprived the left of a commanding parlia-
mentary role. Support for the socialists was not as
strong as that for the communists and fell away
from the end-of-war peak of 23 per cent to 15 per
cent in 1956. The Fourth Republic was also threat-
ened by the re-emergence and recovery of the rightChapter 47THE FRENCH FOURTH REPUBLICECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICALINSTABILITY
and by the tactics of de Gaulle, who had re-enteredactive politics in 1947. Those on the right, discon-
tented with the workings of the Fourth Republic,
from de Gaulle’s Rassemblement to various con-

servative groupings, polled 26 per cent in 1951,
and later with the popular Poujadists in the 1956elections gained 32 per cent. Thus coalition gov-
ernments were threatened by the prospect of dis-

agreement among the partners.If we add to this political instability the con-servative structure of the greater part of French
industry, dominated by small enterprises andwidely dispersed – in 1956 there were still499,000 industrial plants, each employing an
average of eleven workers – a backward agricul-
ture, much of it split into uneconomic small
farms, as well as a much higher rate of inﬂationthan that of its industrial rivals, the total pictureis bleak.Armed resistance to the threatened loss ofempire after 1945 greatly increased France’s
burdens in the ﬁrst difﬁcult post-war decade. DeGaulle was not the ﬁrst French leader to attemptto compensate for the humiliation of defeat by
reasserting France’s grandeur overseas. Even the
French communist leader Maurice Thorez sup-
ported the French army against the communist
Vietnamese independence movement, declaringthat he ‘did not intend to liquidate the Frenchposition in Indo-China’. Their unsuccessful war
in Indo-China, from its start in December 1946
until the armistice agreed in Geneva in July 1954,
debilitated the French, costing them more thanthey had received in Marshall Aid; 10 per cent ofthe national budget had been swallowed up by it
and 75,000 ofﬁcers and men had lost their lives.
Meanwhile, in North Africa, the French were
facing serious conﬂict in their protectorates of
Tunisia and Morocco. Here, too, they hadrefused to bow to nationalist demands until ter-rorism and resistance wore down their will to
maintain their rule. Independence was granted to
Morocco and Tunisia in 1956. The withdrawals
from these two North African countries hadanother cause. A French presence there wasregarded as secondary to continued French rule
in Algeria: for Algeria was not a protectorate, it
was ‘France’. The savage conﬂict, which began in1954 and was to last for eight years, ﬁnally brokethe Fourth Republic and brought back de Gaulle.In the summer of 1958 France came close to civil
strife and the politicians, in despair, gave way to
de Gaulle’s Fifth Republic.This catalogue of disasters and burdens is,however, only one side of the history of the
Fourth Republic. Behind the unstable political
façade, the Fourth Republic inaugurated an
industrial revolution by a remarkable combination
of state encouragement, central planning andprivate enterprise. From 1944 to 1947 the statehad acquired considerable economic power,
having brought into public ownership and
control the Renault motor works, Air France, the
Bank of France and the larger private banks,insurance, gas, electricity and the coal-miningindustry. Although the departure of the commu-
nists from government and the decline of the
socialists halted the expansion of state ownership,
there was no denationalisation, and what hadbeen nationalised was vigorously developed. Theresults of the modernisation of agriculture were
patchy and less spectacular; nevertheless over a
decade and a half some real progress was
achieved. The new concept of modernisation was
typiﬁed by Jean Monnet, one of France’s mostdistinguished public servants.Monnet had persuaded de Gaulle after the warto allow him to organise a group of experts to
prepare a plan for the recovery and modernisation
of France. The ﬁrst Five-Year Plan was approvedin January 1947. It placed Monnet at the head ofa small secretariat in the modest ofﬁces of the
Commissariat du Plan de Modernisation et
d’Équipment, charged with promoting the reali-
sation of its objectives. The Plan indicated growth
targets for speciﬁc sectors of the economy; mod-ernisation commissions were set up for eachsector at which the details of how this growth
could be achieved were worked out with indus-
trialists, civil servants and the unions, with the
assistance of members of Monnet’s secretariat.Monnet’s Plan bears little resemblance to Sovietfive-year plans, with their detailed targets and
directives. In place of the stiﬂing bureaucracy and
rigid, inefﬁcient central planning of the USSR,1THE FRENCH FOURTH REPUBLIC515
cajolery, incentives and more subtle means of per-suasion were employed. This method of proceed-ing was greatly aided by a closely knit French
establishment.A peculiarity of the French establishment wasthe interrelationship of government, regionaladministration, senior civil servants, politicians,industrial management and higher education. 
The French leadership was recruited from 
elitist educational establishments. Young men
would be selected on academic merit for entry to
the École Polytechnique or the École Nationaled’Administration, and then recruited into one ofthe Grands Corps, where the career ladder
reaches to the top posts in the ministries or the
prefectoral administration. This elitist group of
graduates also runs the state industries and is tobe found in the private sector too. The close old-boy network gets things done and counterbal-
ances the rigid administrative divisions of the
state. The expertise developed by groups of bril-
liant technocrats in engineering, in administrationand in business skills, together with their dedica-tion to the state, which rewarded them hand-
somely with high salaries, created a powerful elite
that, in the unstable political conditions of the
Fourth Republic, spearheaded the drive for 
modernisation in industry and agriculture.Such a high degree of institutionalised elitismhas its weaknesses and its dangers too. It is fun-
damentally undemocratic. It is possible for those
of poor background through sheer talent to enter
one of the Écoles, but it is very much easier forthe children of the better-off Parisian families who can afford the best education in preparation 
for the competitive entrance examinations. Of
course, France is not unique in this respect. The
system tends to stiﬂe talent and initiative lower
down; it also encourages patronage and allowsexcessive inﬂuence to a small number. On theother hand, it has provided France with an able
corps of innovators and administrators in key
positions, and so counteracted the disruptive
political and industrial conﬂicts that plagued theFourth Republic.Monnet’s First Plan (1947–1952/4) concen-trated on key sectors fundamental to a general
modernisation programme: coal, electricity, steel,cement, the mechanisation of agriculture, fertilis-ers and transportation. But the most immediateneeds of the workers for better housing and con-
sumer goods were largely sacrificed, with the
exception of food, to provide for a better future.
Nor were ﬁnancial controls exerted, so the cur-rency rapidly lost value which, in turn, createdindustrial instability for most of the years of the
Fourth Republic. All efforts were directed to
improving the productivity of industry and agri-
culture. The result was not an overall advance
across the board, but the creation of somemodern, efﬁcient and technologically progressiveindustries and farms alongside the small, back-
ward nineteenth-century enterprises and peasant
holdings. It was too much to expect the First and
Second Plans (1947–57) to transform the wholeFrench economy; much of agriculture remainedbackward and traditional attitudes prevailed
throughout France. Indeed, the difﬁculties facing
modernisers in France were great. There was no
large increase in the labour force, as there was inWest Germany. The waging of colonial wars, aninefﬁcient system of indirect taxation and high
inﬂation were all serious handicaps. But during
these hard times, which largely contributed to the
return of de Gaulle in 1958, the foundations were
laid for the expansion of the 1960s and later. Themodernising of key sectors enabled France tocompete successfully with West Germany. They
also provided 2 million more jobs, compared with
before the war, and productivity significantly
increased. From 1947 until the early 1960s, suc-cessive plans had an important inﬂuence. As theybecame more sophisticated after 1966 so French
administrations also became less interventionist.
Plans had to be ‘adapted’ in any case to reﬂect
economic realities such as the unexpected oil
shocks of the 1970s.But for the majority of French workers andsmall farmers the gradual transformation of
France, with islands of highly advanced technol-
ogy, did not mean rising standards of living in
accordance with their expectations. France con-tinued to be a divided society of great inequali-ties between the rich and the poor, between the
privileged technocrats of the École Polytechnique
and small businessmen and traditional peasant516THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
farmers who vented their frustrations in support-ing populist movements.It was a curious paradox of the Fourth Republicthat so much solid progress in changing the fun-
damental economic and industrial structure of
France could be taking place in parallel with the
political and social strife reminiscent of the 1930sand the Third Republic. Proportional representa-tion and the French electoral system permitted a
multiplicity of parties. The so-called ‘Third
Force’, standing between Gaullism and commu-
nism, played musical chairs in successive govern-
ment coalitions, the exclusion of communists andGaullists from government being the one point ofagreement among the other parties from left to
right. From 1947 to 1951 coalitions were built
around three parties; the Mouvement Républicain
Populaire (MRP), the Socialists and the Radicals.At the election of 1951, the Conservatives andGaullists increased their strength and the MRPwas weakened, but the Socialists decided to leavethe government and return to opposition in a bidto rebuild their support. From 1951 to 1954 gov-
ernments were based on centre–right coalitions.
From 1954 to 1958 the Socialists once more
returned to government in coalitions with thecentre. On specific policy issues the coalitionparties held strongly opposing views, and there
were endless rounds of compromise, accommo-
dation, rupture, and back to compromise.The MRP, that is to say the French ChristianDemocrats, managed to remain partners in allthese coalition governments. It was not a narrowly
Catholic party, though it reconciled its majority of
Catholic supporters to the Republic. It inclined to
the Conservatives in believing in a market econ-
omy and private property, but was progressive inseeking to overcome traditional industrial conﬂictby collaboration between employer and employee.
On issues of social and welfare policies it sided
with the Socialists, but differed from them and the
Radicals in seeking to retain independent Catholiceducation with state aid. But on policies relatingto Western European cooperation, generally fa-
voured by the MRP and the Socialists, they were
aligned against the conservative right. The parties
in the National Assembly were prepared to make
compromises only on a short-term basis. Theinstability that so discredited the Fourth Republicwas an inevitable outcome. Nonetheless, there was
greater continuity than might at ﬁrst be supposed,
since a number of able ministers, for instance the
Socialist Jules Moch, was appointed to several of1THE FRENCH FOURTH REPUBLIC517

the governments. The Foreign Ministry remainedfrom 1944 to 1954 in the hands of the MRP,alternately in the charge of Georges Bidault and
Robert Schuman.Against the disasters of the colonial wars haveto be set the success of the Fourth Republic’sWest European policies, and the conciliation andpractical cooperation of France and the Benelux
countries with their former enemies, the Federal
Republic of Germany and Italy. During the years
of the Fourth Republic, the Christian Social
Democratic leaders of West Germany, Italy andFrance, Adenauer, de Gasperi and Schuman, laidthe foundations for the new economic and polit-
ical relations of the principal Western Europe
nations, which proved so powerful a force in pro-
moting their mutual economic growth and pros-perity, and settled their historic and territorialenmities.The French recognised that the imbalance inEurope had only been temporarily solved by
Germany’s defeat. German vitality would lead, sothe French feared, to a resurgence of power and arenewed threat of aggression. De Gaulle at ﬁrst
followed past traditions in maintaining the
‘French thesis’ that even after the East–West divi-
sion of Germany, West Germany would need to
be curbed further and permanently. In the widerEuropean context he saw the continued need foran Eastern link with Russia. In the treatment of
occupied Germany the French stubbornly resisted
the Anglo-American efforts to bring the Western
occupation zones together and to centralise their administration. What is more, the Frenchdemanded the economic detachment of the Ruhr
and the Saar from West Germany, and some form
of internationalisation of the industrial Ruhr. The
Cold War, and the resulting American and British
military presence on the continent of Europe,shattered de Gaulle’s vision, shared for a time bymany French ministers after his withdrawal in
1946, that France could be the dominant conti-
nental West European state, acting as arbiter
between East and West. Instead, the French riskedtotal isolation. They therefore went along withAnglo-American plans put forward at the London
Conference in 1948 on the future of Germany. A
West German state would be created with a fed-eral constitution; safeguards would remain, espe-cially Allied supervision of heavy industry, coal,iron and steel in the industrial Ruhr complex. But
the US and Britain, for whom the occupation was
proving a costly strain, were determined to help
West Germany to recover economically and to sta-bilise it politically and socially. With the continuedthreat from the Soviet Union, a chaotic and dis-
satisﬁed West Germany could be dangerous. The
French accepted the need for change.In September 1949 the federal West Germanstate came into being, its government, however,still subject to some Allied supervision and con-trols. The occupation of the French zone came to
an end. France would have to ﬁnd a new way of
living with its powerful neighbour.France’s foreign policy adjusted to thechanged international conditions of the Cold Warand the revival of West Germany with difﬁculty
and only after fierce debates in the National
Assembly, which had to ratify the treaties
embodying the shift in France’s position. In 1949France agreed to become a founding member ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, but the
spectre of Germany was what most concerned 
the French. Would Germany be built up militar-
ily by the Americans and also become a member
of NATO, eventually overshadowing France?Despite Schuman’s robust rejection of such a pos-sibility ‘even in the future’, and his insistence that
Germany would remain disarmed, others saw the
writing on the wall. The debates in the National
Assembly show how far France was from recon-ciliation with Germany.There was also another current at work, thecall for a federation of Europe – a cause strongly
espoused by Winston Churchill. The ideal of a
united Europe was appealing, especially to a
younger generation seeking an escape from therecent past. The high point of the Europeanmovement was reached at The Hague Congress
in May 1948, but practical results were few.In May 1949 ten West European governmentsagreed to set up the Council of Europe, thepurpose of which was to achieve a greater unitybetween its members. There was to be no pooling
of sovereignty, however. The Council’s work was
largely conﬁned in the 1950s to cultural spheres.518THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
The signature of a Convention of Human Rightsin 1950 was nevertheless a notable and lastingachievement. The European movement had come
to a dead end by then, as far as the political inte-
gration of Western Europe was concerned.
Neither France nor Britain, nor any of the othermembers, was ready for a real United States ofEurope. But the public support generated for the
idea of Europe played a part in preparing the way
for the more hard-headed approach of piecemeal
economic integration followed in the 1950s.For France the fundamental problem of theoverwhelming strength of Germany, even adivided Germany, remained to be faced. The out-

break of the Korean War and the likely continua-

tion of the Cold War made it obvious that the
Americans and the British would insist on WestGerman recovery. Wartime policies pursuing thedemilitarisation and industrial dismantling of West
Germany were ended, and the French came under
great pressure from Washington to permit West
German rearmament and a German contributionto defence. France had to make the best of it: itcould not be defended without the alliance of
Britain and the US. The French prime minister,
René Pleven, therefore took the initiative in
October 1950 to call for a European army subject
to a European Defence Community (EDC), whichwould avoid the danger of creating a separate WestGerman army. Under the Pleven Plan, German
combat units would be kept small and thus inca-

pable of independent action. In May 1952 the
Occupation Statute was repealed and the FederalRepublic of Germany took a further step towardsthe restoration of full sovereignty; simultaneously
the European Defence Community Treaty was
concluded between France, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries
(Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg).Britain was not a member. The Anglo-Saxon separation from continental Europe had, from the
ﬁrst, worried the French as they faced a resurgent
Germany, for memories of Britain’s lack of support
in the inter-war years were still fresh. To reassurethe French, the British Conservative governmentconcluded a mutual defence treaty with the EDC.
The French had, however, to concede that the
national army units would be 12,000–13,000 menstrong, rather than the 1,000–2,000 they hadenvisaged, and that West Germany would con-
tribute half a million men.The signature of the treaty was not enough tosecure its adoption. It had to be ratiﬁed by the
signatories’ national parliaments as well, includ-ing the French National Assembly. No issue sincethe Dreyfus case divided France more deeply than
the EDC and its consequential endorsement of
German rearmament. Successive French govern-
ments, uncertain of ratification, procrastinated
until in August 1954 the National Assembly,when the treaty was ﬁnally submitted, rejected it.The opponents of EDC initially refused to see
that France could not veto the creation of a new
German army in the long run since the other
West European nations and the US were insistingthat the Federal Republic be accepted as a fullally. By December of the same year, enough
members of the National Assembly had shifted
their views for the restoration of sovereignty to
the Federal Republic and its membership ofNATO to be accepted. Policy had thus run fullcircle, from Pleven’s attempt to create a European
army that would have avoided a new German
national force, to an acceptance of German rear-
mament and the creation of the Bundeswehr.
Pleven’s plan to counterbalance German strengthby playing the card of ‘European integration’ hadbeen aborted at the military level.German industrial power had been closelylinked with German aggression – for example, the
alliance of the Krupps with the Hohenzollernsbefore 1914 and with Hitler after 1933. Europeanintegration could break these links. Accordingly
the French developed dynamic European policies
that were to change the economic and political
face of Western Europe. But what form should
European integration take? By 1950 it was clearthat the hopes for a ‘federalist’ solution to create aUnited States of Europe, by which a member
state’s interests would be subordinated to a federal
European government, were not going to be
realised. The Council of Europe could not bedeveloped further along integrationist lines, butthere was another way. Prussia’s Zollvereinin thenineteenth century had shown how common
economic interests could bind states together; the1THE FRENCH FOURTH REPUBLIC519
way to proceed was not at the top, at nationallevel, but rather ‘functionally’, where collabora-tion could be shown to beneﬁt all concerned.
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had
shown the way. During the war they had agreed to
form a customs union, which came into operationin 1948. The Belgian statesman, Paul HenriSpaak, was an ardent Europeanist; he had been
elected to the presidency of the Council of Europe
and was later to play an important role in the cre-
ation of the Common Market.The Americans also sought to further WestEuropean integration. Marshall Aid had beenoffered on condition that the Europeans them-
selves should cooperate and work out a coordi-
nated plan for reconstruction. This led to the
setting up of the Organisation for EuropeanEconomic Co-operation (OEEC) in April 1948.The carrot of US aid spurred sixteen Western
European nations (in October 1949 the Federal
Republic of Germany joined and, also in 1949,
Spain) to agree on how to share the aid. TheCouncil of the OEEC was composed of repre-sentatives of the member states, but it could not
impose its decisions on individual nations. It was
not a supranational body, but its expert commit-
tees developed the practice of discussing eco-
nomic cooperation. Their most important anddifficult task was to agree on the division ofdollars, which the US was making available.European integration policies became, as far astheir leading proponents were concerned, a ques-

tion not just of idealism but also of hard-headedrealism. For the French a comprehensive arrange-
ment with the German iron, coal and steel com-

plexes made good economic sense in safe-guarding
French heavy industry; at the same time suprana-

tional control would remove any possibility of
undetected or uncontrolled German rearmament.French determination to secure access to the coalmines of the Saar, without the bad blood a separa-

tion of the Saar from West Germany would cause,
was an additional incentive. The outcome of all
these considerations was the famous plan proposedin May 1950 by the foreign minister, RobertSchuman.The Schuman Plan, largely Jean Monnet’sbrain-child, put forward the bold scheme ofpooling French and German production of coal,iron and steel – it would be open to other WestEuropean countries to join if they wished. A
crucial aspect of the Plan was the setting up of a
supranational ‘high authority’ that would make
decisions not on a national level, but in the overallinterests of the integrated industries. Adenauersaw the advantages of the Plan and promptly
accepted it. West Germany would be treated as
an equal, and the European solution allowed rela-
tionships of trust to be re-established that would
facilitate the recovery of full sovereignty for theFederal Republic. This was ﬁnally attained onlyﬁve years later in May 1955.The European Coal and Steel Communityplayed the key role in taking its six West Euro-
pean member states (France, West Germany, Italyand the Benelux countries) forward at last alongthe road of economic and political coordination.
By this means the ‘German problem’ became
manageable, and, more than that, West European
economic cooperation made all of the participat-ing states rapidly more prosperous. The success ofthe original ECSC was due, in the ﬁrst place, to
the fact that its aims were strictly limited.As with the Monnet Plan for French mod-ernisation, a practical start had been made in just
one crucial sector of industry; the creation fromthe start of a comprehensive European politicaland economic union was recognised as impossi-
ble. Second, institutions were created which
down-graded national sovereignty – an important
reason why Britain would not join – and trans-ferred decision-making to the supranational HighAuthority. Working with it were a Council of
Ministers, a Common Assembly and a Court of
Justice. Thus an embryonic European executive,
Parliament and Court were set up, which worked
with government representatives in the Councilof Ministers – but most decisions did not requirethe separate consent of national governments.
Jean Monnet was the choice for the ﬁrst president
of the ECSC.The ECSC overcame an early period of difﬁ-culty and haggling between rival national intereststo prove in the mid-1950s the beneﬁt to all the
participants of having established a common mar-
ket in coal and steel. Business interests in France520THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
and Germany, and the other four countries, nowadvocated extending the common market in coaland steel to the rest of their economies.Thus pressure was building up in a realistic wayfor more ambitious integration. This is not to
underrate the continued enthusiasm for the ideaof ‘Europe’. The European Movement, foundedat The Hague in 1948, was still active and had
won important adherents in the political world of
the six nations. ‘Europe’ offered a road forward
and away from the guilt-ridden past, especially 
for a new generation of young Germans; it alsooffered the best means of reconciliation after two destructive world wars. The foundation of
such reconciliation rested on the new rela-
tionship developing between France and West
Germany, carried forward by many political andsocial groups in both countries. Meetings organ-ised between politicians, journalists, educators,
Chambers of Commerce, town partnerships, cul-
tural exchanges, school exchanges and textbook
revisions to remove national bias are just someexamples of this multifaceted effort to bringabout a fundamental change of attitudes. It
worked because it reﬂected a massive desire for
change by millions of ordinary people.The ideas – inculcated through propagandaand schooling – that national patriotism auto-matically involves hostility to a neighbour, thatnational frontiers should be fought over so that
one country may expand its territory at the
expense of another, and that enmities between
nations were a law of nature, have all vanished inWestern Europe. A perceived common threat,from the Soviet Union, also led to alliances and
military cooperation. But the collaboration of
Western Europe encompasses more than the kind
of alliances that have been formed for common
purposes throughout modern history. That sucha fundamental change in national relations can bebrought about in a region of the world that was
torn with strife is a momentous achievement in
the history of the twentieth century.The three Benelux foreign ministers – theDutchman Johan Beyen, the Belgian Paul HenriSpaak and Joseph Bech of Luxembourg – took
the initiative in the spring of 1955 at govern-
mental level to provide new momentum forEuropean integration: an example of statesmen ofsmall nations who have exerted a disproportion-ate inﬂuence. Their proposal for a large extension
of economic collaboration received the backing of
the European Coal and Steel Community. The
failure of military integration after the Frenchrejection of the European Defence Communitythe previous year had been seen as a setback but
not as an end to integration in other spheres. In
May and June 1955 the foreign ministers of the
Six met in Messina, Sicily. Their agreements
paved the way for further intergovernmental con-ferences and negotiations which took placeduring the following two years. Britain was not
excluded, but its cooperation was half-hearted
and it withdrew without making a serious effort
to overcome the problems of its association. TheSix had difﬁcult problems to iron out and did notwish to be impeded by Britain, though they were
able to resolve their differences far more speed-
ily than the British had expected. They signed 
the treaty setting up the European EconomicCommunity (and Euratom) in Rome in March1957; these treaties were ratiﬁed in the succeed-
ing months of that year. The majority of the
French Assembly in July voted for European 
collaboration and thus dispelled the fears that 
the spectre of defeat aroused by the EDC fail-ure would be repeated. That same month, theBundesrat in West Germany completed the pro-
cess of German ratiﬁcation. The treaties entered
into force on 1 January 1958.All the members of the European EconomicCommunity had had to make concessions andcompromises. Obstacles to trade between the Six
were to be removed eventually. Those of most
immediate importance were the duties levied on
industrial goods in order to protect the importing
country’s home industry. The French and Italiansespecially feared competition from the more efﬁ-cient West Germans. A transitional period of
twelve to fifteen years was therefore agreed,
though in the event the abolition of duties was
speeded up and completed by July 1968. Freetrade required many other aspects of economicmanagement to be harmonised as well, and com-
plex arrangements were agreed over the years: 
for example, common rules of competition, free1THE FRENCH FOURTH REPUBLIC521
movement of workers, of capital and of services,harmonisation of taxation and of quality stan-
dards, and a system of managing currency
exchange rates. An essential feature of the EEC,
beyond the removal of internal barriers of trade
between the Six, was the erection of a commontariff, which non-member states had to pay whenexporting industrial and agricultural goods to the
Common Market. This provided protection where
it was most needed by the Six. Together with pay-
ments from its members it provided the funds of
the common budget of the EEC that could beused to support economic and educational activi-ties within the Six and to pay for the administra-
tion of the Common Market. But it also led to
much tension with the US, whose agricultural
exports particularly were discriminated against.The most controversial aspect of the Com-munity has proved to be the support given to
farmers by the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP). Intervention prices are ﬁxed annually by
the Council of Ministers for each kind of agricul-tural produce and the farmers are guaranteedthese prices. What they cannot sell in the
Common Market, that is the surpluses, are
bought by the Community; exports to non-
Community members are subsidised so that the
farmer secures the intervention price. The farmcosts are met by the EEC budget, which has hadto devote to them the greater part of its funds.
The CAP beneﬁts the countries with most farmers
– France, Eire and Denmark – and is unfavourable
to countries such as Britain, a member since1973, which import food, because world pricesfrequently are below those ﬁxed by the Common
Market to support its farmers. If not corrected by
other mechanisms, this would result in Britain
and Germany paying disproportionate contribu-
tions to the common budget. A second undesir-able feature is the high prices that have to be paidby the consumers of the member countries, and
the stimulus to agricultural production that was
to lead to costly cereal, meat and butter moun-
tains maintained by the EEC as it bought up whatcould not be sold at the set prices. The fundsrequired by the CAP became larger as each year
passed, but member governments found it difﬁ-
cult to deny their farmers, who form an import-ant political constituency. Not until the later1980s was any serious reform attempted. Thesubsidies were devastatingly harmful to Third
World farmers denied cheaper exports.As France braced itself for the full impact ofGerman industrial competition in its markets, itspoliticians could boast that they had secured ben-efits for the large agricultural sector. But the
Common Market proved an immediate success,
greatly surpassing the hopes of those who had
negotiated its establishment. French industry was
stimulated by competition and by the new exportopportunities. Industrial production between1958 and 1962, far from declining, grew by
almost a quarter; the West Germans did even
better, increasing industrial production by more
than a third. West Germany’s and France’s tradewith the rest of the Six doubled and tradebetween France and West Germany tripled in the
same period. The continued economic success of
the Common Market won it the support of the
peoples of the Six as they gained in prosperityfrom economic collaboration, but hopes that itwould lead to closer political union were frus-
trated, especially after the return of General de
Gaulle in 1958.The Commission is the body that runs theEEC, two commissioners being appointed byeach of the member states. In practice, on import-ant issues it can only put forward plans and pro-
posals. Decisions are reached by the Council of
Ministers, which represents the viewpoints of
national governments. Here again, escape clausesallow individual countries to opt out of joint deci-sions if they believe their vital interests to be
affected; what is more, it later turned out that
individual countries could exercise a veto. Even
so, the degree of integration actually achieved
went much further than Britain and its EuropeanFree Trade Area partners were at that time willingto accept. The European Parliament of the Six
was also given only limited supervisory powers.
The most important controlling body to emerge
was, therefore, the Council of Ministers. That hasremained the case to the present day.Two of the most important achievements of theFourth Republic were the French contribution to522THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
the creation of the European Common Marketand Franco-German reconciliation. Yet, littlemore than a year after the signature of the Treaty
of Rome, the Fourth Republic came to an igno-
minious end as General de Gaulle returned to
power on his own terms. The general had no timefor Monnet’s visions of supranationalism. TheEuropean institutions were not to be permitted
to override national decision-making; they were,
in de Gaulle’s view, to act as no more than forums
where national differences could be discussed and
negotiated.By 1958 the majority of French people per-ceived that the rivalries of the political parties in
the National Assembly had made active govern-
ment on many of the crucial problems facing
France virtually impossible. The achievements –the Common Market, reconciliation with WestGermany, security through NATO – were easilyoverlooked as their beneﬁts became apparent onlylater. It was de Gaulle who was to be creditedwith the rising prosperity and modernisation of
France. High inﬂation from 1947 to 1951, when
retail prices more than doubled, followed by three
years of greater stability (1953 to 1955) and aresumption of inﬂation proved very unsettling,even though wages and salaries kept abreast. The
harsh economic measures introduced in the
autumn of 1957, higher taxes and devaluation to
reduce inﬂation, once again hit the pockets of
French families. Constant strikes, some for themost trivial reasons, were one symptom of the dis-content and general malaise. But the ﬁnal blow
was the government’s inability to deal with the
crisis in Algeria, where a military takeover raised
a near panic in Paris at the prospect that the whole country might fall victim to a militarydictatorship.1THE FRENCH FOURTH REPUBLIC523
The defence of its empire in Indo-China andNorth Africa proved a crushing burden for post-
war France. The fall of Dien Bien Phu in May
1954 brought down another French government,but the new prime minister, Pierre Mendès-France, was a politician in a different mould. He
was, like Leon Blum, a Jew, tough, intellectual
and at last ready to face realities – at least some of
the realities. He fulﬁlled his undertaking to bring
France out of the disastrous dirty war in Indo-China in July 1954 by agreeing to the peace termsof the Geneva Conference, and he negotiated
Tunisian autonomy, but, ostensibly over weakness
in dealing with North Africa, he was brought
down in February 1955. The determination of theGaullist right to maintain France’s colonial ruleled to more falls of government until, in 1956,
independence was conceded to both Tunisia and
Morocco. But Algeria was different. Politicians of
all parties – communists, socialists and conserva-
tives – regarded Algeria, governed through theFrench Ministry of the Interior, as part of France.One million French settlers, the pieds noirs, fromthe wealthy to the hard-working ﬁsherman or car-
penter, who had lived in Algeria for a generation
or more, saw themselves as the French of Algeria,not as French men and women living in a colonyof France. All the French political leaders echoed
Mendès-France when he declared, ‘France with-
out Algeria would be no France.’Yet all the talk about Algeria being a part ofFrance was paradoxical and hypocritical, as wasthe rhetoric in the constitution of the FourthRepublic, whose preamble promised equality
without distinction of race or religion. Racism
was as rampant in Algeria as it was in the worstof European colonies overseas. How couldAlgeria be France if the majority of its inhabi-
tants, the 9 million Muslim Arabs, were not
French people with equal rights? There was no
place for the Algerian in the higher administra-
tion of the country; the economy was dominatedby the wealthy European settlers; the plight of theland-hungry poor Muslim Algerian was aggra-

vated by a high birth rate; meanwhile, the larger,
more mechanised settler farms no longer required
large numbers of peasant labourers. The FourthRepublic instituted some reforms but, on the keyissue of political rights, only a measure of osten-
sible power-sharing was introduced. An Algerian-
elected assembly was created, chosen by two
electoral colleges, one composed of the European
French citizens, plus a few meritorious Muslims,some 500,000 electors, who chose sixty membersof the Assembly; the rest of the Muslim popula-
tion chose the other sixty members. Even this was
not enough for the European settlers: electoral
corruption made doubly sure that the Europeanminority would continue its domination.The tragedy of Algeria was that violence andatrocities, involving great loss of innocent lives,
marked the path to nationhood. That was not
how the majority of moderate Muslims wished toachieve their rights. A lack of vision and of gen-Chapter 48THE WAR OF ALGERIAN INDEPENDENCE
THE FIFTH REPUBLIC AND THE RETURN OF DE GAULLEerosity and the resolution of the pieds noirs, actu-ated by fear and material self-interest, to deny theMuslim Algerians genuinely equal rights and self-
determination left the outcome of the struggle to
be decided by the extremists. The settlers believed
that their power, backed by the army of allFrance, could always overwhelm such guerrillaunits as the FLN (Front de Libération Nationale)
could muster. But their conﬁdence misled them.
In the end, the French were sickened by the
bloody excesses and the slaughter of civilians,
which spilled over into metropolitan France. TheFrench military too reacted by torturing capturedFLN to elicit intelligence information. It was a
struggle without honour on both sides. The
majority that ultimately counted was not that of
the pieds noirsin Algeria, but the majority ofvoters in France. To them the price of retainingAlgeria and defending the European settlers
proved too high. De Gaulle ended the Algerian
conﬂict on the only terms that could be secured:
those demanded by the FLN leadership.The twisted road from the close of the SecondWorld War to Algerian independence in 1962 was
punctuated by waves of violence, abortive nego-
tiations and constitutional crises. The liberation
of Europe in May 1945 had raised the expecta-
tion of colonial peoples that a new era haddawned for them. In Sétif, a small Algerianmarket town, these expectations led to a bloody
clash, the ﬁrst of many. Extremist Muslims carry-
ing nationalist ﬂags turned on European settlers
that May, murdering and raping more than ahundred. The French response was to ‘pacify’ theregion in typical colonial fashion, killing thou-
sands of Muslims. The indelible impression of
racist conﬂict and bloodshed overshadowed all
political speeches. De Gaulle had promised a new
deal to the French colonial peoples: they wouldbe led eventuallyto self-government, but the timeand manner would be decided by the French.
Thus the initial stance of the Europeans was that
violence would not wrest that decision of
decolonisation from them. French military powerwas so overwhelming that proposals put forwardby the more moderate Algerian nationalist
leaders, such as Ferhat Abbas, for a compromise
solution were not entertained (Abbas had pro-posed an independent Algeria federated toFrance). The movement for independence, there-fore, became more radical, and new leaders, such
as Ahmed Ben Bella and Belkacem Krim, were
ready to use violence. With just a few hundred
armed men, Belkacem Krim started an openrevolt on 1 November 1954. Throughout thecountry a proclamation was distributed addressed
‘To the Algerian people’ and announcing the for-
mation of the Front de Libération Nationale,
whose objective was to gain Algerian independ-
ence.But the FLN also promised that French set-tlers and French interests would be dealt with
fairly: the pieds noirscould even opt for Algeriannationality. For more than seven years the FLN
fought, without deviating from their objectives.But the implacable hostility of the settlers madeit impossible for any agreement to be reached
which might have safeguarded their future. In
1954 the Fourth Republic rejected as unthinkable
the very idea of Algerian independence. Theprime minister at that time, Pierre Mendès-France, and his socialist minister of the interior,
François Mitterrand, were ready to abandon colo-
nialism in Indo-China, Morocco and Tunisia, but
not in Algeria – for, as they repeatedly pro-

claimed, ‘Algeria is France.’ Their solution wasmilitary repression, which was to be combinedwith economic reform to reduce unemployment.
But reform had no chance. The FLN answered
repression with terrorism.Ten years after Sétif, in August 1955, indis-criminate terrorism was repeated at Philippeville.The murder of Europeans and their Muslim allies
by an FLN-instigated mob led in turn to the
killing of more than a thousand Muslims in
reprisals. Such violence could only play into the
hands of the FLN, who regarded as their enemy,not only France, but those moderate Muslimswho were prepared to accept French rule. The
FLN killings were directed as much against these
‘traitorous’ Muslims as against the French.
Indeed the Muslim Algerians who had placedtheir trust in France were to become the mosttragic victims of the war. The FLN resorted to
bombing cafés and dance halls in Algeria, causing
bloodshed wherever Europeans came together in1THE WAR OF ALGERIAN INDEPENDENCE525
large numbers. The French army responded withequal ferocity, torturing FLN suspects to gaininformation. French military power, however,
could not crush the terrorists. All that could be
achieved were temporary victories over the FLN,
as in what became known as the battle of Algiers.Meanwhile, the pieds noirsbecame suspiciousof the intentions of the government in Paris.
Would they negotiate with the FLN above their
heads? The FLN was gaining respectability inter-
nationally at the United Nations, receiving
support from Tunisia, while Nasser’s Egypt –recently victorious over the French – broadcastpro-Algerian propaganda from Cairo. Practical
help, however, was not so readily forthcoming.In the spring of 1958 the paths of the Euro-pean settlers and the recalcitrant generals inAlgiers, on the one hand, and the politicians ofthe Fourth Republic, on the other, fatefully
crossed. From 15 April until 13 May 1958 Paris
was politically paralysed: no government could be
formed. The way was opened for the return of deGaulle at the end of May. This spelt the collapseof the Fourth Republic and, after another four
years of confusing politics, military repression and
bloodshed, of French Algeria as well.De Gaulle, in 1947, had miscalculated and asa result of his resignation spent a long decade inthe political wilderness, preparing for his return.He wished to end the Fourth Republic and what
he regarded as its fatally flawed parliamentary
constitution, which he believed had brought back
the errors of the Third Republic. But he wouldnot seize power unconstitutionally. The FourthRepublic must turn to him and ask him to save
France from chaos. This did not mean that he was
reluctant to exploit the feelings of those groups
of Frenchmen in France and Algeria who were
ready to conspire against the Fourth Republic.His refusal to condemn disloyalty to the FourthRepublic, or those ready to defy the government
in Paris before he came to power, was sufﬁcient
to encourage the belief that his Algerian policy
would be resolutely French. A master of loftyrhetoric, de Gaulle could be all things to all men.When, three weeks after the fall of the govern-
ment on 5 April 1958, President René Coty had
found no politician able to form a new govern-ment, he consulted de Gaulle. But on 13 May, itwas Pierre Pﬁmlin, a man who was anathema tothe army in Algeria, to whom he turned.In Algiers, 13 May 1958 was the decisive day. Brigadier-General Jacques Massu and
Commander-in-Chief General Raoul Salan, withtheir associates, were practically in open revoltagainst Paris. Although Pfimlin received the
backing of the National Assembly to form the
next government, the conspiracy on both sides of
the Mediterranean was in full swing. De Gaulle
had to make his move. Although it was the insur-rection of the army in Algiers and the threat ofcivil war that were forcing the hands of the pres-
ident and legitimate government of the Fourth
Republic, de Gaulle had to give the appearance
of total independence and personal disinterest inanything except the cause of saving France. In acrucial public statement of 15 May de Gaulle
avoided mentioning the insurrection in Algiers
beyond referring to ‘disturbance in the ﬁghting
forces’; he condemned the ‘regime of the parties’,which he said could not solve France’s problems,and harking back to his mission in 1940 con-
cluded, ‘Not so long ago the country, in its hour
of peril, trusted me to lead it ... to its salvation.

Today with the trials that face it once again, it
should know that I am ready to assume thepowers of the Republic.’ By placing himself at the ‘disposal’ of the French people over the head
of the president, the government and National
Assembly, de Gaulle undermined whatever autho-
rity they might have been able to exert. TheFrench people would not have taken kindly to ausurpation of power led by the army, which
would have provoked protests, riots and wide-
spread civil disturbances.There were still formidable obstacles in the way of a legaltransition of power. After all a gov-ernment under Pierre Pfimlin was functioning and there was no real danger of an insurrection 
in metropolitan France other than by armed units
from Algeria. General Massu knew he would need
to camouﬂage any use of force. He planned a coup in Paris codenamed Resurrection: massdemonstrations would be organised, backed upbyparatroopers airlifted from Algiers and the south-
west region of France who would occupy stra-526THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
tegic government buildings. The crisis reachedfever pitch on 28 and 29 May. De Gaulle’s rela-tionship with Resurrection is one of the most
hotly argued controversies among historians. Had
the general himself given the order to set the coup
in motion or was it Gaullist supporters in Pariswho gave the green light to the army generals inAlgiers? What seems likely is that de Gaulle had
expressed himself in an ambiguous way, yet 
had given clear indication that if he failed to gain
power by legal process, which he preferred, he
would have taken advantage of the Algiers plot.The airlift actually began when six Dakotastook off early in the afternoon of 28 May. That
evening in Paris President Coty called in de
Gaulle and invited him to form a ‘government of
national safety’ since France was on the verge ofcivil war. Coty also had to accept de Gaulle’sdemand that he would take over only if he could
prepare plans for a new constitution; meanwhile
he would govern without the National Assembly.
De Gaulle then agreed that he would be grantedspecial powers for only six months and would ﬁrstneed to appear before the National Assembly for
confirmation as head of government and to
receive authority to plan and submit a new con-
stitution. When they received this news, the gen-
erals postponed Resurrection. The NationalAssembly on 1 June 1958 by a majority voted itsapproval of de Gaulle as head of government with
special powers, but a sizeable minority voted
against him, 224 members out of 553. The fol-
lowing day he received the necessary three-ﬁfthsmajority for submitting a new constitution to theFrench people by referendum. So de Gaulle, at
the age of sixty-seven, had become head of the
government again, but Coty remained president,
an arrangement that conferred legality and con-
tinuity on the interim period that marked the last months of the Fourth Republic.De Gaulle had achieved a constitutional trans-fer of power just this side of legality – but he
could not have done it without the military threat
from Algeria. His immediate problem was nownot metropolitan France but Algeria, where set-tlers and generals, together with French Gaullist
politicians back home, would look upon any
retreat from ‘l’Algérie Française’ as rank treach-ery, which would absolve them from owingloyalty to any government guilty of it. But whatdid de Gaulle really think?It is a question not easy to answer. In lettersand private conversations he seems to have tried
out ideas, using those he addressed as a soundingboard. But he was clearly pragmatic. The conﬂictwould be brought to an end and de Gaulle did
not believe that could be achieved by continuing
to discriminate against the Muslim majority or by
employing military force and the torture of oppo-
nents. He relied on his own immense prestigeamong the settlers and the millions of AlgerianMuslims, to whom he proposed a new deal. To
the ﬁghting men of the FLN he offered an olive
branch by praising their courage. He was under
no illusions that one day Algeria would be inde-pendent, but that independence would be bestachieved gradually and in harmony and in some
form of association with France.For all his rhetoric and grandeur, de Gaullewas far from sure of his ability to impose a policyopposed to the wishes of the French settlers andthe army generals, who were congratulating
themselves on their destruction of the Fourth
Republic. Nor did the killings in Algeria cease
with de Gaulle’s return. Indeed, the savagery was
worse than ever during the next four years, whilethe general seemed to procrastinate, switchingfrom concessionary overtures to the FLN to
renewed efforts to achieve ‘paciﬁcation’, and the
toll of death, maiming and torture mounted. If
de Gaulle really represented, as he claimed, thegreatness of France, is he not to be condemnedfor vainly attempting to save France’s position in
Algeria? The ambiguity of his policies was to be
revealed on his ﬁrst visit to Algeria, only three
days after his investiture. To Algerian Muslims
and the French settler crowds, he proclaimed ondifferent occasions the delphic utterance, ‘I haveunderstood you’; however, in all but one of his
speeches he carefully avoided uttering the piedsnoirs’ slogan, ‘l’Algérie Française’.De Gaulle’s impact on the population inFrance and in Algeria was enormous. The greatmajority of French citizens and of Muslim
Algerians were prepared to place their trust in him
and to be led to new relations and a better future.1THE WAR OF ALGERIAN INDEPENDENCE527
He was the best guarantee that France would not be plunged into civil war. The trouble was thatthe trusting French settlers and military expected
a completely different outcome from that expect-
ed by the trusting Muslim Algerians. Even so, 
the referendum on the new constitution, held in France, in the French Commonwealth and inAlgeria, was a personal triumph for de Gaulle. 
In metropolitan France over 80 per cent voted 
for him. In Algeria, where the Muslim Algerians
could vote with the Europeans on equal terms for
the ﬁrst time, army intimidation cannot accountfor the large majority, of 76.4 per cent, achievedin the face of FLN threats. So why was there no
prompt settlement in accordance with the wishes
of the great majority of Muslim Algerians, who
were clearly ready to accept some form of associ-ation with France? After all, de Gaulle himself was deliberately using the weapon of democracy,
of the majority, as the best means of ﬁnding a
settlement.It was not majorities that decided the issue inAlgeria but the organised force of settlers, theFrench army and the minority of militant
Algerians who made up the FLN. The FLN
would not lay down their arms for anything less
than complete independence. They survived as a
guerrilla force in the country and in urban areasdespite ‘successful’ French military actions,attacking the French settlers and their Muslim
Algerian supporters. De Gaulle’s attempts to
negotiate with them, even at moments of their
greatest military weakness, came to nothing.Moreover, the extremists among the pieds noirssoon recognised that, whatever his personal pref-
erences, de Gaulle would in the end settle with
the Muslim Algerians and abandon the settlers if
need be. These extremist settlers mounted some
thirty assassination attempts against de Gaulle,and one revenge shooting in August 1962 riddledhis car with fourteen bullets and nearly succeeded
in killing him and his wife. In February 1961 they
had formed the Organisation Armée Secrète in
Algeria, soon known throughout the world as theOAS. They declared that they would act as fero-ciously as the FLN and take their terror tactics to
Paris if de Gaulle and metropolitan France tried
to abandon ‘l’Algérie Française’.On 30 March 1961 de Gaulle announced thatpeace talks with the FLN would begin shortly atEvian. This was the signal for an open rebellion
carried out in April by OAS plotters with the
assistance of four retired army generals in Algeria.
But the French army in Algeria was split. Oncemore de Gaulle’s appeals averted the danger ofcivil war. During the long-drawn-out negotia-
tions at Evian, the OAS did their worst, but they
were unable to prevent agreement being con-

ceded practically on FLN’s terms on 18 March
1962. On 1 July that year Algerian independencewas granted after a referendum in France andAlgeria. The previous month the OAS gave up
the hopeless struggle in Algeria. The extremists
had ensured that there could be no future for the
French Algerian settlers, most of whom nowmigrated to metropolitan France.Was it an honourable peace? The French couldnot protect all the Algerians who had been loyal
to them and were now condemned as traitors by
the FLN. Muslim Algerians who had served in theFrench army had numbered 210,000. Only aminority took refuge in France, and it is not
known how many of those who remained behind
were executed or murdered. Estimates vary
between 30,000 and 150,000. The leaders of the
new Algeria later admitted that there had been‘blunders’. Whole families, even children, weremassacred. Many Third World countries have
passed through the suffering of colonial repres-
sion and then through the wars of national liber-
ation, which involved not only the ﬁght againstthe ‘occupier’ but also the savagery of fratricidalcivil war. Algeria was one of the worst examples
of this process. De Gaulle’s military training
helped him to face this inescapable consequence.
Certainly the blame cannot be placed solely on
him.Whatever failings are attributed to de Gaulle inhandling the crises in Algeria from 1958 to 1962,
only his enormous prestige in the army and
among the people of France saved Algeria from
seizure by a rebellious army backed by the set-tlers, and France from a confrontation that mighthave led to a neo-fascist regime in Paris. The
ending of the war was greeted with enormous
relief by the great majority of the French people,528THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
and by none more than the half-million conscriptssent to Algeria. The verdict on de Gaulle offeredby the historian Alistair Horne seems eminently
just: ‘the way he extricated France from Algeria
may not have been done well – but certainly no
one else could have done it better’.De Gaulle succeeded in 1958 in re-establishingthe constitutional authority of France over the
recalcitrant army and rightist extremists. Not least
important among his weapons were his impressive
personal television appearances in which headdressed the nation. Even opponents werebound to admire the authoritative style of the
grand Charles, dressed in the uniform of a
brigadier-general, during these early years of tur-
bulence. He had been given just six months ofrule without parliament to reshape the institu-tions of government. He lost no time. Invested
with special powers in June 1958, de Gaulle
created a consultative committee (which he
chaired) to draft the new constitution. It wasapproved by an overwhelming majority in a ref-erendum on 28 September.The constitution of the Fifth Republic, whichcame into force in January 1959, enormously
increased the powers of the presidency. Under
Article 16 it permitted the president in case ofgrave national crisis to take ‘whatever measuresare required by the circumstances’. Until the
1958 constitution was amended in 1962 by a
further referendum, the president was not directly
elected by the people but chosen by an electoralcollege consisting of all members of the Assemblyand other ‘notables’: de Gaulle was proceeding
cautiously. On paper the prime minister shared
executive power with the president, but the pres-
ident chose the prime minister, and other minis-
ters on the recommendation of the primeminister. On paper, parliament retained consider-able powers. Governments were responsible to it
and were required to resign if the National
Assembly censored them or rejected their pro-
gramme. The prime minister (Article 20) wascharged with determining and conducting thepolicy of the nation and was given responsibility
for national defence as well as the power to
appoint top officials; moreover, his counter-signature was required for treaties. Responsiblefor negotiating treaties and empowered to initi-ate new laws, the president is commander-in-chief
and presides over the Council of Ministers. For
the constitution to work, the government would
have to act as the junior partner of the president,thus eliminating the overlapping powers andpotential sources of conflict. De Gaulle inter-

preted his powers widely and was able in practice
to make decisions in all areas which he regarded
as important, at home as well as abroad. In fact,
he treated the prime minister and the ministers ofthe government like civil servants. The govern-ment was little more than the means by which the
executive presidential will was carried out. Prime
Ministers Michel Debré (1959–62), Georges
Pompidou (1962–8) and Maurice Couve deMurville (1968–9) were the president’s men, andmany ministers were technocrats rather than party
leaders. Their divorce from the political parties of
the National Assembly was emphasised by the
provision that members of the government couldnot hold seats in the Assembly. This was to dis-tance them from the political manoeuvring
among ministers that had caused so much insta-
bility to the Third and Fourth Republics. With
the support of the Gaullists and their allies in the
National Assembly, which following the electionsof November 1958 and November 1962 formedthe largest group, de Gaulle was able to override
such powers as the constitution of 1958 had on
paper awarded to the prime minister, government
and parliament. He established overwhelminglypresidential rule for the period of ofﬁce to whichhe was democratically elected, but was mindful of
the individual liberties and civil rights of the
French. This starkly differentiates de Gaulle from
the dictatorships in Spain, Portugal and much of
Latin America. The president’s position wasfurther strengthened in 1962, as we have seen,when an amendment to the 1958 constitution
replaced indirect election with direct election by
the people for a term of seven years.De Gaulle led France effectively, and by mak-ing use of the special provisions for referendumscould bypass parliament and seek approval for his
policies by popular mandates. He was clearly the
choice of a large majority until at least 1968–9,1THE WAR OF ALGERIAN INDEPENDENCE529
even though there were many who disapproved ofhis highhandedness and regarded his treatment ofgovernments and parliament and his political
monopolisation of radio and television as a threat
to democracy. But there seemed no other choice,
no man of equal stature, who could provide thepolitical stability France so badly needed. DeGaulle had become both intolerable and indis-
pensable.The economic transformation of France, bothindustrial and agricultural, had been rapid since
1949 and accelerated further during de Gaulle’seleven years from 1958 to 1969. This progresswas achieved by a mixed economy, with state
intervention, planning incentives and government
encouragement. Key sectors of French industry
were modernised. De Gaulle adhered to theTreaty of Rome and the economic competition itopened up among the Six signatories. There was
no turning back to France’s traditional protec-
tionist policies, and the free circulation of goods
in the EEC was achieved on 1 July 1968 after theagreed ten transitional years allowed to France: itstrade now had to reorientate towards the new
European markets, which were expanding fast.
France excelled in many branches of the new
high-technology industries – chemicals, aeronau-
tics, oil, precision engineering and automobiles –while cheap power, based ﬁrst on oil and then,increasingly, on nuclear energy, helped to make
it more competitive. Between 1949 and 1969
French economic growth increased by an annual
average of 4.6 per cent in the 1950s and 5.8 percent in the 1960s, so that, having lagged behindits West European neighbours, France overtook
Britain in the 1960s. Its industrial production
index moved as follows:1937100
1949112
1959193

1969341
French agriculture was also rapidly mod-ernised. The number of farms decreased by a thirdbetween 1955 and 1970, with the numbers of
farmers and farm wage-earners declining still
more steeply, while output increased. Agriculture,which has declined in importance within theFrench economy, by the close of the 1960semployed only 16 per cent of the working pop-
ulation, as against more than a quarter just after
the war.The most obvious negative feature of France’seconomic growth was inﬂation, which had beenrapid during the Fourth Republic. On coming to
power, de Gaulle and Antoine Pinay, the ﬁnance
minister, made a determined effort to create a
stable currency. First, the franc was devalued,
then a new franc was introduced. Conﬁdence inthe currency soon returned, and inflation wasreduced. Strikes in 1963 were followed by
another austerity package by the new ﬁnance min-
ister, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. Economic expan-
sion was aided by the sudden increase in thelabour force when nearly a million pieds noirsfrom Algeria emigrated to metropolitan France;
further cheap labour was attracted, especially 
from Italy, North Africa and Spain. In the 1960s
the West European consumer market for cars,refrigerators and television sets seemed to be insa-tiable, and French industry grasped the opportu-
nities provided by this enlarged market. Full
employment was maintained until 1968–9, and
even then, with less than 1 million unemployed
(though the figure alarmed contemporaries),unemployment amounted to no more than 4 percent of the working population.As old traditional structures were adapted tomodern conditions, there were many French who
deplored and resisted these painful changes. TheFrench peasantry repeatedly and sometimes vio-
lently gave vent to their grievances. Artisans and
small shopkeepers protested, while frequent strikes
expressed the frustration of industrial workers. The
increased national wealth, moreover, was unevenly
distributed. The industrial wage-earners did betterthan the non-industrial; skill was rewarded; andmanagement considerably improved its standards
of living. But a society as stratiﬁed as France’s was

exposed to growing tensions that were suddenly to
boil over in May 1968.De Gaulle did not share the enthusiasm for aunited Europe displayed by Monnet and his fol-
lowers and had been critical of the establishment530THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
of the European Economic Community with itssupranational Commission. Would the EEC belaunched at all on 1 January 1959, requiring as it
did France to begin dismantling its protectionist
industrial tariffs? France was in deep financial
crisis, but de Gaulle did not attempt to abort thebirth of the Common Market. For him it was not the economic aspects of the Treaty of Rome
that mattered most, but the political. He now 
discovered important positive aspects and calcu-
lated that through leadership of the European
Economic Community France could regain inﬂu-ence in the world and wrest Europe away fromeconomic and military dependence on the Anglo-
Saxon nations. The recovery of France’s inter-
national position was foremost in de Gaulle’s
mind. An alliance with the US would remainessential to counter the Soviet threat, but thatneed not mean subservience or a European junior
partnership. In a Western Europe still looking to
the US for its defence and advanced technology,
de Gaulle’s was a bold vision of the future.When de Gaulle returned to power in 1958one major obstacle to his ambitions was the so-
called ‘special relationship’ between the US and
Great Britain. Britain was not willing to make a
choice ‘for Europe’ if this entailed weakening its
links with the US and the Commonwealth; andso, although British policy favoured the creationof an industrial free trade area in Western Europe,
the common external tariff, which would operate
against all non-European members as required by
the Treaty of Rome, was unacceptable. But with-out Britain in the Common Market, and withWest Germany within it and anxious not to appear
assertive, France would be the unchallenged
leader of Western Europe. As far as the wider
world was concerned, de Gaulle in September
1958 proposed to President Eisenhower andPrime Minister Harold Macmillan that it shouldbe directed by the US, Great Britain and France.
This policy would have gravely offended
America’s other NATO allies, Italy and the
Federal Republic of Germany, and rejection was aforegone conclusion. De Gaulle simultaneouslysought a special relationship with the West
German chancellor, Adenauer, who was invited 
to de Gaulle’s home at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. The terms he offered to Adenauer werethat Germany should abandon any idea of anuclear partnership with France, that an agricul-
tural common market should be added to the
industrial Common Market of the EEC, and that
France and the Federal Republic should pressahead with the Common Market of the Six inpreference to Britain’s larger Free Trade Associa-
tion. Adenauer assented. De Gaulle, who had
come to power with a free hand, had by the close
of 1958 already achieved much for France and 
had enhanced its international position. The his-toric enmity between France and Germany hadbeen buried and replaced by a new and special
intimacy, which was sealed by the Treaty of
Friendship in January 1963. The French role
would be crucial to the EEC’s further develop-ment. Britain had been excluded and could con-tinue to be excluded as long as de Gaulle chose to
make use of France’s veto. But he wished to shape
the Common Market into a close alliance of sov-
ereign states and opposed the transfer of powersto Brussels, the new headquarters of the EuropeanCommission.De Gaulle’s priority was to reassert France’sposition in the world. It had been excluded from
the wartime settlements and from the nuclear
club. Without its own nuclear weapons Francewould not be given a place at the table of the greatpowers. In September 1959 de Gaulle announced
that France would build up its nuclear strike 
force. But was there any point? France could never
hope to match the Soviet or American arsenals. DeGaulle of course realised this but what he fearedand suspected was that the US might not defend
Western Europe with its nuclear weapons if it
meant destruction of the US. France needed its
own strike force to be independent of others. The
new American doctrine of ‘ﬂexible response’ onlyincreased de Gaulle’s fears that a nuclear warbetween the Soviet Union and the US might be
conﬁned between the Elbe and the Atlantic. The
Americans, moreover, were changing their strate-
gic plans fundamentally without ﬁrst consultingtheir European allies. In February 1960 Frenchscientists exploded France’s first atom bomb.
Then France went thermonuclear with repeated
tests in the Paciﬁc.1THE WAR OF ALGERIAN INDEPENDENCE531
Signals were also sent to the US that Franceregarded NATO as an unequal alliance andrequired change as the price of continued mem-
bership. In April 1959 de Gaulle forbade the pres-
ence of American nuclear weapons on bases in
France; but increasing French pressure forchanges to NATO that would give France a largervoice failed to impress the Americans or the
British. And, however much the Germans wished
to maintain good relations with France, no
German chancellor would run the risk of alienat-
ing the US, on whose support the defence of theFederal Republic against the Soviet Union prin-cipally depended. In July 1966, after years of
growing non-cooperation, de Gaulle therefore
took the dramatic step of withdrawing France
from NATO’s integrated military commandstructure altogether. But he was careful to main-tain its political alliance with NATO. Indeed, de
Gaulle was conspicuous in supporting the US and
the NATO allies in every confrontation with the
Russians, over successive Berlin crises, the build-ing of the Wall in 1961 and the Cuban missilecrisis in 1962.By 1966, de Gaulle appeared to be overplayinghis hand and his policies carried less conviction.
His stately visits to the Third World, Latin
America and Canada earned him personalapplause but no tangible benefits for France,which was seen as dangerously anti-American.
Adenauer’s successors, Erhard and Kiesinger, were
less inclined to accept French tutelage as Germany
recovered not only its economic strength but itsconﬁdence too. De Gaulle irritated his EEC part-ners in 1965 by boycotting the Common Market
when its members tried to move towards majority
voting at the Council of Ministers. After several
months, the French in 1966 won the so-called
Luxembourg Compromise which, in effect,allowed each member to oppose a majority votewhen it considered its vital interests were at stake.
De Gaulle had halted the move toward suprana-
tionalism. This stance accorded with the views of
the British government (which had applied to jointhe club) and ironically made possible the lateraccession of Britain, which de Gaulle had vetoed
in January 1963 and November 1967. France’s
ﬁve partners, too, were now anxious to bring inBritain to check France and did not take kindly tohis Olympian despatch of Britain’s applications.Elected for a second term as president inDecember 1965 on, admittedly, a reduced major-
ity, de Gaulle at the age of seventy-ﬁve was stillseen as indispensable to the maintenance of sta-bility. But Mitterrand, the candidate of the united
left, had also impressed and with 32 per cent of
the vote was only 11 per cent behind the general.
Internationally, de Gaulle had succeeded in
winning back an independent role for France. Thequestion which now arose was what he would dowith it, how he would exploit France’s position
to break the superpower deadlock. A visit to the
Soviet Union in the summer of 1966 led to agree-
ment on Franco-Soviet consultations, but deGaulle could make no headway in achieving hisreal aim of freeing Europe from Soviet and
American military dominance. The time was not
yet ripe for de Gaulle’s vision.In world affairs de Gaulle took up positionsdiametrically opposed to American policy. Headvised the Americans to leave Vietnam and
during the 1967 Six-Day War reversed France’s
traditional policy of support for Israel against the
Arabs. Visiting Canada that summer, his behav-
iour seemed downright quixotic when he encour-aged separatism in French Canada by declaring inMontreal, ‘Vive le Québec Libre’. This was
blatant interference in Canadian affairs, though
French inﬂuence had been lost for good in that
country two centuries earlier. Visiting Poland, deGaulle openly encouraged Polish nationalism.Not only did de Gaulle surprise the world with
his policies and pronouncements, but the per-
sonal exercise of power began to cause misgivings
in France too. By the close of the 1960s, a great
swing of the pendulum was in the making. Frenchsociety was no longer uniformly ready to trust andfollow its remote and grand leader. The divisions
made themselves felt in the explosion of May
1968, which almost removed de Gaulle; he mas-
tered the crisis but his prestige was irreparablydamaged.The May outburst had several causes, some of them loosely connected. It was followed by 
an apparently overwhelming Gaullist electoral532THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
victory, some belated reforms and a rapid returnto calm and stability. Was it just a brief period ofturbulence of no great signiﬁcance? With hind-
sight, the events of 1968 look different, the
dramatising of a change in Western society that
had been slow in the making. It was a revolt inthe ﬁrst place against authority: in the professions,and especially among would-be professionals in
the universities, it marked a rejection of preor-
dained patterns, of subservience and patronage,
and of the concomitant corruption. It was a revolt
of youth, against an older generation that it heldresponsible for the mismanagement of the past.With the security provided by the welfare state,
relatively full employment and student grants,
students no longer had to concentrate on pro-
viding their daily needs but could aspire to some-thing better. The success of the assault on thebastions of privilege and archaic structures in edu-
cation and the professions was uneven, but a
recognition of the need for change, a loosening
of rigid hierarchies and the granting of a largerrole and greater freedom to the younger membersof society have been among the positive results of
1968. It reﬂected a movement evident through-
out Western society during the 1960s and 1970s.The May crisis in France revealed the frustra-tions of an active minority section of the popula-tion, no longer conﬁdent that change could beeffected through the existing channels of bureau-
cracy and government. Thousands took to the
streets, giving the upheaval its particular character:
half revolution, half carnival, shaking off the strait-laced conformist stupor identiﬁed with GaullistFrance. The crisis was easily mastered because,
outside certain parts of Paris, France remained
profoundly conservative in attitude, a conser-

vatism affecting all parties from left to right, as
politicians of all shades preferred to lead themasses rather than to have them take control intotheir own hands. The efforts of the small group of
extremist students, such as the Marxist Danny
Cohn-Bendit, who were working for revolution-
ary change, were doomed to failure, though for ashort while they drew the limelight on themselves.The red ﬂags and non-stop speeches by students
in Nanterre and the Sorbonne were not the real
stuff of which revolutions are made, but theincrease in student numbers to more than half amillion nationally since 1958 had made them asigniﬁcant force. The repressive police actions in
response might have become a more serious cause
of revolution, because they were met by counter-
violence in the streets of Paris, reinforced by bar-ricades and burning cars.One reason why revolution did not break outwas that workers did not make common cause
with the intellectuals and students, and this was so
even though the workers had their own griev-
ances. The growth of their real wages had been hitby an austerity economic programme, and unem-ployment, though small, was rising. Trade unions,
receiving no cooperation from management,
called a strike, and workers throughout France
spontaneously occupied factories. But the unions,the communist one included, were seeking betterconditions, not revolution. De Gaulle, incredu-
lous at the sudden storm, left crisis management
to Prime Minister Pompidou. At the height of the
crisis, on 29 May, he secretly withdrew and, nearbreaking point, ﬂew to a French military base inBaden-Baden, West Germany, intending to depart
permanently from ofﬁce and from France, but
General Massu persuaded him not to give up and
the following day he returned to Paris. Pompidou,
left to himself, had in the meantime bought offthe unions with large concessions. By the time deGaulle reappeared to broadcast a plea for massive
support and for a counter-demonstration to the
previous left-wing march on the Champs Élysées,
the response was immediate and impressive. InJune disturbances were practically over. Studentswent on their vacations and the workers returned
to work. The National Assembly, with its slender
Gaullist majority in 1967, was dissolved in June
1968 and France gave its verdict at the polls: the
opposition was severely weakened and theGaullists secured an overwhelming majority. Butthis was not quite the positive vote for de Gaulle
that it appeared to be. It was a fearful reaction
against the left, and a display of support for
Pompidou, whose moderation had brought suc-cess. De Gaulle knew this and promptly droppedPompidou, appointing Couve de Murville as his
successor. Fresh economic problems were coun-
tered with another austerity programme in the1THE WAR OF ALGERIAN INDEPENDENCE533
autumn in preference to devaluation. By thespring of 1969 de Gaulle had decided to put hisleadership to the test by another referendum on
the issues of regional devolution and the reform of
the upper house of parliament. His call for support
for French people to choose between him and‘upheaval’ rang hollow. On 27 April, 52 per centvoted against and de Gaulle promptly resigned.French society was now sufﬁciently stable andmature to beneﬁt from a less authoritarian styleand from new leaders who did not claim to
embody the mystic spirit of France. Yet it is difﬁ-
cult to escape the conclusion that de Gaulle had
been necessary and that Gaullism, with all itsdrawbacks, had provided a bridge between the oldregime and the new.534THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
The war had been won by the British peopleacting in rare unison. Traditional class differences
were softened by the wartime experience of
common danger and loss. But in all essentials theclass structure survived and was to impedeBritain’s post-war progress. It survived above all
in education, so denying equal opportunities to
talented children from the lower classes. Social
mobility improved, but far too slowly. The ﬁrst
post-war Labour government, though not revo-lutionary, did move the country in new direc-tions, taking a gradualist road to impose more
state control and planning on private industry,
and to provide through social legislation a society
that would care for the basic needs of all.Labour’s social policies were more successful thanits industrial ones. Britain’s wealth was more equi-
tably shared but it was created at a slower rate
than the more successful European economies
achieved after the war. The Labour government
of 1945–50 enacted the measures that laid thebasis of the post-war welfare state. It also set upthe National Health Service and nationalised the
coal and steel industries and the railways. The
enactment of such a large and radical legislative
programme required many compromises, andthese, together with the avoidance of direct statecontrol, ensured that Britain did not experience
the kind of socialist revolution imposed on the
communist states of Eastern Europe.The ﬁrst post-war Labour government presidedwith success over the transition from peace to war.The miseries of the 1920s and the 1930s hauntedLabour politicians and the working people alike.
Careful planning and staggered demobilisation of
the millions serving in the armed forces ensuredthat jobs were waiting for the returning men – andthat they would not be temporary jobs, as many of
them had been after the First World War. Strict
rationing was continued, low wages and subsidised
food prices kept the cost of living down, while the
provision of health care and social security wasspreading a safety net for the lowest incomegroups. In comparison with devastated continen-

tal Europe, Britain in the post-war 1940s was rel-

atively well off. There was a market for all it could
produce and as yet little serious competition. Theimmediate problem was the balance of payments:Britain did not export enough to earn the dollars
to pay for imports from the US, to continue high
defence expenditure abroad and to feed the British
occupied zone of Germany, whose people would
otherwise have starved. It still saw itself as a worldpower, the number three behind only the US andthe Soviet Union, and, though recognising that
the American alliance remained the indispensable
ﬁrst condition of West European security, deter-

mined to maintain an independent capacity todefend itself and its still far-ﬂung imperial inter-
ests. In 1945 it seemed unwise to count on any
long-term US commitment to Western Europe. In
any case, British and American interests overseas
frequently clashed, as for example in the MiddleEast.1Chapter 49BRITAIN
BETTER TIMES AND RETREAT FROM EMPIRE
The Labour government was as passionatelyattached to parliamentary democracy, civil liber-ties and the independence of the law as any pre-
vious administration. But it also showed a much
greater concern for social justice. The early post-
war years were an ‘age of austerity’ for the fewmillions who before the war had enjoyed higherstandards of living, more varied food and cheap
domestic servants, but it was also an age during
which the much more numerous poor for the ﬁrst
time were freed from the fear of unemployment,
the workhouse, sickness, hunger and a pauper’sburial. As a nation the British people had neverenjoyed such good health, subsisting on adequate
rations that kept the people lean. Characteristic of
the period was the word ‘utility’ which was widely
stamped on furniture and clothing to denotegood standard quality without frills.By pre-war standards, Britain made soundprogress as its factories switched to peacetime
production. A major problem was how to earn
enough dollars from exports to pay for theimports Britain needed to feed its population, toprovide tobacco and to get industry moving. That
Labour recovered from the crisis year of 1947 was
due less to Attlee, who provided little leadership,
than to Stafford Cripps, who as chancellor of the
exchequer emerged as the strongman. His stricteconomic policy, wage restraint and cuts inspending put Britain back on course. But despite
Marshall Aid, Britain ran into renewed crises and
devalued the pound in 1949 from its pre-war rate
of $4.03 to $2.80. Bread was rationed for the ﬁrsttime from 1946 to 1948. When Labour ﬁnally fellfrom power in 1951, after winning the 1950 elec-
tion by so narrow a margin of seats that Attlee
decided to call another election, Britain was still
enjoying a higher standard of living than its con-
tinental neighbours. There was a small drift ofsupport from Labour to Conservative, 3 per centin 1950 and a further 1 per cent in 1951. It was
just sufﬁcient to end the ﬁrst Labour era of post-
war Britain.The elections brought Churchill back to power,the Conservatives holding 321 seats and Labour
295. The swing was not remarkable given
Labour’s six years in ofﬁce; the socialist leaderswere becoming old and sick. Sir Stafford Crippsretired in October 1950 suffering from cancer,Bevin died in April 1951 and Attlee also fell ill.
A split within the Labour movement also became
publicly known and weakened the party. The left-
wingers led by Aneurin Bevan were outraged bythe introduction of a charge for spectacles andfalse teeth, which destroyed the principle of a
completely free National Health Service. Bevan
and Harold Wilson, a rising young star, there-
upon resigned from the government. But the
majority of Labour supporters did not wish to gofurther on the road to socialism, and extendingnationalisation was not popular. Labour’s reform-
ing zeal had weakened in the face of the practi-
cal constraints of the slowly recovering economy.While Labour declined, the Conservative Partystruck a note that appealed to the voters of ‘grey’Britain, promising to rid the country (which was
tiring of uniformity and the continuation of
wartime rationing) of unnecessary restrictions and
regulations – but they also undertook to maintainthe new welfare state created by Labour. The mostimportant of their assurances was that they would
maintain full employment: the new Conservatism
was laying the ghosts of the 1930s. For all these
reasons – and a redistribution of constituency
boundaries had also aided the Conservatives –they won power in 1951 and held on to it withoutinterruption for thirteen years until 1964.Churchill was back at Number 10. Seventy-seven years of age, he was still a statesman of
world stature who could speak on equal termswith Truman and Stalin. This obscured the factthat Britain had ceased to be a world power when
measured in terms of economic strength. With 
R. A. Butler, who accepted all the Beveridge
Report stood for, at the Exchequer, the country
was assured there would be no return to pre-warToryism. Churchill’s Cabinet contained ministerswho wished to reshape Conservative ideology to
encompass more concern for the poor; they
believed in the healing power of consensus
politics, in the acceptance of the welfare state andin the application of Keynesian economics tocounter the effects of cyclical depression. Butler,
the most senior member of the government after
Churchill, represented this now dominant wing of536THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
the party, though its most radical exponent wasHarold Macmillan. Macmillan was entrusted with redeeming Tory pledges to build 300,000
houses a year, and he succeeded brilliantly. Lord
Woolton was another popular minister; responsi-
ble for food, his success was inexorably linked tothe rising meat content of the British sausage.Anthony Eden at the Foreign Ofﬁce enjoyed a
national prestige, in part based on his resignation
before the Munich settlement and in part on his
close association with Churchill during the war.The last Churchill administration set the guide-
lines for successive Conservative governments formore than a decade. In overseas relations and for-

eign affairs British policy followed ﬁve comple-

mentary aims: to strengthen as far as possible the
alliance with the US; to maintain an independentmilitary capacity as a great power by joining thenuclear superpowers, the USSR and the US, in
building atomic weapons; to defend what were
regarded as Britain’s essential worldwide economic
and strategic interests in eastern Asia and theMiddle East; to promote cooperation among theCommonwealth countries and to adjust to a new
relationship; and, ﬁnally, to assist as an ally West
European defence without becoming embroiled in
continental moves for closer collaboration. This
combination of policies, reﬂecting what were then
the perceived national interests, was based on amixture of foresight and rather more hindsight. It
delayed Britain’s decline in inﬂuence in world

affairs only to hasten it later, as the attempt to play
a more independent role revealed Britain’s grow-
ing inability to sustain it. At home these effortsoverseas diverted resources that were badly needed
to renew the industrial base. The retreat from
power is more difﬁcult to manage successfully than

mastering the problems of expansion.In fostering the American alliance, Britainhoped to counterbalance its declining strength byemphasising the historic special relationship that
has often been said to bind together the two
English-speaking countries. British statesmen
could also emphasise their country’s long experi-ence of world affairs and saw themselves as ableto provide wise counsel to their ‘inexperienced’
American cousins. In the real world most of these
assumptions were illusory. Despite its nuclearcapacity, Britain ceased in the 1950s to beregarded as the third world power. Anglo-American interests in the post-war world coin-
cided on some questions, especially the defence
of Western Europe against Soviet threats, but
they could also diverge, especially in the MiddleEast. That was to be demonstrated starkly overSuez in 1956, after Anthony Eden had taken over
the premiership. The American alliance, and
America’s continued commitment to European
defence, which could not be taken for granted in
1945 or 1946, has remained the cornerstone ofBritish foreign policy, but since the 1950s Anglo-American cooperation could not truly be said to
amount to an exclusive or a special relationship.Britain’s choice of the nuclear option did notgive it the added weight in world affairs its leadersexpected from it, nor did its role at the head of thetoo-disparate Commonwealth. For a time, Britain
was the only nuclear power besides the Soviet
Union and the US. In 1946 the Americans had
repudiated agreements to share with Britain thesecrets of the bomb, so Attlee decided to developan independent bomb. Research and development
in Britain, however, reached fruition only in 1952,
a year after the Conservatives had returned to
power. Even then the full lethal consequences of
radiation were not understood; Britain’s chief sci-entists had recommended that the atomic tests beconducted off the coast of Scotland. In the event,
Monte Bello Island off the coast of Australia was
chosen and, in consequence, Australian rather
than British lives were unknowingly jeopardised.Only a month after Britain’s ﬁrst successful test in1952 the ante was raised when the US demon-
strated the much more destructive thermonuclear
bomb, the H-bomb. Churchill was determined to
keep pace with the US and the Soviet Union:
Britain would not surrender the option of pursu-ing independent policies. Five years later, in May1957, Britain carried out its own successful H-
bomb test. By then Harold Macmillan had taken
over the premiership from Eden after the 1956
Suez ﬁasco. A strong adherent of both traditionalBritish independence and the American alliance,Macmillan was able to restore some glow to the
special relationship by persuading Eisenhower to
resume Anglo-American nuclear cooperation.1BRITAIN537
Britain failed to develop its own missiles tocarry the nuclear warheads and so was obliged tobuy them from the US. In December 1962
Macmillan met President Kennedy in the Bahamas
and successfully negotiated the Nassau Agree-
ment, under which the US undertook to supplyPolaris missiles to be ﬁtted to British-built atomicsubmarines. This Anglo-American deal was to
have profound implications for Anglo-French
relations and so for Britain’s attempts to join the
Common Market in the 1960s, because de Gaulle
interpreted it as evidence of a British decision toopt for the US rather than Western Europe and ofa British desire to relegate France to a second-class
status. As a result, in 1963 the general turned
down Britain’s application to join the Common
Market. Although eventually Britain and the USsought to pacify their non-nuclear NATO allies bysetting up in 1966 joint nuclear defence commit-
tees, which would share nuclear planning rather
than weapons, the French – who by now had their
own nuclear missiles – maintained their refusal to participate in NATO’s integrated nuclear struc-ture and went their own way, testing their
weapons in the South Paciﬁc.The continuous nuclear debate highlights thesigniﬁcance of these decisions at home and inter-

nationally. At home the horror aroused by aweapon of indiscriminate mass destructionprompted in 1958 the largest popular protest
movement of post-war Britain, the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Originally its moral
appeal cut across traditional party and class lines.CND became a powerful radical movement led bymiddle-class left-wingers, who sought to persuade
the Labour Party to abandon the bomb unilaterally
and so give a moral lead to the world. Within the
Labour Party, demands for unilateral disarmament
became a serious embarrassment for its leadersfrom Gaitskell to Neil Kinnock in the 1980s.Britain’s ﬁvefold policy aims looked ﬁne onpaper, but the essence of a successful and coherent
strategy is that all its elements should harmonise
and that its priorities should be ordered correctly.Britain was handicapped by its success in theSecond World War and by its unbroken historical
tradition. It would have been difﬁcult to foresee in

the 1950s the rapidity of Western Europe’s recov-
ery from the war. Towards its European neigh-
bours Britain followed a policy of a partial com-
mitment. This involved encouraging the collabora-
tion of the Western European states, the Federal
German Republic, France, Italy and the Benelux
countries, without embroiling Britain too closelyin their emerging political and economic arrange-
ments. Britain saw its role as a powerful ally – sup-

porting, together with the US, the strengthening
of Western Europe rather than trying to lead it.
This was partly because considerable importance
was still attached economically and politically toBritain’s ties with the Commonwealth, the inde-
pendent Dominions – Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa – which were joined by
India and Pakistan and later by many former
colonies as they gained independence.In colonial and imperial affairs Britain continued toadjust gradually to the new realities, but not with-

out difﬁculty. Even if it had wished simply to aban-

don its colonial possessions quickly, it could not bedone without conﬂict. There were always rivalsready to take Britain’s place, who even before its
departure tried to make good their claims by ﬁght-

ing for them. British troops, and often their fami-

lies too, were exposed to terrorism. Palestine was,
thus, only the ﬁrst of many quagmires.
Cyprus, an important British base, ﬂared intoviolence in 1955 after the British, Greek and
Turkish foreign ministers, meeting in conference,
failed to agree a solution to the problem of the
island’s self-government. The leader of the GreekCypriots, Archbishop Makarios, representingsome 80 per cent of the inhabitants, wanted
union with Greece, enosis, which was anathema tothe Cypriot Turks. Britain wanted to retain a
secure base, which became all the more import-
ant after the Suez debacle in 1956. A terror cam-paign was launched on the island by EOKA (theNational Organisation of Cypriot Struggle),
headed by a former Greek colonel, Georgios
Grivas. Greece was backing the Greek Cypriots,
and Turkey followed suit, backing the TurkishCypriots with still greater militancy. Only in 1959was there sufﬁcient agreement between Britain,
Greece and Turkey to allow the setting up of an
independent republic of Cyprus, whose Turkish538THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
minority population was granted special safe-
guards, with both Greece and Turkey promisingto respect Cypriot sovereignty. Britain secured
two sovereign bases. It was a solution imposed
from outside by the three powers, one that denied
the majority of the islanders the right of unionwith Greece. Cyprus enjoyed an uneasy peaceunder Makarios, interspersed with serious conﬂict
between the Greek and Turkish communities,
until the ﬁnal breakdown, the Turkish invasion
and the effective division of the island into separ-
ate Turkish and Greek halves in 1974. Theproblem remains no less insoluble today, but ithas ceased to be Britain’s responsibility, having
been handed over to the UN, like so many other
lost international causes.In Malaya, Britain was more successful. Adetermined military campaign was waged against acommunist revolt started in 1948 with the objec-
tive of seizing power from the British. There were
some 4,000 of these communist guerrillas, ﬁght-
ing fanatically from bases deep in the jungles. Butthe insurgency was defeated by 1954 and Britaingranted independence to the Federation of
Malaya three years later. Singapore was made self-
governing under the terms of this settlement, but
became completely independent two years later.In the same year in which Malaya was grantedindependence, Britain began its retreat from colo-nial dominance in West Africa: the Gold Coast
attained independence as Ghana in 1957, Nigeria
in 1960, Sierra Leone in 1961 and Gambia in
1965. The Commonwealth had become multi-racial, a force (it was hoped) for racial harmony inthe world. Britain appeared to be shedding its
responsibilities and burdens with grace and little
hardship. Macmillan, in a speech before the
United Nations, reﬂected the false optimism of
the time when he declared in 1960, ‘Who dares tosay that this is anything but a story of steady andliberal progress?’ Yet the 1960s were soon to wit-
ness the breakdown of British-style parliamentary
rule in the West African states, and Nigeria was
plunged into civil war.Britain’s withdrawal from its East and CentralAfrican colonies proved far more difﬁcult than
withdrawal from the West. Here, the white settlers,
who claimed the land as their own and who pos-
sessed disproportionate wealth and held dominantpower over the black majority, foresaw that major-
ity rule and independence would mean the end of
their pre-eminence. Nevertheless the Conservative
government succeeded in 1961 in reaching a satis-

factory settlement in Tanganyika, which withZanzibar soon after became the state of Tanzania.In contrast, the relinquishment of control in and
the granting of independence to Uganda in 1962
started the country on a path of tribal rivalry and
bloodshed. In Kenya, the 30,000 white settlers
and Europeans wielded more inﬂuence than those
in Tanganyika, so the path to independence herewas more violent. As in Malaya, Britain faced a
major uprising in the 1950s organised by the Mau
Mau, a militant secret society comprised mainly of
Kikuyu. Britain reacted to this revolt by banningblack political activity and using military force.Military action, as in Malaya, was successful, but,
unlike in Malaya, the black independence leaders
were not on the British side – they were all in
prison. Macmillan, proclaiming the ‘wind ofchange’ in a celebrated speech in South Africa in1960, pressed on with the decolonisation policies,
which placed Kenya under black majority rule and
gave it independence in 1963. But, from the
British point of view, the policy of ‘steady and lib-

eral progress’, pursued with a mixture of militaryforce, ﬂexibility and diplomacy and intended totransfer power gradually to black political lead-
ers, came seriously unstuck in Central Africa.
Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, which became
the independent states of Malawi and Zambia in1964, had been federated with Southern Rhodesia.Here a white minority of settlers held all political
power, but their demands for independence could
not be accepted in the progressive climate of the
1960s. The position had changed radically in the
half-century since the white South Africans hadobtained all political power and had beenentrusted with the future of the country. Now the
Commonwealth was multiracial, with Asian and
black member states. South Africa was forced to
leave it in 1961.Talks intended to lead to a settlement inSouthern Rhodesia broke down in 1965 and the
white Rhodesians declared their unilateral inde-
pendence in November. The new prime minister1BRITAIN539
Harold Wilson sought a solution by negotiatingwith the Rhodesian premier Ian Smith, a formerbattle of Britain pilot, who enjoyed considerable
public support in Britain, not least because what
was happening in the Congo and Uganda was a
bad advertisement for black rule. The British gov-ernment had neither the will nor the backing touse force to topple Smith and impose majority
rule. Instead, economic sanctions were adopted,
but they proved leaky, with oil and other supplies
reaching Rhodesia through South Africa and
Portuguese Mozambique. Smith was able to holdout until 1979: the issue was decided in Africaand not in London. Britain, once at the centre of
imperial power, had moved to the sidelines.What is surprising to foreign observers is theequanimity with which the majority of the Britishpeople accepted the loss of empire. To the serving
British soldier direct experience of the squalor and
poverty of what became known as the Third
World was a reality that replaced the romanticsimple patriotism of a bygone age. Only a minor-ity who had directly benefited mourned the
passing of the Raj. Realistic Conservatives did not
reverse Labour policies after 1951, as might have
been expected if Churchill had been taken seri-
ously, but extended and hastened the process ofgranting independence. To the man in the streetsetting former colonials free did not solve the
problem: they emigrated to Britain, making use
of their rights as subjects of the Crown to settle
in the home country, though only a small pro-portion of the population of the empire did so.There was nothing new in the experience ofaccepting immigrants – Russian and, later,
German Jews and, during the Second World War,
foreign allies from many nations, had settled in
Britain. Large numbers of Poles, some 157,000,who had fought with the British refused after thewar to return to their country, now dominated by
the Soviet Union. The Polish miners of Mansﬁeld
with their own social club, the German refugees
in Swiss Cottage, and other nationals elsewherein Britain exhibiting different cultures wereaccepted with tolerance and good humour. Their
British-educated children were soon indistin-

guishable from the rest. Although immigrationaroused some contemporary argument, the assim-ilation of more than 300,000 immigrants pre-sented no long-term problems, and their early
concentration within certain areas gave way
within a generation to their spreading out and
absorption throughout the British Isles. Thesewere the white immigrants.The problem of immigration from the formercolonies and the new Commonwealth countries
proved different. Immigration of West Indians
and Asians did not begin in the 1940s and 1950s
– in London, and in seaports such as Cardiff andLiverpool, sizeable black communities had alreadysettled, attracted by the prospect of work. The
essential features of the problem revealed them-
selves from the start. There is a natural tendency
among all immigrants to concentrate in particulartowns among their own peoples with similar cul-tural backgrounds. Here they are more protected
and can expect some assistance. Discrimination 
by whites meant that immigrants obtained only
labouring jobs, and not even those when employ-ment became scarce. Moreover, the assumption of racial superiority and acts of prejudice drove 
an increasingly impoverished black commu-
nity back in on itself. Violence in what became 
virtually ghetto areas fed on discrimination and 
resentment. In 1919 there occurred serious riotsin Cardiff, Newport and London. In Liverpoolpeople of Carribean or African descent were
attacked by a mob.The assimilation of black immigrants has notproceeded as quickly and smoothly as that of thewhites. Communities of Asian people and peopleof African descent take pride in their own culture
and distinctiveness, frequently reinforced by their 
own religious observances. West Indians, the
black people from the colonies and Indians 
had all been welcomed as ﬁghting men during the war, and after 1945 West Indian labour wasencouraged to come to Britain to ﬁll jobs for
which there were not sufﬁcient whites. London
Transport, for instance, recruited 4,000 workers
in the Caribbean, and the National Health Servicecould not have functioned without cleaners and nurses from overseas. Need reduced preju-
dice. Increasingly doctors from India and the
Commonwealth entered the Health Service too,540THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
thus draining the Third World of the educatedand skilled personnel it could spare least of all. Ithas been estimated that by 1973 more than aquarter of the doctors in the National Health
Service had not been born in the British Isles.When immigrants wishing to escape the povertyof their homeland could no longer be absorbed by
a growing British demand for their labour, pres-
sure for control of immigration grew stronger.Now arguments were added explaining why the
‘New’ Commonwealth citizens were no longer
welcome in Britain. The 1962 Commonwealth
Immigrants Act ended unrestricted immigration,
and the exclusion of immigrants later became still
more rigorous. But the entry of new groups, such
as some 100,000 East African and Ugandan Asiansholding British passports, driven out in the late1960s and 1970s by racial and economic resent-

ment and by greed for their wealth, the arrival of
dependants of existing immigrants, the small num-

ber of new immigrants, and the second-generation
children born to the original immigrants, all
enlarged the Commonwealth communities inBritain from 392,000 in 1962 to 1.85 million in1976, out of a total population in Britain of 55
million.Would racial conﬂicts explode into bloodshedas the former Conservative minister Enoch Powell
prophesied? Such dire predictions proved wide of
the mark. The vast majority of African and Asian
immigrants and their descendants are peaceable,hardworking and assert their right to be British in Britain’s multi-ethnic and multi-religious 
contemporary society.Britain has come a long way since Americanblack airmen (of the USAAF) landed in 1944 in
a Norfolk village whose inhabitants had neverseen a black man before. Britain is now a multi-ethnic society and a new generation has beenborn into it. Racial differences are commonplace,accepted as part of life in Britain today, while
intermarriage is more frequent. Just as the rigid
barriers between Jews and Christians have broken
down and anti-Semitism has greatly diminished,so racial prejudices have lessened. The signiﬁcanceof the immigrants’ contribution to the wealth of
Britain still needs to be fully emphasised and set
against the problems. Even these are not simply
racial. In times of depression and high unem-
ployment the deprived inner cities have ventedtheir anger and frustration against the forces ofthe establishment, whose most visible manifesta-
tion is the police. The evils of unemployment
have increased criminality and the maintenance of
law and order has been perceived by the deprivedas tinged with racism. Yet the spectacular riots of the 1970s and 1980s are the exception and 
not the rule; the violence of the few attracts more
attention than the patience of the many.There was a broad consensus among the Britishpeople from the 1950s to the 1970s about the
kind of society they wanted: gross poverty and
misfortune, whether through ill health or old age,
to be banished by the state’s provisions of welfare
and medical care; decent standards of housingand education for the population as a whole; agrowing supply of consumer goods, the pleasures
of a car for every family and summer holidays
away from home; an expanding economy to
bestow these beneﬁts; greater personal freedom ofchoice in lifestyles and the shrinking of the fron-tiers of legal sanction on questions of morality; a
move away from authoritarian ‘Victorian’ stan-
dards; and ﬁnally a decent livelihood for all, with
full employment. The maintenance of law and
order was taken for granted, respect for the lawand the police was almost universal, violence theexception. In seeking the good things in life,
there was an expectation that they could be
attained without too much effort, by a kind of
natural progression, though interrupted fromtime to time by brief setbacks.CND was an overwhelmingly peaceful move-ment whose respectable leaders, with Canon
Collins of the Church of England at their head,1BRITAIN541

were accompanied by a few policemen at theirritual Easter march to Aldermaston. The Teddyboys, the Mods and the Rockers provided more
entertainment than serious teenage challenge, to
be tolerated good-humouredly. At the same time
the more cerebral Angry Young Men conﬁnedtheir rebellion against the prevailing materialisticmood of complacency and optimism to novels
and the theatre. Harold Macmillan caught the
prevailing mood in his often quoted phrase:
‘Most of our people have never had it so good.’
But class divisions remained, with great inequali-ties of wealth, an educational system that despitewidening opportunities did not provide anything
like equal opportunities. Discrimination for senior
positions was based on unconscious assumptions
in favour of their ‘own kind’. Preference forOxbridge graduates in the foreign service, in theCity and elsewhere persisted.Throughout these three decades, both majorparties, Labour and Conservative, could count on
a bedrock of class support. Elections were decidedby the ﬂoating voters. To ‘ﬂoat’ was not a difﬁ-cult ideological feat since there was so much
common ground between the two parties on
foreign affairs, defence and the welfare state.
Judgements by the ﬂoaters were based on which
party could provide the more competent primeminister, and which party’s policies promised todeliver that steady advance of the economy that
had eluded the party in power; the ﬂoating voter
was frequently voicing the need for a change, a
vote against the party in power, rather thanexpressing ideological convictions. Labour inpower was not intent on extending socialism but
was willing to work with the mixed economy.
Conservatives were ready to accept the social leg-
islation of their Labour predecessors.From 1950 to 1970 there appear to have beenonly relatively small shifts in voting patterns, the biggest swing towards or away from Labour
was less than 5 per cent. Only Labour and the
Conservatives secured sufficient support to be
considered credible government parties, theLiberal Party being unable to break the two-partymould. In fact, the traditional Labour working-
class base was shrinking and British politics was
moving towards a radical reshaping in the 1970s.Churchill’s 1951–5 administration will be remem-
bered for the old wartime giant whose now rarespeeches could still inspire. But few outside the
inner circle of politicians knew how physically
impaired the prime minister had become, as the
result of two strokes. His well-tried ministerial col-
leagues performed well enough, except for R. A.Butler at the Exchequer, who gave the economy
too great a boost just before the election by lower-

ing income tax, only to have to raise it immediately
after it was won. Macmillan’s success at hous-
ing did more than any other single policy ofChurchill’s administration to restore faith in theefﬁciency of private enterprise and the free market.
The hybrid policy of encouraging private enter-

prise while maintaining the main features of the
welfare state, a harmonisation of Labour andConservative economic and social policies, becameknown as ‘Butskellism’ (Hugh Gaitskell had been
Labour’s chancellor of the exchequer).Churchill kept Eden, his unchallenged heir,waiting too long. Eden had ﬁrst entered govern-ment twenty-six years earlier as a junior minister.He had spent a lifetime in diplomacy, emerging
unscathed from the condemnation of 1930s
appeasement thanks to his break with Neville
Chamberlain in 1938. As Churchill’s lieutenant in
foreign affairs he had served the country through-out the Second World War. He again demon-strated his diplomatic skill as foreign secretary
after 1951. The future of Western Europe was
still uncertain in 1951. Could former enemies,
especially West Germany, be trusted? The thorni-est problem was whether, and under what con-trols, to permit German rearmament as part of the
joint defence effort of the North Atlantic Treaty542THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s

Organisation. The Americans pressed for WestGerman rearmament, while the French, lookingback on their historical experience, felt grave mis-
givings. The attempt to overcome these difﬁcul-
ties by creating a West European Defence
Community (the Pleven Plan) ﬁnally failed whenthe French Assembly rejected ratification inAugust 1954. Britain had been willing to join not
as a full member but only as an ally, thus indi-
cating again its unwillingness to give up its status
as the third great power and to combine with its
continental allies as an equal European. Eden wasthe principal architect of the compromises thatcreated the framework for West European
defence at a nine-power conference over which he
presided in London in the autumn of 1954. This
was followed by the formal treaty signatures, theParis Agreements, in October. With the admis-sion of Italy and the Federal Republic of
Germany, the Brussels Treaty Organisation was
superseded by a Council of West European
Union. That winter West Germany was admittedas a member of NATO. The Federal Republic ofGermany had been restored to full sovereignty,
but had agreed to certain restrictions, the most
important of which was not to manufacture
nuclear weapons. Berlin alone retained its status
as an occupied city, since any Western alterationof the agreements reached with the Soviet Unionwould have opened the way for the Russians to
declare them void. Eden had demonstrated full
British support for a restored West Germany and
for the military defence of Western Europe inalliance with the US and Canada. Thus WestEuropean Union and NATO were closely linked.
But the British policy of keeping its distance from
continental Europe was also conﬁrmed.Eden’s second triumph was to preside over andbring to a successful conclusion the GenevaConference in 1954, which extricated Francefrom Indo-China. Unfortunately in the longer
term this proved to be only another act in the
tragedy of Vietnam. In the same year as these
diplomatic successes Eden began to negotiate thetreaties intended to place Anglo-Egyptian rela-tions on an entirely new and friendly basis; they
provided for the withdrawal of the British from
Suez, but allowed the retention of the militarybase in emergencies. A group of ConservativeMPs responded by accusing him of weakness.Eden was hypersensitive to charges of appease-
ment, and the shadow of Munich was to over-
whelm his good judgement. The fuse was laid for
the Suez Crisis two years later. Churchill ﬁnallyaccepted retirement in April 1955, the unavoid-able consequence of his age and ill health. Eden
called an election in May and won comfortably.The new prime minister entered 10 DowningStreet with the broad support of the party and
Conservative voters behind him. Yet the impres-sion soon grew that he lacked the leadership qual-ities of a prime minister. The economy was not
going well either. Eden’s health was suspect and
the constant disparagement unsettled him, by
nature impatient of criticism. The Suez invasionhad widespread support from a public that sawthis drastic action as a signal to the rest of the
world that Britain could not be pushed about.
But a more considered view, highly critical of
Eden, was expressed among both Conservativeand Labour members of parliament. Gaitskell(who had replaced Attlee as leader of the Labour
Party in December 1955) was particularly vehe-
ment in his attacks on the prime minister. When
the Suez expedition failed, Eden’s health com-
pletely broke down and he left London to recu-perate in the West Indies. During his absenceButler acted as de facto prime minister.When Eden resigned in January 1957, the pre-miership did not pass to Butler, as had been widelyexpected. Since the Conservative Party had noleader, the queen sought the advice of senior
Conservatives, among them Churchill and Lord
Salisbury. Soundings were also taken among min-
isters. The shadow of Munich and appeasement
still clung to Butler, and the preferred candidatewas Harold Macmillan. His record seemed to beone of brilliant achievement. As Churchill’s repre-
sentative in the Mediterranean from 1943 to
1945, he had mastered the complex political
problems of rival French, American and Britishinterests in North Africa and later in Italy. Shrewd,ambitious, tough and ruthless when the need
arose, Macmillan politically dominated the decade
from the mid-1950s until ill health and fatigue1BRITAIN543
loosened his grip. Although he had occupied thesenior ofﬁces of state during the short space of1951–7 – Housing, Defence, the Foreign Ofﬁce
and the Exchequer – Macmillan had been the out-
sider among Conservatives in the 1930s, accept-
ing the new economic theories of John MaynardKeynes and castigating the policies that he blamedfor the unemployment of that decade. Intensely
patriotic, he wished to rebuild Conservatism to
embody the vision of ‘one nation’, the creation 
of harmony between the classes. By promoting
social mobility, the Conservatives would loosenadherence to the Labour cause. The large univer-sity expansion of the 1960s helped to serve this
end among others. The working people of 
Britain were not the enemies to be kept at bay, 
in Macmillan’s philosophy, but the ‘sturdy men’who had defeated the Kaiser’s and Hitler’s armies.They would respond to a policy of fairness that
gave them a share in growing prosperity. Un-
employment was an evil and not an option of pol-
icy. The majority of his countrymen, Macmillanbelieved, would respond to an emphasis on tradi-tional British values and to a paternalistic aristo-
cratic style of leadership. It was a cleverly packaged
update of Disraeli’s Tory vision.Macmillan was the ﬁrst British politician tomaster the new television medium. He presentedhimself as the disinterested statesman–gentlemanwho would lead the country to reform without
tears, the antithesis of the puritan ethic, which
preaches that only what hurts can be truly bene-
ﬁcial. His style of government was conciliatoryrather than confrontational, both at home andabroad. After the shock of Suez a more careful
alignment of policy to match British resources in
the world had become necessary. Indeed the
Conservatives were at a low ebb when Macmillan
took over. Yet, less than three years later,Supermac (as a cartoonist christened him) hadrestored the party’s morale and increased its share
of the vote in the October 1959 election sufﬁ-
ciently to win an overall majority of 100 seats in
the House of Commons. The Labour Party, it istrue, was not well placed to ﬁght that election, itsrank and ﬁle divided between unilateral disarmers
and Gaitskell’s majority in favour of retaining the
bomb, and between those who wished to extendnationalisation and Gaitskellites who believed thatnationalisation was not only irrelevant but anelectoral handicap. The Liberal vote had more
than doubled, but in the absence of proportional
representation the party was left with exactly the
same number of MPs as before – a mere six.How had Macmillan brought about the recov-ery? What had the Conservatives achieved? In
foreign affairs, the deleterious effects of Suez were
overcome and good relations with the US
restored. Macmillan also played the role of world
statesman with relish, attending summits withEisenhower in Bermuda and Khrushchev inMoscow before the abortive Geneva Conference
in 1960. He had the sangfroid to react coolly 
to Soviet threats over Berlin and the vision to
press on with independence for former Africancolonies. And he was astute enough to recognisethat a world role could place unacceptable
burdens on the British economy and frustrate the
goal of greater prosperity. Britain still kept
700,000 men under arms and maintained con-scription, devoting a larger share of its grossnational product to defence than did its conti-
nental neighbours. The far-reaching Defence
White Paper of 1957 saw the solution in relying
on a nuclear deterrent, reducing the armed forces
to 400,000 and abandoning conscription infavour of professional forces. Meanwhile, almostunnoticed in Britain, the European Economic
Community had been created by the Rome
Treaties of 1957. Britain had rejected the oppor-
tunity to become a founder member on theground that it did not wish to weaken itsCommonwealth ties. Macmillan still saw Britain
as playing a world role, not as just another
European nation such as the Federal Republic 
of Germany, France or Italy. But rather than be
isolated, Britain formed the European Free TradeAssociation (EFTA) with Austria, Denmark,Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. These nations
undertook to eliminate tariffs between each other,
but they did not adopt a commontariff. This wasone essential difference between them and theEEC, which levied a common tariff against exter-nal agricultural imports in order to protect the
less efﬁcient French and German farmers. Britain
remained free to import cheap agricultural544THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
produce from New Zealand, Australia, Canadaand elsewhere in the world. The Treaty of Romeappeared to be contrary to Britain’s economic
interests and its supranational aspects were dis-
tasteful to its government and Parliament, which
wished to retain undiminished sovereignty. In thisrespect Parliament was at one with the majorityof the people.In a few years the Six would outstrip Britainin economic growth and prosperity. It is in ret-
rospect curious that Supermac’s electoral success
was in no small measure due to the feeling thatBritain was on the right course and that standardsof living would rise uninterruptedly in an era of
full employment. This optimistic view was but-
tressed by the people’s insularity and their
ingrained belief that Britain did all things best.The economic stagnation of 1957 and 1958 werequickly forgotten and expansive government bud-
getary measures produced a boom in 1959 and
1960. Macmillan had timed the election well.Macmillan’s second administration (1959–63)did not fulfil the promise of the first. Theeconomy was soon thrown into reverse as Britain
yet again faced economic crisis, with each crisis
more serious than the last. Ensuring full employ-
ment was an undertaking that might no longer be
possible to honour as unemployment reached800,000 during the winter of 1962. The nuclearoption did not turn out to be nationally inde-
pendent – as it had to rely on US missiles. The
‘remedy’ of a new boom engineered by the last
of Macmillan’s series of chancellors of the exche-quer proved no remedy at all, whether for theeconomy or for the Conservatives’ chances of 
re-election in 1964. Macmillan meanwhile sought
the limelight in the role of statesman, asserting
British inﬂuence on the basis of its great experi-
ence as a world power. In reality his part in bring-ing about the American–Soviet detente thatfollowed on the Cuban missile crisis in October
1962 was marginal. But the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty of 1963, which sought to prevent the
spread of nuclear weapons, undoubtedly owedmuch to Macmillan’s persistent diplomacy and hetook justiﬁable pride in his achievement. On the
negative side, it reinforced Britain’s illusions that
it had retained its great-power status as a member,along with the superpowers, of the exclusivenuclear club.As Britain’s weak economic performancebecame evident, Macmillan turned towards the
Six, whose progress and growing inﬂuence threat-
ened to leave Britain on the sidelines. Britain now,in August 1961, made a belated bid to join thembut, characteristically, did not come as a suppli-
cant – it was offering its political experience and its
own internal market as bait, and in return
expected special terms that would allow preferen-
tial entry into Britain of Commonwealth food andraw material exports and also permit Britain tomeet its new obligations to fellow EFTA partners.
Britain might have realised its essential aims had it
been a founding member in 1957; now, four years
later, the difﬁcult bargains struck between the Six,and especially France’s success in protecting itsbackward agricultural sector, had created a suc-
cessful going concern. Each of the six member
states believed that its national interest was best
served by the maintenance of the EEC, and werenot prepared to jeopardise it, even though the lesspowerful Benelux countries and Italy would have
welcomed a counterbalance to the Franco-
German axis of Adenauer and de Gaulle. Public
opinion in Britain was deeply divided, with many
people suspicious of foreign entanglements.1BRITAIN545

CorbisNegotiations for a package deal neverthelessseemed to be making reasonable progress when deGaulle in January 1963 brought them to a halt,
declaring that Britain’s Commonwealth ties and
Atlantic interests prevented it from becoming a
fully committed European partner. It was a body-blow to Macmillan’s aura of success.Supermac’s second administration proved adisappointment to the electorate, not least
because the brakes had been applied to the 
economy immediately after the election of 1959.
The new chancellor Selwyn Lloyd attempted tointroduce a ‘pay pause’ in 1961, but lack of agree-ment with the trade unions doomed it to failure,
and its application to the wages controlled by gov-
ernment led to strikes by railwaymen, postmen
and nurses. In 1962 Macmillan replaced SelwynLloyd with Reginald Maudling, who exuded con-ﬁdence and optimism, qualities much needed in
the face of growing unemployment, particularly 
in the north, which reached 800,000 in the 
winter of 1962–3. Maudling went for an expan-sionary policy and planned to break out of thedreary ‘stop–go’ cycle of deﬂation and boost and
achieve sustained growth by accepting a substan-
tial once-and-for-all deﬁcit on the balance of pay-
ment. The problems this caused were inherited by
Harold Wilson’s Labour government in 1964.Macmillan appeared to have lost his magictouch. With the economy in difﬁculties, Britain’s
attempt to join the European Economic
Community vetoed by de Gaulle, and the ‘inde-
pendent’ nuclear deterrent dependent onAmerican missiles, the only relative success wasthe continued disengagement from colonial
responsibilities: in Africa, Nigeria, Sierra Leone,
Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia and
Zanzibar all gained their independence between
1961 and 1964, as did Cyprus, Malta, Trinidadand Jamaica, and the queen gained many newtitles as former colonies became sovereign
members of the Commonwealth. But independ-
ence did not solve all problems at a stroke.
Nigeria was to be rent by a terrible civil war, andUganda suffered grave misfortunes at the handsof its own rulers. In Cyprus internal conﬂicts have
not been resolved. The problems of Rhodesia
were to plague successive Conservative andLabour governments for more than a decade. Butthe most serious problem facing not only Britainand the Commonwealth but the Western world
as a whole was the denial of equal rights to the
non-white majority in South Africa. By 1961
South Africa had recognised that it had becomeimpossible for it to remain in the new Common-wealth, the majority of whose members were now
Asian and African countries. But Britain retained
close and friendly relations with South Africa, par-
ticularly in trade, while at the same time rejecting
the policy of apartheid. Opposition, however, wasconﬁned to rhetoric and, later, sporting contacts;Macmillan, in one of his more memorable
speeches, admonishing his white South African
audiences in 1960 that he had been struck by 
the strength of African national consciousness:the ‘wind of change is blowing through thecontinent’.Macmillan was soon to feel the ‘wind ofchange’ much more immediately at home.
Conservative voters, disillusioned with the gov-ernment, seemed to be switching to the Liberalsin droves. Macmillan took drastic action, reshuf-
ﬂing his Cabinet in 1962 by sacking an unprece-
dented number of Cabinet ministers simultane-
ously, a display of ruthlessness that became
known as the Night of the Long Knives. Thensecurity scandals began to haunt the governmentand to throw doubt on Macmillan’s grip on
affairs. The most dramatic concerned John
Profumo, the secretary of state for war, who had
shared an attractive mistress with a Soviet militaryattaché. There was probably no breach of securityin bed, though nobody could listen in, but the
secretary of state, having earlier denied the asso-
ciation in the House of Commons, later admit-
ted to it and resigned. A sexual scandal in high
political places was, of course, a great mediaevent. Macmillan was described as gullible andfailing. In the House of Commons Labour’s bril-
liant young leader, Harold Wilson, made the most
of the government’s discomﬁture. But Macmillan,
perhaps the most astute and skilful politician ofthe post-war era, might still have recovered hadhis prostate not incapacitated him in October
1963. He was rushed from Downing Street to
hospital and there resigned the premiership.546THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
Italy remains persistently self-effacing in inter-
national affairs. The Italian people have with relief
turned their back on the ‘glorious’ years of the
bombastic duce. Two decades of fascist rule andtwo bloody European wars brought Italy to apoint in its history in 1945 where it seemed
unlikely again to exert a major inﬂuence.Italy emerged with Britain, France, the FederalRepublic of Germany and Spain as one of the 
big ﬁve democracies in Western Europe, with apopulation comparable in size and a largeeconomy to match, which in 1987 generated
about one-fifth of the gross national product 
of the European Community. The Italians have
concentrated their talents on their own welfare.The post-war years were in many respects decadesof achievement and success, of rising standards 
of living, though they were also years beset by
problems.The fortunes of war decided Italy’s future inthe ﬁrst place. It was the Allied armies of the Westthat liberated the Italian peninsula in 1944 and1945. Italy thus found itself on the Western ‘free
nation’ side of the great post-war divide of
Europe. This determined not only its inter-
national position after the conclusion of the peacetreaty on to February 1947, but also its internalpolitics and social developments. Italy’s relations
with the East (and its markets there) were cut off;
economically its future lay in close relations with
the West. Liberal economics, the abandonment offascist autarchy or self-sufficiency, the Italianversion of a more socially responsible capitalism,all set Italy on a fundamentally Western path of
political and economic development. The politics
of post-war Italy were dominated by the ChristianDemocratic Party, ﬁrmly committed to a parlia-mentary system. In the post-war world Italy
moreover occupied a crucial strategic position in
the Mediterranean and Adriatic, and was seen as
a bulwark against communist south-east Europe.Yet impoverished Italy in the early post-waryears, in the aftermath of the destruction and dis-location of the war, facing dire poverty in many
regions and with an industrial proletariat in the
north, did not appear secure against a communist
takeover from within. The resistance had attractedthe working masses to communism, especially inthe north. The Italian Communist Party now
numbered 2 million, the largest in the Western
world. According to Cold War ideology, a com-
munist anywhere had but one purpose, to subvert
democracy and to seize power violently when the moment was ripe, following the successfulmodel Lenin had created in 1917; it was believed,
moreover, that all communists were totally sub-
servient to Stalin and followed the dictates of the
Kremlin. In 1945 the partisans in the north ofItaly were strong and there were many commu-nists among them who believed that the hour of
revolution had indeed struck, but, disciplined and
obedient to their leadership, they took care to
avoid any direct challenge to the anti-communistAnglo-American forces.1Chapter 50THE TRIBULATIONS AND SUCCESSES OF
ITALIAN DEMOCRACY
The Italian Communist Party after 1945behaved in a way that was contrary to communisttradition, deliberately seeking general acceptanceby shedding its violent revolutionary image. The
party was led by the astute veteran Palmiro
Togliatti, who had returned from Moscow as
recently as 1944. The communists would prevail,he believed, only by following a democraticcourse, winning mass support among the Italian
people ﬁrst and then dominating society from this
position of strength. It would take time. This was
a rejection of Lenin’s revolutionary line andTogliatti had to assert himself against the moreardent traditional communists. Stalin probably
approved this strategy for communist parties in
Western Europe, where the ‘Anglo-Saxons’ had
taken ﬁrm control, because he hoped to be left in
peace to consolidate Soviet power in central andEastern Europe. Togliatti’s avowal of the consti-tutional, non-violent path to socialism prepared
the way for a close electoral alliance, virtually a
fusion, with the Socialist Party, which was led by
another veteran and Togliatti’s companion inarms during the Spanish Civil War, Pietro Nenni.One pivotal question for the future would bewhether a democratic left, including the commu-
nists but not necessarily dominated by them,
would emerge in post-war Italy. The year 1947
was crucial for the future of Italian politics. TheUS and Britain had identiﬁed a critical Sovietchallenge in Europe: Turkey was under pressure
and in Greece civil war was raging: they were, in
Truman’s words, ‘still free countries being chal-
lenged by communist threats both from withinand without’ – while in Poland and the rest ofEastern Europe the Soviet Union and the indi-
genous communists were tightening their grip.Truman’s response was to offer the democraticWestern European states US support – diplo-matic, economic and military. The outcome wasthe Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The effect of
this support on Italian politics was that the
Christian Democratic leader Alcide De Gasperi,after a visit to Washington, forced his commu-nist–Socialist partners out of the governing coali-
tion in May 1947.The heightening tensions of the Cold War alsocreated enormous strains within the communist–Socialist pact. Could the communists continue to be trusted? A minority among the Socialists led
by Giuseppe Saragat demanded that their party
break off their close relationship with the commu-
nists; when they failed to persuade their col-
leagues, they left the party in 1947 and eventuallyformed the Italian Social Democratic Party(PSDI). By giving up the struggle within the 
party and splitting the socialists, the PSDI left the
communists in a position from which they were
able for the next three decades to dominate theleft. Thus the communists opposed the MarshallPlan, though earlier the communist–Socialist
alignment had accepted American economic aid.
But the communist and Nenni Socialists were
never strong enough to form an alternative gov-
ernment on their own, nor could they ﬁnd anyother small parties to join them to provide amajority in parliament. Domestically the Com-
munist Party tried to make itself acceptable by
espousing democracy and a multi-party system, 
an Italian road to socialism. But the autocraticorganisation and leadership principle which theCommunist Party itself strictly adhered to under-
mined confidence in the authenticity of their548THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s

Czechoslovakia in February 1948, opposed Italy’s
membership of NATO and military links with the
US, were against Italy’s membership of theEuropean Economic Community and failed todenounce the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956.Not until nearly two decades later did Italiancommunism openly take a lead in the formation of
what became known as Eurocommunism, a policy
of independence from Moscow and the US, andthe declared pursuit of national interests. In fact,Togliatti had been critical of Moscow long before
this, and a change of attitude had been evident,
for example, with the acceptance by the commu-
nists of membership of the European EconomicCommunity in 1962. But it was the Soviet inva-sion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the brutal asser-
tion of Soviet dominance over a supposedly
sovereign country, albeit a Soviet ally, that pro-
voked the broad Eurocommunist movement ofWestern Europe. By the mid-1970s, the Italiancommunists were even sanctioning NATO.The acceptable face of communism, with itsenhanced appeal to the electorate, caused even
more apprehension in Washington than did tra-
ditional communism. In this respect little hadchanged in Washington’s assessment over fortyyears. In the immediate post-war years, commu-
nism was believed to be deriving its support
mainly from conditions of poverty and misery,
and there were plenty of those in Italy andEurope. Opponents of communism were givenﬁnancial aid and sustained by whatever means
were possible. But, since former enemies were
being taught the arts of democracy, interference
could not be too obvious. To safeguard the
Western alliance from a communist takeover inItaly, a very secret organisation called OperationGladio, named after the double-edged Roman
sword, was set up. It was to play a sinister and
corrupt role in Italian politics, though its exis-
tence was not uncovered until a judicial investi-gation in 1990.The threat of communism had a beneficialeffect for Western Europe and Italy too. Extensive,
predominantly American, aid was sent to Italythrough the United Nations Relief and Rehabili-
tation Administration (UNRRA), then the USprovided direct economic aid, because (in the som-

bre words of a State Department Policy Planning
Staff report) the margin of safety politically and
economically in Western Europe had becomeextremely thin. These stop-gap forms of aid werefollowed after 1948 by the planned approach of
Marshall Aid.Between 1948 and 1952, Italy received morethan $1,400 million in US grants and loans. So
once the Italian economy had taken off in the1950s, state, private and foreign capital ensuredan investment rate in industry that fuelled rapid
expansion. The millions of Italian immigrants
who lived in the US made this largesse easier to
justify. But in general it was appeals to America’sown self-interest and above all the need tocontain communism that persuaded Congress and
the American public to provide such a huge trans-
fer of resources to Italy and Western Europe.One of the more important objectives of theMarshall Plan was to bring the non-communistEuropean nations into closer collaboration. The
means was the European recovery programme,
which was to be planned jointly by the European
participants. In April 1948, sixteen countries
signed a treaty which, for this purpose, set up the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) with headquarters in Paris.
The sixteen countries were Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Britain, Greece, Iceland, the
Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg, the Nether-lands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerlandand Turkey, together with the three Western
zones of Germany. Italy was one of the full mem-
bers, but its adherence to this block of non-
communist nations still seemed problematical to
Washington, even after the resounding victory ofthe Christian Democratic Party in the elections of1948. Contrary to the experience in the Western
zones of Germany, the Cold War had not discred-
ited the Italian Communist Party in the eyes of the
Italian electorate. American hopes that MarshallAid would weaken the communist left remainedunfulﬁlled.In its relations with other countries, Italy hasnot sought a leading role. In the aftermath of the1THE TRIBULATIONS AND SUCCESSES OF ITALIAN DEMOCRACY549
war, the dispute over the Trieste territory createdsome agitation until it was resolved in the mid-1950s. An agreement with Austria in 1969
settled the only other problem affecting its own
territory, the Alto Adige region or South Tyrol,
with its predominantly German-speaking popula-tion, though irredentist terrorism still upsets internal law and order in this region from time to
time. Post-war Italy has not aggressively sought
any special areas of influence in the Mediter-
ranean. In a revulsion against wartime experience
and imperial vainglory, the Italian people wish to be left in peace and to leave others in peace.Italy’s policy has been to maintain good rela-
tions with all its neighbours and to keep out of
conﬂicts in the region, whether in the Middle East
or over Cyprus. There is, indeed, a strong neutral-ist tendency noticeable in the attitudes of the major political parties. But successive Christian 
Democratic-led coalitions have remained ﬁrm in
the Atlantic orientation, the alliance with the US,
the membership of NATO and the EuropeanEconomic Community. For four decades Italianforeign policy has been strikingly consistent.Consistent would not be an appropriate descrip-tion of Italy’s policies at home. Italian democ-
racy’s unique feature is that government has notalternated between a party in power and a partyin opposition. The communists and their allies,
the Nenni Socialists, polled between 31 and 36
per cent of the votes at general elections. Even
after the Socialists had broken away from thecommunists in 1963, the communists polledmore than 30 per cent of the vote on their own.
Only the Christian Democrats could also claim to
be a mass party, attracting some 38 per cent of
the votes. None of the many other parties even
reached 10 per cent.Since neither the Christian Democrats nor thevarious small parties from the centre to the fascist
right would accept communists in the national
government, the communists formed a virtually
continuous opposition, while the ChristianDemocrats remained permanently in power, form-ing various opportunistic alliances with smaller
parties in order to carry the necessary vote of con-
ﬁdence in parliament. But there were constantconﬂicts between the coalition partners, as fre-quently over personal differences as over questionsof policy, the distribution of ministerial posts
being an especially rich source of animosity. Party
discipline hardly exists outside the Communist
Party; indeed, because voting in parliament issecret, party members can vote with impunityagainst their own ministers in office. Personal
ambition became a major cause of instability.
Between 1944 and 1988 forty-seven Italian gov-
ernments came and went. After a short-lived
period of stability from 1983 to 1986, the patternof frequent change resumed. Another importantfeature of Italian politics is the strength of grass-
roots organisations and dependent interest
groups. Decades of uninterrupted power have
enabled the Christian Democrats to look aftertheir clients through patronage, from high civilservice appointments to postmasterships.Italian Christian Democracy, which containselements of both left and right, has no distinct
ideology of its own and represents no single inter-est group. It is not the party of industry and bigbusiness, but industry and big business have no
other mass party to turn to. Moderate conserva-
tives also support the Christian Democrats. At the
same time state intervention in industry has been
a consistent feature of Christian Democratic gov-ernment, coexisting with private enterprise and,of course, private property in the mixed Italian
economy. In its early years particularly, the party
had the advantage of the support of the Vatican.
Through the parish priests, especially in thesouth, the support of the peasants was won forChristian Democracy, to set against the support
of the urban workers for the communist–Socialist
alliance. But the conservative landlord also votes
Christian Democrat. Yet Christian Democracy,
though avowedly dedicated to Catholic values, isnot simply a confessional party. Its unifying spiritis a virulent anti-communism, and since the
1950s it has sedulously contrasted communist
policies with its own pro-Western European and
Atlantic ties.Alcide De Gasperi, prime minister fromDecember 1947 to August 1953, headed eight
successive governments. His anti-fascist creden-
tials were impeccable. One of the founders of the550THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
People’s Party, a newspaper editor and a memberof parliament in 1921, he opposed Mussolini andwas imprisoned for his pains. On the intervention
of the Pope, he was released in 1929 and spent
the next few years quietly employed in the
Vatican as a librarian, stealthily making contactwith Catholic anti-fascists in Milan, Florence andRome. Already in his sixties, he joined the active
resistance and earned wide respect, though he
lacked the charisma of a really popular leader. A
practising Catholic, his relations with the Vatican
remained close, but during the last years of hispolitical life he was careful not to let the Churchdominate the Christian Democratic Party. After
leading governments of national unity until May
1947 he thereafter headed coalitions with small
centrist parties, though the 1948 elections hadgiven the Christian Democrats – as it turned outfor the only time – an absolute majority. By the
time of De Gasperi’s sudden death from a heart
attack in 1954 (he had resigned the premiership
a year earlier) Italy was set on a course embody-ing moderate, conservative policies and featuringan economic boom, increasing integration with
the Western alliance and West European eco-

nomic union.For four decades the Italian electorate hasshown extraordinary stability in its political pref-erences. This seems to indicate that the associa-tions and benefits the party could confer on
individuals were at least as important as consider-
ations of national policy. Shifts in voting patterns
were small, though sometimes crucial when itcame to bargaining to secure parliamentarymajorities for legislation.De Gasperi resisted Vatican pressures to allywith the right; instead, the Christian Democratsestablished centrist coalitions with a reforming
programme. In the south, land reform divided up
large estates and gave land to the peasants to
farm. The government also wanted to lessen thedivisions between the poorest regions and theindustrial north. The Southern Italy Fund was
created to ﬁnance the building of infrastructures,
roads, aqueducts and irrigation schemes. The
hope was that tax concessions and various induce-
ments would tempt private industry south. Laterin the 1950s the government established factoriesin the south, but few succeeded. The results of all
these reforming efforts fell far short of their aims.The Christian Democratic share of the votesdeclined after the high point of 1948 throughoutthe 1950s and early 1960s and with this loss thecentrist coalitions became increasingly vulnerable,
ﬁnding themselves in a minority in overall parlia-
mentary votes. This, together with the tensions
within Christian Democracy as the reformistslooked left and the conservatives sought to moveto the right, was the main cause of government
unsteadiness. The Christian Democrats attempted
to bolster their parliamentary position by copying
a fascist device: they changed the electoral law so
that an electoral alliance gaining just over half ofthe popular vote would obtain an almost two-thirds majority of the seats in parliament. The
communist and Socialists bitterly attacked the
‘swindle law’.But the new electoral law did not help theChristian Democrat centrist coalition in the elec-tions of June 1953, because they just failed to gain1THE TRIBULATIONS AND SUCCESSES OF ITALIAN DEMOCRACY551

fore had to rely on the votes of the right, the gov-ernments from 1953 to 1958 had difﬁculty in
maintaining their reforming policies, though some
progress was made, particularly the adoption of a
ten-year development plan designed to reduceunemployment in the more backward regions ofItaly through increasing investment. But for most
of the decade the centrist coalitions were locked in
a domestic stalemate, concerned with keeping
their clients happy. Thus the Christian Democrats
in the south worked with the Maﬁa and the land-lords and also tried to assist the peasants; while inthe north-east, the Christian Democrats appealed
to workers and industrial leaders. The main polit-
ical principle was not to represent a cohesive ideol-
ogy but to amass as much support as possible fromwhatever source.There was movement politically on the lefttoo. The communist and Nenni Socialist alliance
fell slowly apart under the impact of events in the
Soviet empire following Stalin’s death in 1953.Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin’s crimes inFebruary 1956 shocked the Socialists, but the
invasion of Hungary in November of the same
year was even worse for the image of commu-
nism. Though Togliatti declared the Italian
Communist Party independent of the Kremlinleadership, he could not hold the Socialists, whonow accepted NATO as well as the need for a
multi-party state, as a necessary safeguard against
dictatorships of the Stalin variety. The Nenni
Socialists nevertheless moved slowly; not untilJanuary 1959 did the Socialist Party Congress for-mally approve the break with the communists.
Meanwhile, Amintore Fanfani, who was the
dominant politician of the Christian Democrats in
the late 1950s and 1960s, led the party away from
the right-centre support which could no longercommand a majority in parliament. The politicalcrisis reached its climax in 1960, when for months
no government capable of winning acceptance by
the Chamber of Deputies could be formed. The
choice for the Christian Democrats was betweenthe fascists and the Socialists, the latter alignmentbitterly opposed by the Vatican and the right
wing of the Christian Democratic Party itself. But
the Vatican’s Italian politics were also changingunder the inﬂuence of a reforming pope, JohnXXIII. Even so, not until December 1963, afterfurther government crises, did Aldo Moro,
Fanfani’s successor, manage to form a coalition
government that included Nenni’s Socialists.The change to a Christian Democratic align-ment with the small Socialist Party did not,however, lead to any lasting stability. The rela-
tionship was an uneasy one in the 1960s. The
Socialists feared that they would lose votes to
parties standing to their left, especially the com-
munists, if socialism was watered down too farand the new coalition did not pursue vigorousreform and economic planning. Fanfani had
nationalised the electricity industry in 1962, as
the price for Socialist cooperation, but as far as
planning and social reforms were concerned,Moro, his successor, was cautious. He had in hisown party, after all, a suspicious right wing to
contend with. The key feature of the political
landscape was the health of the economy. The
extraordinary period of economic expansion hadnot come to an end, but it was certainly deceler-ating just at a time when trade unions and
workers had become far more strident in pressing
their demands. During the previous ﬁfteen years
the industrial north had been transformed, and
contributing to this transformation was the lowcost of labour, the Italian worker having failed togain any but small rises.The Italian economy from 1945 to 1963 hadbeen built on the back of low wages. The proﬁts
made by successful industrial expansion tended tobe ploughed back, rather than distributed toshareholders or to the workers. This was made
possible by two features of the Italian economy:
there was a large labour pool from the south,
which kept unemployment high and so weakened
trade union bargaining power, though it is truethat between 1946 and 1973 there was a netmigration loss of 3 million people (7.1 million
emigrated, 4.1 million immigrated); and there
was no large group of shareholders to satisfy.
Since the fascist years, the Italian state had indi-rectly controlled a large variety of industriesthrough the IRI, a holding company for indus-
trial reconstruction dating from the depression.
The IRI controlled the banks which, in turn,552THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
owned large holdings in engineering, steel, ship-yards and armaments. After 1945, it also inaugu-rated public works programmes in the south, but
its most important contribution between 1945
and 1955 was the modernisation of the steel
industry, basic to the success of private industry,which was complemented and supported by thepublic sector. After a period of great inﬂation up
to 1947, the Italian governments’ ﬁscal policies
produced price stability until the 1960s, which
helped to create the right conditions for indus-
trial growth. State investment in housebuilding,transport, railways and motorways, television andtelephones and agriculture fuelled that growth in
the 1950s. Through another holding company
the state also developed the huge gasﬁeld in the
Po valley, and a petrochemical industry grew up.Entry into the Common Market in 1957 as afounding member was good for exports, Italy’s
most efﬁcient industrial sectors in private hands
having been poised to take full advantage of the
removal of tariffs. The most successful of Italy’sindustrial giants was Fiat. Other Italian manufac-turers became household names throughout
Western Europe: Olivetti, Pirelli, Snia Viscosa
and, in chemicals, Montecatini; their dynamic
managers made Italian cars, office machines,
domestic appliances, rubber products, textiles andchemicals fully competitive with those of the restof the world. The increase in Italian production
from 1958 to 1963 reached a peak that came to
be called the ‘economic miracle’. But the growing
prosperity of the north contrasted with continuedstagnation in the south. The gulf of wealth andpoverty between Italy’s regions widened.Industry’s easy years of expansion, proﬁts andhigh investments based on low wages came to an
end in 1963. For the ordinary people, however,living standards continued rising in the 1960s;with low unemployment rates the unions recov-ered in strength. Wage rises now regularly out-stripped productivity and the country began 
to suffer again from a high rate of inflation.
Economic growth became erratic, the kind of
stop–go policies familiar in Britain as balance-of-payment difficulties forced successive govern-ments to tighten the economic reins in the
mid-1960s. Nevertheless, the 1960s, when judged
as a whole, still showed outstanding economic
growth when compared with the rest of Western
Europe. Italy held its own in the Common Marketand in world competition, with substantial exportsof cars, washing machines, refrigerators, typewrit-
ers, textiles, chemicals and consumer goods. A
ﬂair for design, good marketing and managerial
skills kept the best of Italian industries abreastwith the best in Europe. Where Italy began to loseout was in the new, less labour-intensive techno-
logical industries of the third industrial revolution.
Italians were in danger of being overtaken unless a
programme of modernisation was instituted. LikeBritain, Italy fell behind the world competition inthe 1970s. The south remained backward, with
employment and wages much worse than the
north, although successive governments made
large-scale investments. Public development funds
and regional reforms consistently failed to pro-duce the hoped-for results.The years 1968 and 1969 mark a watershedbetween two decades of stability and steady
growth and a period of social, economic and
political impasse, conﬂicts and crises. In 1968, theyear of student revolt, youth challenged attitudesand authority all over Western Europe. The new
generation in their twenties and thirties were no
longer content with what had been achieved since
the end of the war: their standard of comparison
was not with the depression of the 1930s or themiseries of war and defeat. They had grown up1THE TRIBULATIONS AND SUCCESSES OF ITALIAN DEMOCRACY553

what was being provided. The political leadership
from left to right had followed the road of com-
promise and bargain, while the young activistshad utopian visions of social revolution andregeneration. The shining example of democracyand prosperity, the US, was cast in the role of bar-baric aggressor in Vietnam. The disillusionmentwas as exaggerated as the earlier admiration had
been, and riots broke out in the cities. While the
froth on the surface of these exciting events soon
blew away, in Italy the year 1968 had a long-termimpact on industrial relations and economicgrowth.554THE RECOVERY OF WESTERN EUROPE IN THE 1950sAND 1960s
1Part XII
WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD
WORLD? 1954–68The fragile stability achieved after the Korean Wararmistice (1953) and the Geneva settlements of
the Indo-Chinese question (1954) did not last
long. With the rise of Khrushchev, the SovietUnion was pursuing a much more dynamic andaggressive policy in regions from which its inﬂu-
ence had previously been almost wholly excluded.
The USSR had backed Nasser’s Egypt in the
Middle East; it had sought to offset American
economic pressure by purchasing Cuba’s princi-pal export, sugar; in civil war in the recently inde-pendent Belgian Congo (now Zaire) it supported
the left-wing leader Lumumba (and so began
meddling in Africa); in Europe relations were
uncertain still over the issue of divided Germanyand in particular over the future of Berlin. Insouth-east Asia after the defeat of the French by
Ho Chi-minh and General Giap in the summer
of 1954, there appeared to be a chance of a nego-
tiated solution. The Geneva Conference of that
year had resulted in a number of agreements andcompromises. The fighting was ended, andVietnam was divided close to the 17th parallel,
with the North Vietnamese controlling what
became the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,
recognised by the communist states; in the southarose the anti-communist Republic of Vietnam.Vietnam, it was proposed, would be uniﬁed again
following elections in July 1956. In Laos, which
was not divided, the communist Pathet Lao had
made far less progress, though they were grantedde facto control of the two northern provinces.The French undertook to withdraw their forcesfrom Laos and Vietnam, and no foreign troops
were to enter those countries or to establish bases
there; excluded from this provision were a speci-ﬁed number of military advisers – thus a smallFrench mission continued for a time in South
Vietnam and Laos.The two crucial features of the GenevaAccords were thus that Vietnam and Laos were
to remain unitary states whose future would bedecided by elections, and that no foreign troopswere permitted to assist North or South Vietnam.
But, from the start, the prohibition against the
introduction of foreign ‘arms and munitions’
(Article 4) was a dead letter. Eisenhower andSecretary of State Dulles regarded the GenevaAccords as appeasement of communism and a
defeat for the free world. They dissociated them-
selves from the agreements but promised not to
overturn them by force provided there was no
aggression from the North. They also expresseddoubts about the all-Vietnamese elections andinsisted that they be held under the auspices of
the United Nations. The South Vietnamese gov-
ernment, headed by the Catholic Ngo Dinh
Diem, refused to sign any of the treaties butcarried out the military truce conditions.Eisenhower’s conduct in 1954 marked anotherturning point in the tragic history of Vietnam –
and of the US’s involvement in that tragedy, which
led to extensive sacriﬁces in men, material and, a
decade later, social cohesion. What Eisenhower1Chapter 51AMERICA’S MISSION IN THE WORLD
THE EISENHOWER AND KENNEDY YEARS,1954–63and Dulles refused to accept was that no ﬁrm line
had been drawn against further communist expan-
sion, further erosion of the Western position in
south-east Asia, though they had no wish for the
US to replace colonial France or to exploit South
Vietnam. A halt had been called in Europe and inKorea: now it appeared that the communists werepoised to move south. Although eventually tragic
in their consequences, the Eisenhower–Dulles
reactions should not be judged as inhumane or
dominated by simplistic ideology. Indeed, it was
the communists who deserved their reputation for cruelty. In 1955 and 1956, thousands ofVietnamese ‘traitors’, French sympathisers and
‘landlords’, including many peasants, were killed
by the communists in the North. The entire popu-

lations of Catholic villages ﬂed from the North,
and altogether nearly a million refugees headedsouth when the North Vietnamese state was estab-

lished.Not that Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhuwere paragons of democratic virtue in the South.They imprisoned opposition leaders, rejected anyreal land reforms to aid the peasantry and allowed
corruption to run riot; even so, their authoritar-
ian rule did not compare with North Vietnamese
atrocities during the first years after the new
states’ foundation. Uncertain of their outcome,Diem refused to participate in the Vietnameseelections scheduled for July 1956 under the
Geneva Agreements. He knew that the North
would be coerced to vote solidly in favour of the
communists and that the opposition parties in theSouth would join them to form what might proveto be a majority. It was an election that would
not be free whoever supervised it. Diem’s control
of voting in the South would be far less effective
than the communist control in the North. That
view was shared by Dulles and Eisenhower. It wasDiem who refused to hold the elections, but heknew that the American administration was no
keener to see them take place in 1956 and had
advised on ‘postponement’ to soften the breach
with Geneva.Eisenhower and Dulles were prepared toaccept the 17th parallel as marking the new
boundary of the communist advance in south-east
Asia. They did not encourage Diem to reconquerthe North or even envisage such a conquest;equally they were not prepared to tolerate anycommunist encroachment on the territory of
South Vietnam. They were also obliged to accept
Diem’s rule – there seemed no one else who
could hold the country together. At ﬁrst Diemappeared to be mastering the situation. The year1956 passed and, surprisingly, despite North
Vietnamese protests, there was no renewal of con-
ﬂict between the North and the South. There
were good reasons for this. Ho Chi-minh was
ruthlessly consolidating communist power in the face of ‘traitors’, ‘landlords’ and peasants,while ‘land reform’ was accompanied by thou-
sands of executions. In the south Diem likewise
moved mercilessly against remnants of the 
North Vietnamese Vietminh, who had been leftbehind as a nucleus around whom a communistinsurrection might be constructed. The South
Vietnamese communists, the Vietcong, began
organising in the countryside in 1957, planning
the assassinations of Diem’s village headmen andofﬁcials. But Ho Chi-minh was still holding back.Diem’s authoritarian rule, his ruthlessness and his
corruption aroused opposition not only among
peasants but among all those groups excluded
from power and from a share in the loot. The
Vietcong assassinations soon made themselvesfelt, exciting deep unease throughout thecountry. Murder of government ofﬁcials increased
from 1,200 in 1959 to 4,000 a year by 1961.
Diem’s response was to drive the peasants into
fortiﬁed hamlets, but this proved both ineffectiveand counter-productive, alienating the peasantry,who objected to being placed under military com-
manders and were anyway caught between
Diem’s reprisals during the day and the Vietcong
at night. The US administration failed to appre-
ciate that the Vietcong were not lackeys of thecommunists in the North but were an expandingand powerfully organised army of southern com-
munists engaged in a guerrilla civil war. Clearly
South Vietnamese stability was deteriorating,
though Diem was still in control of the cities andmuch of the countryside of South Vietnam.The position in neighbouring Laos by theclose of the Eisenhower administration (January
1961) was more immediately critical. Ostensibly558WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
a kingdom whose unity was conﬁrmed by theGeneva Agreements of 1954, Laos was torn byregional, tribal and factional strife. The commu-
nist Pathet Lao (Lao National Movement) were
growing stronger in the north. Another army
faction, which was anti-communist, was backedby the Americans. A third group, the so-calledneutralists, tried to maintain at least the sem-

blance of unity by constructing a coalition of all
parties and factions, which would each be left in
de facto control of the regions they held. That
was most unwelcome to the Americans, since thecommunist regions of the country bordered onNorth and South Vietnam and so acted as a
passage for supplies and men along the maze of
jungle trails known as the Ho Chi-minh trail, by
which it took two months to reach the Southfrom the North. The Pathet Lao were also threat-ening to expand their inﬂuence into the strategic
central Plain of Jars, controlling routes between
the capital Vientiane, the royal palace at Luang
Prabang and North Vietnam. This sparsely popu-lated country of some 2.5 million bordered notonly on North and South Vietnam, but also on
China, Burma, Thailand and Cambodia, and so
was a potential cockpit of struggle between more
powerful neighbours.In Washington, Laos appeared to hold the keyto the defence of non-communist south-east Asia.The Eisenhower administration was therefore
determined to maintain a Laotian government in
power untrammelled by communist or neutralist
coalition partners. In neighbouring Cambodia,Prince Sihanouk sustained a skilful balancing actbetween rival factions and no less adroitly main-

tained a precarious neutrality and unity from 1954
to 1970. That was also the aim of the most durable
of the Laotian leaders, Prince Souvanna Phouma,
who tried to establish a neutralist coalition with his brother, the red prince Souphanouvong, who represented the Pathet Lao, and with the
American-supported General Phoumi Nosavan.
He succeeded for a time, but the US backing for
Phoumi and for the Royal Laotian Army ruinedany chances of a neutralist solution. As Americanpenetration increased, so did North Vietnamese
support for the Pathet Lao. But by 1961 the inef-

fectualness and weakness of General Phoumi hadbecome painfully evident. With Soviet and NorthVietnamese support, the communists threatenedto take over the whole of Laos. Eisenhower’s and
Kennedy’s hostility to the neutralist Souvanna
Phouma had removed the one Laotian leader who,
if only for a time, might have held the Pathet Laoin check.SEATO, the south-east Asian collective de-fence treaty, organised by Dulles in September
1954, unlike NATO had no standing armies, nor
had its signatories promised military support to
each other. So, although it was extended to coverthe defence of Cambodia and South Vietnam, itprovided no guarantees of help and proved of
limited value when the US did appeal for military
assistance. The Eisenhower administration also
sent military advisers to South Vietnam and toLaos, yet the Laotian Royal Army never becamean effective ﬁghting force capable of dealing with
the guerrilla tactics of the Pathet Lao. The inﬂux
of Americans and dollars, moreover, corrupted
and undermined the South Vietnamese and theLaotians. American advisers, in any case, sufferedfrom one disability they could not overcome: they
were foreigners, white outsiders. The Pathet Lao
and the Vietcong, for all the violence and disor-
der they brought to their fellow countrymen,
were their own people. An enormous amount offinancial aid was poured into south-east Asia;most of it went to the military or lined the
pockets of corrupt ofﬁcials. What the pattern of
military aid reveals are the priorities of the US in
south-east Asia from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s. By far the largest amount of aid as calcu-lated per head of population was sent to Laos and
South Vietnam during the decade from 1955 to
1963. About half that amount per head went to
Cambodia and the Philippines. Thailand also
received substantial aid whereas in comparison,Indonesia, Burma and Malaysia were granted verylittle assistance.Eisenhower was committing technical, ﬁnancial
and military aid to enable the anti-communist
forces in south-east Asia to defend themselvesagainst the communists. But he was opposed tousing US military forces on the Asian mainland
(except in South Korea). The mighty US Seventh
Fleet with its nuclear weapons was close by. What1AMERICA’S MISSION IN THE WORLD559
if the nuclear threat did not deter the Pathet Laoor the Vietminh, while supplies continued to reachthem from China and the Soviet Union? What if,
despite US aid, the anti-communist groups were
too weak to resist effectively? That dilemma
Eisenhower bequeathed to his successors.In November 1960 the Democratic senator fromMassachusetts won the US presidential election,
defeating the Republican contender Vice-
President Richard Nixon by the narrowest of
margins. Despite fourteen years in Congress,John F. Kennedy had no detailed grasp of theinternational situation, only general attitudes to
world problems: the futility of European colo-
nialism, the need to stand up to communism and
to the Soviet Union, the attractions of issuing acall to the American people to inspire them forthe noble mission of leading the free world.
Kennedy’s electoral theme, that if elected he
would get America moving again, was clothed in
stirring rhetoric reminiscent of Roosevelt’s earlyNew Deal days. His own theme was the ‘NewFrontier’. But detail and concrete undertakings
on the serious issues facing the US, especially at
home, were lacking. That such vagueness over-
took the presidential campaign was hardly surpris-
ing if Kennedy was to have any chance of beatingNixon. Issues of civil rights and social reform didnot divide Republicans from Democrats, but cut
across party lines. Those Republicans who sup-
ported civil rights voted in signiﬁcant numbers 
for the Democratic ticket; the majority of thewhite Democrats in the Southern states, on the other hand, would not all support Kennedy.
But many Southern Democrats regarded the 
vice-presidential candidate, the Texan Lyndon
Johnson, as a conservative, and this helped
Kennedy to retain the Southern Democratic votein eight crucial states, including Texas. Themargins were narrow; indeed, without Texas and
Illinois, where the legendary political boss Mayor
Richard Daley of Chicago was able to marshal the
multi-ethnic vote – black, Polish and German –Kennedy would have lost.The Democrats had to court the votes ofminorities: African Americans, Jews and the dis-
advantaged of all ethnic origins. Kennedy also hadto overcome the widespread prejudice against aCatholic president. So there was not one con-stituency of Democratic voters, but many separ-
ate groups. Apart from seeking to awaken in the
country an appetite for progress after the mild
recession and the Eisenhower years of slowreform, Kennedy turned to the political safety andeasy appeal of outdoing Eisenhower and Nixon as
guardian of the free world. He attacked their
record over Cuba; he would be tougher. And he
discovered an issue that threw the Republicans on
to the defensive, the supposed ‘missile gap’between the Russians and the Americans. Thatthe notion of such a gap, greatly boosted by
Khrushchev’s boasts, turned out to be a myth, in
no way lessened its potency in 1960. In the
famous television debates watched by some 70million Americans, Nixon and Kennedy con-fronted each other. Kennedy looked fresh and
youthful, Nixon sardonic, cynical, even shifty, his
dark jowl insufﬁciently concealed by make-up.
Nixon attempted to contrast his own long exper-ience in government with Kennedy’s inexperi-
ence, but his defence of the Eisenhower record
did not sound very inspiring and Kennedy edged
ahead to victory.Kennedy personiﬁed in looks and vigour theyouthful drive of a new generation, and he and hiswife Jacqueline brought a new eloquence andeasy-going manners to Washington. The handi-
caps arising out of the injury to his back sustained
when the torpedo boat he commanded was sunk
in the Second World War were played down. Heneeded constant painkilling injections and dailydoses of cortisone to restore him to something
approaching normal health, although he contin-
ued to suffer from the progressive anaemia of
Addison’s disease. He pursued pleasure (especially
in the form of attractive young women) but alsoapplied himself to the demands of the presidency;with his unquestionable charm and glamour win-
ning the loyalty of his close advisers in the White
House. The Washington press was also largely on
his side. This was just as well, because Kennedywanted his inﬁdelities hushed up.Middle America before the permissivenessendemic later in the 1960s, would have been
shocked by Kennedy’s insatiable appetite for new560WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
sexual partners, in and out of the White House.His marriage was inevitably placed under extremestrain, and his liaisons with beautiful women even
brought him into contact with the underworld.
After his death, many women claimed to have been
his mistress but, as one of his genuine lovers deli-
cately put it, if all who said that Jack Kennedy hadmade love to them had been telling the truth, he
would not have had the strength to lift a cup of tea.In his domestic policies Kennedy was hardly auda-
cious. He appointed Keynesians as his economicaides, but also invited a conservative ﬁnancier,
Douglas Dillon, to be secretary of the treasury.
Kennedy was aware that his majority in the coun-

try was small and that Congress was in no mood to
pass extensive measures involving large publicexpenditure. Federal aid was provided in selecteddepressed regions where unemployment was espe-

cially high. Increased government expenditure on
defence and a liberalisation of social security bene-

ﬁts provided a stimulus to the economy, but it wasanyway on a cyclical upswing in the summer of1961. In 1962 there followed a Trade Expansion
Act to reduce tariffs, but Congress – with which he
had an unhappy relationship – severely cut
Kennedy’s proposed public works programme.
Nor were his relations with big business helpedwhen he put pressure on the United States SteelCorporation to rescind a price increase. This 
provoked a severe collapse of share prices on the
Stock Exchange. In 1962 Kennedy pressed for-

ward with more resolution on issues of socialreform. He wanted ‘Medicare’ to be granted toretired workers over sixty-ﬁve, funded by social

security, but the powerful medical lobby, objecting
to ‘socialised medicine’, and a Congress worried
about the likely cost, defeated the measure.In 1963 with unemployment remaining high(5.5 per cent) by the standards of that period offull employment, Kennedy boldly proposed a sub-
stantial cut in income tax, only for Congress to
hold the measure up. Before the tragically pre-
mature end of his presidency, Kennedy hadachieved little in the way of giving assistance tothe more deprived sections of American society,
but his focus on housing aid, education and
medical provision pointed to a future when allthese programmes would be enacted. The oneglaring omission was civil rights legislation. Buton this explosive question Kennedy could not
postpone decisive action by instituting modest
and well-intentioned changes by presidential
executive orders. The battle for black equality wasreaching a pitch so intense that all Americabecame involved.Kennedy felt more drawn to global issues, thegreat questions of war and peace and America’s
relations with the rest of the world. In the strug-gle with communism, the free world seemed to beentering a new and dangerous phase. Berlin, Cuba
and Indo-China lay at the heart of the ‘unﬁnished
business’ left over from the Eisenhower adminis-
tration, and all three issues came to the boil withinthe first six months of 1961. A speech byKhrushchev on 6 January 1961, declaring that the
Soviet Union would support what he called
‘national liberation movements’ in the underde-
veloped countries, turned Kennedy’s attention toThird World issues. The ideological subtleties ofKhrushchev’s phrase, which aroused bitter debate
among communists about what exactly he meant,
were not fully grasped in Washington, though the
growing rift between the USSR and China was no
secret.In the White House, Khrushchev’s statementwas interpreted as a challenge: that the commu-
nist world would back insurgency in countries
that so far had resisted communist takeovers. It
was a paradox that, though the West appreciatedthe signiﬁcance of nationalism and those otherelements that determined international and
domestic conﬂicts, communism was still viewed as
a monolithic and undifferentiated threat to the
free world.Kennedy surrounded himself at the WhiteHouse with some of the best brains in thecountry, charged with helping him to formulate
an effective counter to the threat of a continuing
advance by communism, especially in the Third
World. He decided that the US did not have tobalance its budget slavishly, as Eisenhower hadtried to do, and that a boost to public expendi-
ture in the spirit of Keynesian orthodoxy would
help to get the sluggish economy moving, cut1AMERICA’S MISSION IN THE WORLD561
unemployment and expand trade, profits andincomes, so generating more money for theadministration to spend. Kennedy, though cau-
tious about creating large budget deficits,
believed that the US did not lack the necessary
resources to undertake all that was necessary forits security and for its position as the leader of thefree world. The military budget was immediately
increased. The secretary of defence, Robert
McNamara, with his experience of running the
giant Ford Motor Company, was to apply the
latest business techniques to ensure the mosteffective application of funds, both in respect ofprocurement and to identify the right policies to
be pursued. Another adviser was Walt Rostow, an
economics professor who had studied the stages
of economic growth of particular importance to underdeveloped countries. Dean Rusk was secretary of state, and for personal military advice
Kennedy turned to General Maxwell Taylor.
Returning from a fact-ﬁnding mission to South
Vietnam, Rusk and Taylor both advocated in-creasing the American commitment there. ForKennedy, the crucial question was how much.
The military situation had not yet deteriorated to
the point where a massive infusion of American
troops seemed to be essential. Nevertheless, it was
already under discussion.April 1961 was a critical month for the WhiteHouse. Cuba, Vietnam and Laos simultaneously
became the focus of crisis management. On 19
April the invasion by American-backed Cuban
exiles of their homeland had ignominiously failedin the Bay of Pigs; the following day Kennedyordered a review of what military, political and
economic action – overt and covert – it would be
necessary for the US to undertake to prevent the
communist domination of South Vietnam. On
the 26th the American position in neighbouringLaos seemed on the brink of disaster. There waswild talk by the military of air strikes against
North Vietnam and southern China. On 29 April
US troop deployments to Thailand and South
Vietnam were discussed within the administra-tion. Kennedy kept his nerve. Alerts went out toAmerican bases, a modest 100-man increase in
the nearly 700-strong American advisory mission
in South Vietnam was approved and, early inMay, approval for the despatch of a further 400special-forces troops was given. Extra militaryresources were provided, enabling the Vietnamese
army to be expanded from 150,000 to 170,000
troops. Finally, US troops were stationed in
Thailand.Later that same May the panic in the WhiteHouse over Laos subsided. America’s threatening
posture seemed to have been effective in re-
straining the Chinese and North Vietnamese.
Khrushchev, too, had been alarmed and wanted
to quieten things down. The White House’sprimary concern was once again Vietnam.Doubts had surfaced about the strongman ofSouth Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem. He and his
brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, and his formidable sister-
in-law Madame Nhu, were heading a governmentpervaded by corruption, and internal oppositionwas growing; the lack of morale among the South
Vietnamese army was also only too evident.
Might not American training, advice and leader-
ship be the best way to stiffen their resolve? Butthis would entail a considerable increase to theUS military presence in South Vietnam. By the
autumn of 1961 General Taylor had recom-
mended to the president the despatch of 8,000
US combat soldiers; in a memorandum the joint
chiefs of staff had estimated that 40,000 UStroops would ‘clean up the Vietcong threat’ andthat if the North Vietnamese and Chinese inter-
vened another 128,000 would be sufﬁcient to
repel them. The idea of punishing North
Vietnamese intervention and discouraging furtherincursions by bombing North Vietnam had alsobeen raised. All these were proposals to Ameri-
canise the conflict in Vietnam. Vice-President
Johnson had already provided the justification 
for this after returning from a fact-ﬁnding mission
the previous spring: he had advised the presidentthat the battle against communism had to betaken up in south-east Asia or the US would lose
the Paciﬁc and have to defend its own shores.
But, even faced with such exaggerated catastro-
phe scenarios, Kennedy resisted sending substan-tial numbers of US servicemen. He was scepticalwhether a few thousand US troops would make
the crucial difference to the military situation.
Nevertheless, by October 1963, shortly before his562WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
assassination, his administration had already sent more than 16,000 men to South Vietnam.The Geneva Agreements were dead, as the US
responded militarily to increasing Vietcong activ-
ity in the South.More important than the numbers, which weresmall compared with Johnson’s eventual decisionto ﬁght an all-out war employing half a million
US combat troops, was the commitment the 
US made to South Vietnam during the Kennedy
presidency and the decisions that were taken
about the basic strategy needed to prevent South Vietnam from falling to the communists.Kennedy had expressed doubts at times about the
intrinsic importance of Vietnam; on other occa-
sions he subscribed to the notion that its loss
would entail the loss of southern Asia.Although Kennedy frequently showed a bettersense of proportion than some of his advisers
about the dangers of escalation following the
despatch of US troops, he never departed from
his policy of increasing the US commitment asmuch as he judged necessary to defeat theVietcong. His reasoning was political and global:
political because after agreeing to the neutralising
of Laos and the Cuban Bay of Pigs disaster, he
could not afford to seem in retreat again; global
because he accepted what he interpreted as thecommunist challenge to the free world, whichhad now shifted to a struggle for the Third
World. He ignored the advice he received from
General de Gaulle in the summer of 1961 not to
get bogged down in an interminable war in Indo-China as the French had been and he was unde-terred by the refusal of his principal ally, Britain,
to join the US military effort, as it had once done
to halt communist aggression in Korea. Vietnam
became America’s ﬁght, with relatively little help
from America’s Pacific allies, Thailand, SouthKorea, Australia and the Philippines. It was thekind of struggle, moreover, for which the
Eisenhower military doctrine of meeting any
communist aggression with massive nuclear retal-
iation against Moscow or Beijing was extraordi-narily ill-suited, as Eisenhower had alreadydiscovered in Laos.The new military concept suitable for ThirdWorld struggles with communism was workedout mainly by Walt Rostow, a professor of eco-nomics, General Taylor and McNamara. At theheart of it was the notion of ﬂexible response.
Insurgency and guerrilla tactics would be met by
counter-insurgency and specially trained units –
the Green Berets. The Vietcong would be soughtout and destroyed in their hideouts in the coun-tryside and jungles. Combat troops would meet
the enemy troops in just sufﬁcient strength to
defeat them. This would enable the US to resist
force by counter-force in situations and over con-
ﬂicts that, in themselves, could not possibly beregarded as important enough to risk the destruc-tion of the US in a nuclear exchange with the
Soviet Union. Only in defence of Western Europe
and over the question of Berlin did the US
threaten to use nuclear missiles. But even thisdetermination was doubted by de Gaulle, whodeveloped France’s own nuclear missile capacity,
and by the British who, though they later decided
to rely on American missiles sold to Britain, also
maintained their own national deterrent.In Vietnam, Kennedy’s acceptance of the doc-trine of flexible response meant that the US
would be drawn into an ever increasing commit-
ment. This was foreseen by intelligence reports
reaching Washington which pointed out that
neither bombing the North nor increasing thelevel of American combat troops in Vietnamwould dissuade the North from matching every
increase. The US would be setting out on a war
of attrition without any foreseeable end. Or,
rather, it would be ended ﬁrst by the US, whenthe American people and Congress came to sayno to any further resources, any further loss of
American lives.Kennedy, himself, at one time asked what wasso important about Vietnam, and Secretary of
State Dean Rusk, more of a hawk than a dove,wondered how the Americans could win a war inSouth Vietnam which the South Vietnamese
themselves were mishandling and even losing. For
Kennedy the struggle was not about Vietnam
alone but about American leadership, about theperception of America’s determination to defendthe free world, whatever the cost. This was
America’s mission in the world. In his election
campaign, in his inaugural and subsequent1AMERICA’S MISSION IN THE WORLD563
addresses to the American people, Kennedyexhorted America to live up to its ideals. But thisexhortation to play a world role had its dangers.
In his televised debate with Nixon, Kennedy
declaimed, ‘In the election of 1860, Abraham
Lincoln said the question was whether this nationcould exist half slave or half free. In the electionof 1960 ... the question is whether the world will

exist half slave or half free’, rhetoric that raised
American expectations to such a pitch and so
over-emphasised US power that withdrawal or
defeat anywhere in the world ceased to be accept-able. The US presidency thus became the victimof its own projection of America invincible, of
America the righter of moral wrongs anywhere in
the world (provided they were perpetrated by
communists). If Americans could reach themoon, they would surely be able to defeat asecond-class, Third World country. The prospec-
tive disillusionment of the American people
should it turn out that they had been misled, and
that defeat in war had to be accepted, hauntedsuccessive presidents. Indeed, the gap betweenexpectation and reality was to shatter the next
three presidents: Johnson over Vietnam, Nixon
over Watergate and Carter over the American
hostages in Iran.In October 1963 Kennedy was optimisticallyplanning to begin withdrawing the 16,000Americans from Vietnam, but he would not have
allowed a communist victory either. While bril-
liant men and their theories pushed him forward,
his own steadier judgement held him back. Hewas inclined to ambivalence, ﬁrst going along
with the advice of experts, but then cautiously
scaling their recommendations down. The appli-
cation of this ambivalence to his dealings with
Cuba led to a humiliating defeat, an early per-
sonal disaster puncturing his electoral rhetoric.The Eisenhower administration had bequeathedthe ‘unﬁnished business’ of Cuba to the incom-
ing president and his advisers. Not only had
Castro nationalised American businesses andtaken over the US oil reﬁneries but his country’slinks with the Soviet Union were becoming
closer. By 1962 he had turned Cuba into a one-
party communist state. But, even as he acceptedSoviet help, Castro was at heart a Latin Americannationalist, unwilling simply to become a Russianpawn in the Cold War.The problem Kennedy faced was whether totolerate the continued presence of Castro or to
follow through plans initiated by Eisenhower to use Cuban exiles trained in Guatemala for aninvasion of the island to overthrow its leader.
Kennedy was urged by some advisers to go ahead
with the invasion and to provide it with air
support. He was told that many Cubans on the
island were only waiting to be rallied againstCastro. Others, including the sagacious SenatorFulbright, warned the president against foreign
adventures. Kennedy struck a hopeless middle
course, permitting the invasion of Cuba to pro-
ceed while trying to disguise American involve-ment. He accordingly limited the air support toexiled pilots ﬂying American-procured planes and
refused to sanction any direct US participation in
the air or on land.The Bay of Pigs landing, launched on 17 April1961 by the Cuban exiles, became for the admin-istration and for the president personally, a humil-
iating ﬁasco. At least Kennedy kept his head when
on 18 and 19 April 1961 the exiles were pinned
down by Castro’s troops on the beach. By then
it was becoming clear that the invasion was failingand that only US intervention could retrieve it.Khrushchev, to rub salt into the wound, declared
that the Soviet Union would defend Cuba, but
Kennedy did not raise the ante further. The
Cuban exiles were left to their fate; more than athousand survivors were rounded up and impris-oned by Castro.Kennedy did not try to evade personal respon-sibility. He tried all the harder now to retrieve
America’s good name by pushing ahead with the
Alliance for Progress, which he had already pro-claimed in March 1961. This represented thepositive side of US policy, an effort to transform
Latin America, to solve its serious social and polit-
ical problems, eradicating destitution over the
next decade and so heading off communist revo-lutions. Covert action against Cuba meanwhiletook dark and bizarre forms, with the Central
Intelligence Agency hatching various plots to
assassinate Castro by such ingenious devices as a564WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
poisoned cigar or dropping pills into his drink. InOctober 1962 Cuba would be in the news againin the most serious Cold War crisis since the
Berlin blockade of 1948–9.The Alliance for Progress was the positiveaspect of America’s world mission. It promised$20 billion of US aid for development, which was to be matched by $80 billion from Latin
American sources over the next decade. The lever
of US partnership and of ﬁnancial and technical
assistance was intended not only to develop Latin
American trade and production so that thegrowth of wealth would outpace the growth ofpopulation, but also to bring about basic political
and democratic constitutional change and des-
perately necessary agrarian reform. Latin America
would be turned from the path of revolution toone of evolution and human betterment. Thethreatened advance of authoritarian socialism pro-
vided the spur, as it had done in Europe, where
it had prompted Marshall Aid, yet the presence of
a genuinely humanitarian motivation should notbe overlooked. Although the Alliance createdsome spectacular developments, it failed in its
basic purpose of transforming Latin America
socially and politically. It worsened rather than
narrowed the gap between the rich and poor, as
funds were channelled to large enterprises alreadyowned by foreign corporations or by wealthyindigenous elites. Authoritarian rulers further
misappropriated large amounts of money. Vested
interests naturally resisted any transfer of their
wealth and power to the poor and, when facedwith a choice of supporting them or allowingthem to fall in the face of radical socialist revolu-
tions, the US provided them with military aid.
This strengthened military leaders and so weak-
ened further the prospects for democracy. Raised
expectations came up against corruption andrepression. Latin America was thus heading forfurther instability and violent revolution, and not
for the ‘peaceful revolution’ Kennedy had envis-
aged (Part XIV).Kennedy’s failure in Cuba did not seem todiminish his appeal at home. A Gallup poll takensoon after the Bay of Pigs showed his popularity
soaring to an unprecedented 83 per cent approval
rating. The American people rallied to their presi-dent, but this support even in the face of a ﬁascoshowed something more significant: that theytrusted their administration and were looking for
strong leadership, for government to get things
done and to solve the nation’s manifold problems.Kennedy was not at ease when he metKhrushchev in Vienna during the summer of1961. It was to be a low-key meeting, each leader
gauging the mettle of the other. Kennedy had
Laos on his mind. Khrushchev wanted to restrain
the North Vietnamese and Chinese in order not
to provoke strong US reactions. For reasons oftheir own the Chinese were also ready to take alonger-term view and this made possible the con-
vening of a second Geneva Conference in May
1961, which, after fourteen months of tedious
negotiations, agreed in July 1962 to ‘neutralise’Laos, with a coalition of all parties in a royal gov-ernment presided over by Prince Souvanna
Phouma. It was papering over the cracks. None
of the parties concerned in Laos or outside had
actually abandoned their ambitions to dominatethe country.Another crisis loomed over the status of WestBerlin. The West’s determination to maintain its
position in the city deep in the Soviet orbit had
become a powerful symbol of resistance to any
attempted Russian encroachments by force ordiplomacy. Khrushchev’s threat to sign a peacetreaty with the German Democratic Republic the
Soviets had created, thus handing over control of
access to a communist regime which the West
refused to recognise, was an unacceptable solu-tion as far as the NATO powers, including theUS, were concerned. But Khrushchev could
create such a crisis by ostensibly giving up Soviet
responsibility for the air and land routes and
handing these to the DDR. At their Vienna
meeting on 3 and 4 June 1961, Kennedy madeit clear that the West would resist by all means atits disposal any unilateral Soviet moves and
warned Khrushchev against ‘miscalculation’. The
two leaders also clashed on the issue of the Third
World.Unknown to the West, Khrushchev had hisown problems with his Kremlin colleagues in the
Praesidium. No Soviet leader after Stalin’s death
had enjoyed the old dictator’s undisputed power.1AMERICA’S MISSION IN THE WORLD565
For the time being Khrushchev was accepted asprimus inter pares, but Soviet leadership was ulti-mately a collective affair. There were hardliners
dissatisﬁed with Khrushchev’s efforts to achieve
detente. Others criticised his erratic course and
his opportunism. The ideologues wanted topursue a ‘pure’ Marxism–Leninism believing thatthe revolutionary cause could be led only by the
proletariat. Khrushchev was more of a realist,
ready to take advantage of developments that
weakened the West and which in the longer term
would further the Soviet Union’s global interests.In the Stalin era Third World communist partieshad been instructed to take up the revolutionary
struggle not only against the colonial imperialists,
but also against the ‘national-bourgeois lackeys’.
But the anti-colonial struggle in the Third Worldwas ﬁercely nationalist, led and supported by anindigenous, educated middle class, rather than by
peasants or workers. While Third World radicals
included active groups who believed in the need
for socialist or even communist transformations ofsociety and in centrally planned economies tobreak existing feudal elites, they were not in
favour of exchanging a dependency on the West
for a dependency on the East. The nationalists
were in any case broad coalitions united only by
a wish to get rid of their country’s colonial status.In Egypt, they were led by army ofﬁcers; else-where they were led by civilian revolutionaries.Khrushchev had thrown Russian supportbehind President Nasser of Egypt in 1955. The
Soviet Union began to dispense its own ﬁnancialand military aid programme to win friends andinﬂuence nations. It was on a smaller scale than
the American programme, but was carefully
applied where it seemed to serve Russian interests
best. Egypt and India received most aid; region-
ally, the Middle East was given priority, relativelylittle going to Latin America; the sums devotedto military aid were more than twice as large as
those earmarked for economic credits. Despite
the views of the purists, Khrushchev was prepared
to back anti-colonial movements, even if theyincluded bourgeois elements. This is what hemeant when he offered to help ‘national libera-tion movements’.At Vienna, Khrushchev reafﬁrmed his supportfor ‘national liberation’ struggles, accusing the
US of representing the status quo and of inter-
vening to support it. Kennedy countered with theargument that the balance of power between thecommunist and non-communist worlds should be
preserved. There was thus no meeting of minds.
Kennedy returned to the US and in July that year
increased the defence budget and the strength of
the armed forces.Khrushchev chose another method of breakingthe Berlin deadlock, which was also an infraction
of treaty agreements, but did not threaten
Western rights in West Berlin. Walter Ulbricht,
the East German communist leader, had beenpressing for effective action to stop the everincreasing ﬂow of East German citizens across the
open Berlin frontier to the West. The ﬂow of
refugees had reached such proportions that the
stability of the East German state was endan-
gered. On 13 August 1961, barbed wire waserected along the frontier right across Berlin, later
replaced by the Wall, complete with armed guard
towers. East Berlin and the German Democratic
Republic were turned into a gigantic prison. The
West protested but did not attempt to remove theWall by force. It was another compromise, butone that was regarded as ending the Berlin crisis.
As the eventful year of 1961 drew to its close, the
conclusion of a Soviet peace treaty with the DDR
was once more postponed; no date was now setfor its conclusion.Khrushchev’s world policies had brought theSoviet Union few concrete beneﬁts. The dispute
with China was growing; over Berlin, Khrushchev
had had to abandon his stand; and even the
success of Soviet missile development was clearlybeing overtaken by the dynamic policies of the Kennedy administration. Khrushchev badly
needed a dramatic coup, or at least the appear-
ance of one. That need probably inspired the bold
Soviet initiative that was to lead to the Cubanmissile crisis.566WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
On Wednesday, 24 October 1962, some 500 milesfrom the shores of Cuba, two Soviet merchant ves-

sels, the Gagarinand Komiles, escorted by Sovietsubmarines, were heading for the Caribbeanisland. At 10.15 a.m. precisely they encounteredpatrolling US warships. The Essexhad orders tosink the Soviet submarine escorts if they should
refuse to surface when challenged. Two days earlier
President Kennedy had announced a naval block-

ade of Cuba after the discovery of Soviet missilesites on the island. On the US mainland, aircraftarmed with nuclear weapons were on maximum
alert. Special strike forces were readied for an inva-

sion of Cuba. The world held its breath. Was
civilised life on the brink of destruction, on thethreshold of a nuclear holocaust? What if the WhiteHouse or the Kremlin in this dreadful trial of
strength miscalculated?That Wednesday morning the Soviet shipshalted. The news was ﬂashed to the White House.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk, with evident relief,drew his own conclusion: ‘We’re eyeball toeyeball, and I think the other fellow just blinked.’
People all over the world, anxiously watching
their television sets, were no less relieved: the
dramatic crisis was over. Actually it was not. Thereally serious danger of conﬂict occurred threedays later. On Saturday, 27 October Kennedy
only just drew back from ordering an air strike 
on the Cuban missile sites, to be followed by an
invasion of the island. But when on Sundaymorning, 28 October, the White House receivedthe news from Moscow that Khrushchev hadagreed to withdraw the missiles, the crisis really
was over.Kennedy and his advisers in the White Houseand Khrushchev in the Kremlin acted in theknowledge that one false step could lead to a
nuclear exchange and the end of civilisation. The
strains on the two men were enormous. Neither
wanted to risk starting a nuclear holocaust. The
conﬂict was not exactly what the public thoughtit was about. By placing intermediate and inter-continental missiles with nuclear warheads just
ninety miles off the coast of Florida, the Soviet
Union would have given the impression that the
military threat to the US had significantlyincreased. It was more a question of propagandaand prestige, of positioning in the global Cold
War. The conﬂict turned on the Russian claim to
an equal place in the world, to the right to
compete with the US for inﬂuence anywhere in
the Third World, in regions of Asia not undercommunist control, and in Latin America. Themere existence of Castro’s Cuba was, from an
American point of view, a breach of the Monroe
Doctrine. After the humiliation of the Bay of Pigs
in the previous year, to accept tacitly the estab-lishment of a Soviet military base on the islandwas unthinkable. It would raise doubts whether
the US, when faced with an ultimate showdown,
would have the toughness to meet resolutely and
effectively such a communist challenge. If the USfailed on its own doorstep, what reliance could1Chapter 52ON THE BRINK OF A NUCLEARHOLOCAUSTTHE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, OCTOBER 1962there be placed on American readiness to defendWestern interests in Europe or the Middle Eastor Asia? That is how the thinking ran in
Washington during the autumn of 1962. For
Kennedy, another defeat over Cuba would have
been calamitous domestically to his standing aspresident. His opponents would have gone totown, charging him with being soft on commu-
nism. The stakes were high and Kennedy was fully
aware of the implications.From a purely military point of view Kennedyagreed with his secretary of defence RobertMcNamara that missiles placed in Cuba did notsigniﬁcantly add to a Soviet threat. Just a few
months earlier, in March 1962, he had concluded
that there was not much difference between mis-

siles stationed in the American hemisphere andthose positioned 5,000 miles away. During theOctober crisis later that year McNamara applied
cold logic in analysing what the effect of having
missiles in Cuba would be. Should the Soviets ﬁre

their limited number of Cuban missiles ﬁrst, they
would reach the US beforeany missiles from theSoviet Union and so act as a warning, leading to
massive retaliation by the US, with its 1,685
nuclear warheads obliterating much of the Soviet
Union. The injury to the USSR would be mega-

times greater than the injury that forty-two Cuban-based nuclear weapons could inﬂict on the US.
Kennedy had not been too greatly alarmed bySoviet support for Castro before September 1962.
This did not mean he was soft on communism or
prepared to tolerate a communist state in theWestern hemisphere. In fact, the overthrow ofCastro became an obsession. The ill-advised and
in the end ineffectual policies pursued before and
after the Cuban missile crisis were revealed only
when Central Intelligence Agency documents
were published in 1975 by the US Senate underthe title Alleged Assassination Plots InvolvingForeign Leaders. A counter-insurgency expert,General Edward Lansdale, had been instructed by
Kennedy to recommend actions that would lead
to Castro’s overthrow. In December 1961 withthe backing of the president and his brotherRobert Kennedy, the attorney-general, Operation
Mongoose was launched. The orders read, ‘No
time, money, effort – or manpower is to be spared. We are at war with Cuba.’ With assassina-tion seen as a legitimate option, the CIA hatchedplots to ‘knock off Castro’. Every effort was 
made to isolate Cuba politically and economically;
sabotage teams inﬁltrated the island early in 1962
to destroy strategic targets, including bridges and vital communications, oil reﬁneries and sugarmills; there was even a plan to poison turkeys.
Another crazy scheme, never carried out, was to
‘incapacitate’ with poisonous chemicals the farm-
ers collecting the sugar harvest or, alternatively, to
poison the sugar being sent to Russia in order toprovoke a breach between the Soviet Union andCuba. Intelligence was collected.The objective of all this was to create havocand dissatisfaction in Cuba and so to incite a
popular uprising. Consideration was given to thepossibility that a revolt could then be supportedby American armed forces, to avoid another Bay
of Pigs ﬁasco. The results of so much activity were
disappointing. Early in October 1962, a few days
before the missile crisis, Robert Kennedy passedon new instructions from the president to esca-late Mongoose, to increase the number of sabo-
tage missions – results had to be achieved. That
Castro should in the face of so much hostility
have become paranoid himself is, therefore,
understandable. He appealed to Moscow for help,believing an American invasion to be imminent.Khrushchev viewed this as a threat and an oppor-
tunity. Publicly he declared that the Monroe
Doctrine had ‘died a natural death’.Little thought had been given in Washingtonto the likely reaction in the Kremlin to the threatsagainst Cuba. Khrushchev was a curious mixture
of dreamer and realist, cunning, trusting in his
own abilities and his superior gamesmanship,
ready to gamble on the inferior capacity of his
opponent to respond. The US, he had concludedin the spring of 1962, was becoming too self-conﬁdent and arrogant, and needed to be check-
ed. Robert McNamara and other members of 
the administration had been openly boasting of
America’s growing superiority in nuclear strengthand its ability to deliver it and crush the SovietUnion. In March 1962 the Saturday Evening Postreported Kennedy referring to the possibility that
circumstances could arise that might lead to a US568WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
ﬁrst strike against the Soviet Union. Khrushchevknew that the Soviet Union was, indeed, hope-lessly inferior in nuclear missile strength, that it
was ringed by nuclear bases from Turkey to
Western Europe and that American superiority
placed him in a poor bargaining position overBerlin and other areas of conﬂict. Bluff was hisanswer. The Soviet Union would act like a super-
power until it could catch up. Khrushchev had
boasted that the march of communism in the
world could not be stopped. Cuba was a test. The
Soviet Union must be seen to stand by its onlyally in the Americas. ‘Coexistence’ did not meansoftness, as Mao was claiming.The crisis had its roots in April and May 1962.Khrushchev conceived of a ‘brilliant’ stroke. He
would move missiles into Cuba. They would actas a deterrent, protect Cuba from invasion andhelp to even up the balance of power. Khrushchev
rejected the misgivings of Foreign Minister
Gromyko and the wily old Armenian Bolshevik
Mikoyan. On 24 May the Praesidium approvedthe plan. Khrushchev was playing for high stakes,at home and internationally.Liberalisation in Moscow and the open accessto US archives make it possible to reconstruct
what went on in the White House and the
Kremlin during the crisis. That the Soviet Unionin 1962 was engaged in arming Cuba was nosecret. The ships carrying missiles in their holds
and under tarpaulins could not be made invisible
on the high seas. The high-ﬂying U-2 planes were
able to spy on the island and photograph withgreat accuracy and detail what was going on. On29 August a spy plane took pictures of Soviet tech-
nicians constructing a SAM (surface-to-air missile)
launching pad. Four days later, Washington being
a leaky place, a Republican senator raised the pos-
sibility that the Soviets might be stationing inCuba short-range and intermediate missiles with amaximum range of 2,500 miles. That would
enable them to reach Washington, New York and
other US cities. Both Houses of Congress now
passed resolutions authorising military interven-tion should that prove necessary. Kennedy had todo something, even though SAM missiles were
clearly defensive, but he did not wish to provoke a
crisis needlessly. He and most of his advisers didnot think it at all likely that Khrushchev would befoolhardy enough to introduce offensive long-range nuclear missiles. Still, public apprehension
and the demand for action required a weighty pro-
nouncement. It came on 12 September. Kennedy
held a news conference and declared that the USwould do ‘whatever must be done’ to protect itssecurity and that of its allies if any offensive base
was established by the Soviet Union in the
Western hemisphere.A crisis now became inevitable. How farKennedy had changed his mind about the mili-tary signiﬁcance of Soviet missiles in Cuba is notclear. What is certain is that the political fallout
in the US would have been devastating had the
administration just tacitly accepted a Soviet
missile base in Cuba. Kennedy’s mistake had beento trust Khrushchev. The warning came too late.Long- and medium-range missiles were already
on the island and more nuclear missiles were 
on the way. Khrushchev, in his ignorance of the
US political climate, had grossly miscalculated the likely reaction of the president. With the congressional elections looming, Khrushchev
thought that Kennedy would hide the fact that
missile bases were being constructed in Cuba if
he found out about them. Such a cover-up was
possible in the Soviet Union but not in the US,where political opponents and a free press couldnot be silenced.Kennedy could not afford another defeat overCuba. He had allowed the Russians to send large
quantities of military equipment to Cuba after theBay of Pigs and could do little to counterKhrushchev’s boast of defending Cuba. But he
could not allow his position to be publicly under-
mined any further. He could not, of course, reveal
his own secret plans to get rid of Castro;
Operation Mongoose would have given the lie toassertions that he was soft on communism, butpublic knowledge would have caused an inter-
national outcry.During the crisis itself credit must go toKennedy for keeping options open and for notreacting in haste. He received much conﬂictingadvice. Even his brother Robert Kennedy, the
attorney-general, had swung from hawkish to
dovish moods during the crisis days. Most of the1ON THE BRINK OF A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST569
military advice was for getting on with the joband striking at Cuba; the military were chaﬁng atthe bit. Perhaps in the end there was one good
thing that came out of the previous year’s Bay of
Pigs disaster: Kennedy was not going to be
pushed again and his innate conservatism andcaution prevailed. After the crisis was past, heshowed commendable restraint in not trying to
exult.The drama of the days of crisis and con-frontation can now be brieﬂy told. On 14 October
1962, a U-2 spy plane took photographs of pos-sible missile construction sites. Interpretation ofthese photographs was not easy, but assistance
was received from an unlikely source, from Oleg
Penkovsky, a Soviet spy then in Moscow, who
was passing information to Western intelligenceservices. (He was later caught and executed bythe Russians.) The president was ﬁrst shown the
photographs, now interpreted on the morning of
16 October. They provided incontrovertible evi-
dence, he was told, that the Russians were con-structing offensive missile bases. That was the startof the emergency; the White House, where sus-
picions had been aroused, was nevertheless sur-
prised by the incontrovertible facts. The US
experts on the USSR, on whose advice Kennedy
had relied, were taken unawares. Indeed, beforeSeptember, Washington’s worries had beenfocused on Soviet threats against West Berlin
rather than Cuba; in the previous year Washington
had even feared it might be faced with having to
abandon Berlin to the Russians or go to war.The thirteen days of crisis that followed thediscovery of the sites were punctuated by intense
debates among the inner circle of advisers. They
were constituted as the Executive Committee of
the National Security Council, or Ex. Comm. for
short. From the ﬁrst meeting on 16 October untilthe end of the crisis the assumption was that theUS would get the missiles out of Cuba by diplo-
macy or force, whatever the risk. Throughout
those tense days there were continuing rounds of
freewheeling discussion: all possible options wereexamined. These ranged from what was referredto as a ‘surgical air strike’ against the missile sites,
to proposals for a naval blockade, an air strike on
the missile bases and an all-out invasion of Cuba.The military favoured an air strike on the missilebases. Robert Kennedy, who also at ﬁrst had sug-gested creating a pretext for attacking Cuba, later
opposed this option; he then likened such a sur-
prise raid to the sneak Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor in 1941.Yet Kennedy and his advisers felt themselves tobe under inexorable pressure of time. A decision
would have to be reached. If allowed to continue
undisturbed, US intelligence calculated, the
Russians would complete the installation of the
missiles and be able to arm them with nuclearwarheads in fourteen days. In the end a majorityof Ex. Comm. favoured the naval blockade as a
ﬁrst step. The ﬁnal decision could be made only
by the president. By 21 October Kennedy came
down in favour of the blockade option. Up to thispoint the proof of the installation of missiles hadbeen kept a secret in Washington, as had the dis-
cussions in the White House about how best to
deal with it. The missiles would soon be ready for
ﬁring: decisions had to be reached. No one inWashington knew whether they were equippedwith nuclear warheads, but it was thought safer
to presume that some warheads had already
reached Cuba. In fact, Soviet archives later
revealed that some forty-two nuclear warheads
were on the island but under exclusive Sovietcontrol. Khrushchev did not allow Castro to havehis ﬁnger on the trigger. An argument against an
air strike was that possibly not all the missile sites
had been located.On the next day, 22 October, the presidentdelivered a sombre television broadcast to theAmerican people at 7 p.m. He announced his
decision to impose a blockade around Cuba as an
initialstep and coupled it with the demand thatthe missiles had to be removed. He also explicitly
warned the Russians not to attempt a counter-move against West Berlin. The broadcast was verydramatic. He warned that Soviet nuclear missiles
and bombers based on Cuba were ‘an explicit
threat to the peace and security of all the
Americas’, and added that the Soviet Union hadno need of missile sites outside the Soviet Union.Finally, he accused the Soviet leaders of deliber-
ate lying when they had assured him that no
offensive weapons would be based on Cuba. That570WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
they had been lying was true. The missile threatappeared real enough. No wonder the Americanpeople felt threatened when maps appeared with
arcs showing that missiles launched in Cuba could
reach most of the US. The Soviet gamble was pre-
sented as pointing a dagger to the heart ofAmerica.Kennedy’s first countermove was the navalblockade, proclaimed on 23 October after OAS
approval. This less aggressive option was in line
with the advice given by the British ambassador
in Washington, David Ormsby-Gore, a closefriend of the Kennedys. Ormsby-Gore, moreover,contributed the suggestion that the line of block-
ade be set up not 800 miles, but 500 miles from
Cuba, so as to give the Kremlin more time for
reflection. Thus the die was cast. US forces,including B-52 bombers armed with nuclearweapons, were put on alert. How would the
Russians react now?On 24 October, as has already been related,two Soviet ships reached the blockade and halted.During the next ﬁve days, oil tankers and ‘inof-fensive’ Soviet vessels were allowed through. The
crisis, however, was far from over. The missile
sites in Cuba were still being feverishly prepared.
Kennedy insisted that they should be dismantled.
A new crisis loomed. Soviet intentions were dan-gerously unclear in Washington.The missiles had been placed in Cuba to deter.Khrushchev was determined to defend Cuba; like
Castro, he expected the Americans to invade
unless effectively deterred. But deterrence wasbluff. The long-range missiles would not havebeen ﬁred. The defence of Cuba was not worth
the destruction of the USSR.On 25 October at the United Nations AdlaiStevenson worsted the Soviet delegate with dra-
matic proof of Russia’s deception, and televisionpictures of the UN confrontation were shown all over the Western world. The following day,
the possibility of a deal was ﬁrst suggested by the
Soviet side. Alexander Fomin, counsellor at the
Soviet Embassy but, according to US intelligenceresources, in reality a KGB colonel, asked JohnScali, a journalist, to lunch with him at the
Occidental, a restaurant close to the White House
whose well-known advertisement ran, ‘wherestatesmen dine’. The agent outlined the deal: ifthe US undertook not to invade Cuba now orlater, then the Russian missiles would be
removed. When Secretary of State Rusk was told,
he accompanied Scali to the White House to
inform the president. That same evening a longrambling letter from Khrushchev, confused butfriendly in tone, reached the White House. The
most important passages suggested that the
Soviet Union would not carry arms to Cuba if 
the president would give an assurance that the 
US would not attack Cuba. It was much vaguerthan Fomin’s proposal, but it likewise seemed to indicate the beginnings of a deal. Scali was
instructed to meet Fomin again and to assure him
that the US saw possibilities in the deal but that
there was little time left. To the present day wedo not know whether Fomin was acting on hisown initiative, but in Washington his proposal
was regarded as emanating from the Kremlin. It
lent more substance to Khrushchev’s own vague
proposals.The following day, Saturday, 27 October,another letter was received from Khrushchev,
sharper and more deﬁnite. This time he undertook
to remove the offensive missiles from Cuba, but
he added that to emphasise equality he required
the removal of American missiles from Turkey. Itwas a face-saving device and nothing illustrates themilitary unreality better than the fact that the US
regarded the old Jupiter missiles in Turkey as use-
less anyway and had wanted to remove them in
1961. But now they could not openly agree with-out appearing to give Khrushchev a justiﬁcationfor having sent missiles to Cuba.As Kennedy and his advisers were debatinghow to react to Khrushchev’s two letters, the
news reached the White House that a U-2 plane
over Cuba had been shot down by a surface-to-air missile, killing the pilot. The atmosphereentirely changed. It was mistakenly assumed that
this was a deliberate Soviet escalation. In fact, the
Soviet commanders in Cuba had acted on their
own initiative, stretching the authority to defendthemselves. The US chiefs of staff, who had beenurging stronger action than a naval blockade, now
pressed for an air strike and the launching of an
invasion. Kennedy, too, asked how U-2 planes1ON THE BRINK OF A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST571
could any longer be sent to observe what wasgoing on if the pilots’ lives were thereby exposedto danger. ‘We are now in an entirely new ball
game.’The ﬁnal escalation of the crisis appears to havebeen prompted by the kind of accident Kennedyhad always feared could lead to fatal miscalcula-tion. Another U-2 plane had accidentally strayed
into Soviet airspace over Siberia and had been
damaged by a missile (it made it back to its base
in the US). But the next ‘accident’ might prove
more serious and the chances of it happeningwould increase the longer the crisis lasted.It is significant that Khrushchev avoidedmaking any public military preparations in the
Soviet Union, though in fact the Soviet armed
forces had been placed in full preparedness.Khrushchev was anxious not to raise the temper-ature further. Then news reached the Kremlin
that an American U-2 plane had been shot down
over Cuba. Khrushchev rightly feared that the
confrontation could slip out of his and Kennedy’scontrol.In the White House, meanwhile, Kennedy cau-tiously pulled back from ordering immediate
armed action against Cuba and the Soviet instal-
lations. Everything was to be thought through
again and another message conveyed to theKremlin. Kennedy was rightly convinced that theRussians did not want to ﬁght any more than the
Americans. The president asked his brother to
arrange an immediate meeting with the Soviet
ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin. Dobrynin has-
tened to the Justice Department within half anhour of receiving the telephone call. Though
Robert Kennedy later denied it, the message he
gave the ambassador was practically an ultima-
tum. He told Dobrynin that by the following day,
Sunday, the Soviet Union would have to agree toremove the bases and missiles or the US wouldremove them. That was the stick. The carrot was
that the Jupiter missiles would be removed from
Turkey later, but not under Soviet threat. On the
suggestion of McGeorge Bundy, national securityadviser, no reply was sent to Khrushchev’s secondmessage; it was simply ignored. Instead, the pro-
posal contained in the ﬁrst was accepted: if the
Soviets removed their missiles, the US wouldundertake not to invade Cuba. These representedthe maximum concessions the president waswilling to make.That same Saturday evening, after RobertKennedy returned to the White House, there was
considerable gloom. Would Khrushchev yield?The president ordered the military to be ready toinvade Cuba. The decision about an air strike was
to be reviewed on Sunday. As everyone dispersed
that Saturday night they wondered whether they
would wake to a peaceful morning. In Moscow
Khrushchev was spending Saturday night in hisdacha. Kennedy’s reply reached him there onSunday morning, 28 October. He summoned the
Praesidium, which agreed to issue a positive
response to be broadcast immediately, since every
minute’s delay was considered to be dangerous.Later that morning, the State Departmentreceived the message over Radio Moscow that
Khrushchev had accepted the US proposals. The
‘offensive’ missiles would be removed under UN
supervision in exchange for the American under-taking not to invade Cuba – to which Khrushchevhad added: nor any other nation of the Western
hemisphere.Kennedy’s response was conciliatory. Hepraised the Soviet leader’s ‘statesmanlike deci-
sion’, but would not help him to save face bymaking public the US promise to remove theAmerican missiles from Turkey. The missile crisis
was over. But tension lingered on for some weeks.
The Americans were also demanding the removal
of Soviet bombers. The Russians gave way on thatissue only late in November. Castro, who had notbeen consulted, was in a rage. Feeling that he had
been used, a pawn in the American–Soviet con-
frontation, he called Khrushchev a son of a bitch,
Mao Zedong stepped in to increase his rancour.
Castro refused to cooperate with the detailed procedures for removing the missiles, but theRussians honoured their undertaking to remove
them. Kennedy then lifted the quarantine of Cuba
and, exploiting Castro’s lack of cooperation,
watered down the US commitment not to invadeCuba by writing to Khrushchev, ‘there need beno fear of any invasion of Cuba while matters taketheir present favourable course’ (italics added). Notreaty was ever concluded between the Soviet572WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
Union and the US formally setting out what hadbeen agreed, but both countries have, for the lastthree decades, acted as if there had been one.What then was the significance of the Cubanmissile crisis? What were the lessons drawn fromit by contemporaries and what assessment can bemade with hindsight?How near had the US and Soviet Union cometo war, how near to the brink of a nuclear holo-
caust? Recent evidence reveals they were much
closer to catastrophe than was thought earlier.While Kennedy had to assume some missiles andeven a few nuclear warheads could have reached
Cuba before the blockade was in force, the
Pentagon had badly underestimated the Soviet
military presence on the island. What might havehappened if Kennedy had given the ﬁnal order toinvade Cuba on 28 October? That could have
brought into play another catastrophic risk the
Pentagon knew nothing about at the time. Not
only were eighteen medium-range missiles (1,050miles) and twenty-four intermediate-range mis-siles (2,100 miles), with some nuclear warheads
which were kept at a separate location, already on
the island, but in addition the Soviet commanders
in Cuba had available nuclear short-range (31
miles) Luna missiles. Soviet commanders weredebarred from using them. The orders to ﬁre
them were secret, locked in a Kremlin safe. But
Soviet commanders had been given the freedom
to use non-nuclearmissiles if attacked. What ifthey were confronted with a large seaborne inva-sion and found themselves in a predicament todefend themselves? They might as well have ﬁred
the nuclearLuna missiles and decimated theinvading force. There would not have been time
to wait to ﬁnd out what the Kremlin had decided
thousands of miles away. War would then havebeen certain. Khrushchev must have been terri-ﬁed at this point that he would lose control, espe-
cially after a commander in Cuba had already shot
down a U-2 plane.Most attention has been paid to Kennedy’shandling of the crisis, less to the clever wayKhrushchev extricated the Soviet Union. He held
a weak hand of cards. The crisis had to be dif-
fused quickly. But Khrushchev did not capitulatein panic. He extracted the valuable concessionthat the US would not invade Cuba and extin-guish communist rule by military force, in return
for the removal of the missiles. That at least had
fulﬁlled part of their purpose. The removal of the
US missiles in Turkey later on was an additionalface saver. How should Kennedy be judged? Thememoir literature of participants and the out-
pouring of academic work reveal a wide variety 
of views. Broadly speaking, the almost wholly
favourable view of Kennedy’s handling was pop-
ularised by his brother in his book Thirteen Days,the theme of which is that Kennedy’s ﬂexible
responses and careful handling won for the US all
its essential interests – forcing the Russians to pull
back from challenging the US in the Western
hemisphere, and convincing them that the UShad the courage to stand up to nuclear blackmail.This positive assessment has been challenged by
Republicans and revisionist historians. Nixon in
1964 blamed Kennedy for having ‘pulled defeat
out of the jaws of victory’. In other words,Kennedy had the opportunity to call the Sovietbluff and to overthrow Castro; instead, Castro
became secure. Kennedy had, in fact, appeased.
Crucial was Robert Kennedy’s role, based on his
brother’s trust. His frequent meetings with the
Soviet agent Georgi Bolshakov conveyed conﬁ-dential information of the president’s views andsoundings for terms of a diplomatic settlement.The romantic Camelot representation ofKennedy was not sustained in later years. There
is much that can be criticised in the handling by the US of relations with Cuba. OperationMongoose was misconceived and a failure. But 
to Kennedy’s credit a close analysis of the crisis
itself does not support the charge that he tried to
enhance his macho image. The evidence indicates
a cautious president weighing up all the possibleconsequences of every move. Kennedy avoideddriving Khrushchev into a corner from which
there was no escape, and the world was able to
breathe a sigh of relief that the leaders in the
Kremlin had proved, not fanatical ideologues, butrational pragmatists.The US in the 1960s remained in a positionof overwhelming nuclear superiority. But the cre-
ation of a Soviet base with nuclear-armed missiles1ON THE BRINK OF A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST573
and bombers close to the US would have beenseen as a Soviet advance into the Western hemi-sphere and would have supported Khrushchev’s
boast that the Monroe Doctrine was dead.
Although there was much criticism among
NATO allies of America’s failure to consult ade-quately during the crisis, had the US hesitated toaccept so direct a challenge to what it regarded
as its own vital interests (even though there were
many who criticised the current US interpretation
of the Monroe Doctrine), doubts would have
been raised about its readiness to defend WesternEurope in the face of a Russian threat withnuclear weapons out of fear that this could have
led to a nuclear attack on the US.As we now know, Kennedy did not alwaysretain his cool judgement during the crisis, andhis nerves were at times stretched taut, but healways regained his balance in time. He did not
jump to hasty conclusions, did not surround
himself with men who would tell him only what
he wanted to hear. On the contrary he encour-aged free discussion of all the different points ofview, an exploration of every option, while reserv-
ing to himself the ﬁnal decision. His handling of
his colleagues was skilful, as he took care to extract
every piece of information that might be import-
ant in his decision-making. He did not allowhimself to be rushed into overreaction. While itis true that the roots of the crisis must be attrib-

uted to Washington’s handling of Castro since
1959, the immediate cause was Khrushchev’s
decision to challenge US dominance in theCaribbean. Had he succeeded in that challenge,what would he have tried next? He would cer-
tainly have been encouraged to ‘rectify’ Soviet
weaknesses elsewhere, for instance in Berlin.The crisis was followed by a reassessment ofnuclear-war theories. McNamara became aconvert to the view that nuclear weapons could
not be used in limited war; indeed, they were not
weapons that could be used at all except as a
deterrent to starting a war; and so the doctrine ofmutual assured destruction (MAD) was devel-
oped. According to this theory, peace between
the Western and Eastern alliances, could be pre-
served provided each side knew that it could notknock out the arsenal of an opponent’s nuclearmissiles in a ﬁrst strike; in other words, a sufﬁ-cient number of missiles would survive a hostile
ﬁrst strike and would be used in a counter-attack
to destroy the opponent’s country. An important
lesson learnt from the crisis was that the ‘game’approach to handling international relations wasfar too dangerous in the nuclear age.Rusk’s ‘they blinked ﬁrst’ conclusion is moreappropriate to the era of the Hollywood Western
than to a nuclear showdown. One significant
result of the crisis was the establishment of a ‘hotline’ between the Kremlin and the White Housein 1963 in an effort to avoid any future possibil-
ity of miscalculation. It was not actually a tele-
phone link but a simple teleprinter. This was later
improved and by 1983 maps and other data couldbe rapidly transmitted.The two superpowers had discovered commoninterests. The most important was that ‘surprises’
were exceedingly dangerous in the nuclear age.
There was also an urgent need to prevent moreand more nations from acquiring the capacity tomake their own nuclear weapons: control should
be retained in the hands of the superpowers. Two
agreements were concluded in the next ﬁve years,
designed to inhibit development by other nations.
In August 1963 the ‘limited’ Test Ban Treaty wassigned. This forbade testing in the atmosphere, inouter space and underwater; but, because the
Soviet Union and the US wanted to develop their
weapons further, testing underground was per-
mitted. That was one serious ﬂaw; another wasthat no nation could be forced to join. France and China continued to test their weapons in 
the atmosphere. The second treaty, which was
expected to be more signiﬁcant, was the agree-
ment on the non-proliferation of nuclear weap-
ons, signed on 1 July 1968. This bound its signatories not to transfer their nuclear weaponsto non-nuclear nations or to help them to man-
ufacture their own weapons. The Soviet Union
had already recognised its common interests with
the US by withdrawing all assistance from China.Just as important as the bombs were the mis-siles that delivered them. Britain was a third sig-
natory to these treaties of the ‘nuclear club’; it
made its own hydrogen bombs but needed US574WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
missiles to deliver them. When Prime MinisterHarold Macmillan and Kennedy met at Nassau inthe Bahamas in December 1962, the Anglo-
American special relationship was sufficiently
intact for the US president, who held the avun-
cular Macmillan in high regard, to promise toprovide the Polaris missile for British submarines.The Soviet Union and the US, with Britain as a
junior partner, thus tried to provide a lead, per-
forming a policeman’s role, in preventing the
spread of nuclear weapons, though at the same
time they themselves were updating and increas-ing their own arsenals. The efforts to limit thespread of nuclear weapons in the world were
doomed to failure.The 1960s and 1970s ushered in an unprece-dented nuclear-arms race between the SovietUnion and the US. They trusted each other nomore than before, despite their shared interest 
in making the world a less dangerous place by 
not placing control of nuclear weapons in the
hands of other states. This did not prevent the Kremlin from stationing nuclear warheads and missiles under Soviet control in Poland and
East Germany, any more than it prevented the 
US and Britain from doing the same in West
Germany and Italy. The US–Soviet detente of the
1960s and 1970s coincided not only with hugemilitary expenditure but also with acute rivalry inthe Third World.The most uncomfortable truth learnt from theCuban missile crisis was that the decision to inﬂict
or not to inﬂict radiation poisoning on much ofthe world lay in the hands of potentially unpre-dictable leaders in Moscow and Washington. In
both the democratic and the communist states,
the crucial decision-making depended on a
handful of men, on their judgement, stability and
good sense as they operated behind closed doors.The US president informed the Western allies,even conferred with them, but in the end he made
his own decision. The Kremlin is unlikely even to
have consulted allies. It was comforting, however,
that the West was evidently not dealing with fanat-ics of Hitler’s kind. For the Kremlin leadershipthe mercurial temperament of Khrushchev posed
too great a danger, and the risks he took during
the missile crisis contributed to his fall in 1964.Turning to US policy in the hemisphere, itsefforts to line up all Latin America against Cubaafter the ‘Bay of Pigs’ ﬁasco was not an unquali-
fied success. Cuba was expelled from the
Organisation of American States in February
1962, but the countries of Latin America refusedto follow the US in imposing a general tradeembargo. Nor was the US able to stop trade
between its NATO allies and Cuba. Canada, for
example, became an important exporter to, and
importer from, Cuba. The loss of the US market
for Cuba’s sugar, its main export earner, threat-ened enormous dislocation until the Soviet Unionﬁlled the breach. Up to the 1990s, Castro became
dependent on Soviet largesse to bolster Cuba’s
failing economy as well as on ill-advised loans
from Western banks, which are unlikely to gettheir money back. Sabotage efforts directed fromthe US against vital Cuban targets, such as sugar
mills, electric power stations and communications
centres, continued until President Johnson ended
them in April 1964. American policies deeplyinjured Cuba, but the objective of getting rid ofCastro and his communist regime, at ﬁrst through
military and economic means and later by eco-
nomic and diplomatic isolation, demonstrably
failed. For the ﬁrst time since 1898, Cuba’s pow-
erful neighbour no longer controlled the island’sdestiny.Cuban national pride is one reason why Castrohad survived for half a century. The redistribution
of income in favour of the poor and from the
cities to the agricultural regions gained him solidsupport among the peasantry. Better health careand education were genuine achievements of the
revolution. The poor, during the early years,
became ardent adherents of the revolution. But
Cuba has suffered from the inefﬁciencies of its
socialist policies and command economy. Withthe collapse of the Soviet Union, the future forthe people of Cuba looked grim.The American trade embargo was designed tobring about Castro’s fall and the end of the com-
munist regime after intervention by force wasabandoned after the missile crisis. Castro’sauthoritarian rule and human rights abuses have
prevented the regime’s full acceptance by the
West. By 2005 Castro had become the longest1ON THE BRINK OF A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST575
surviving head of state. The majority of theCuban people have known no other leader; a kindof national monument in the new century. For a
number of reasons the justiﬁcation for not nor-
malising relations with Cuba has become increas-
ingly less persuasive. The continuing US tradeembargo injuring Cuba fails to serve any goodpurpose. In any case it has become a sieve, loop-
holes allow US companies to export food to Cuba
and tourism ﬂourishes. Some forty per cent of its
trade is conducted with the European Union
alone. Realities have encouraged both the US andthe European Union to open diplomatic missionsin Cuba. In Latin America during the last half
century human rights abuses were committed by
governments, recognised and even supported by
Western countries including the US, with recordsworse than Cuba’s. Castro will not live forever.Change will inevitably come to Cuba in the
twenty-ﬁrst century, but it will be brought about
not by foreign intervention but by the masses dis-
contented with their low standard of living andrepression.Once the immediate crisis was over in 1962, therest of the world debated a new question: was it
really safe to rely on the Soviet Union and the US
in relation to questions vital to the superpowers’own security and well-being? Indeed, would theUS and the Soviet Union, whatever they said,
really risk a holocaust of their own peoples for the
defence of others? Two nations, China and
France, openly deﬁed the superpowers and builtup their own nuclear-missile forces. Neitheraccepted the policeman role of the USSR and the
US in the world; Mao sought to develop inde-
pendent Asian policies, and de Gaulle to construct
a European role while he denounced US domin-
ance. Britain was punished for its pretensions andits ‘subservience’ to the US by de Gaulle’s vetoof its application to join the European Common
Market. But successive British governments have
essentially followed de Gaulle’s nuclear policy byinsisting on the preservation of an independentnuclear-strike capacity, even though it has relied
on US missiles. There was much national postur-
ing, but NATO continued to be regarded asessential for Western defence.In fact, only the Soviet Union was able toblock nuclear proliferation – among its own
Warsaw Pact allies. West Germany and Japan did
not attempt to join the race. The spread of know-
ledge could not be prevented and the profitmotive ensured that ‘peaceful’ nuclear reactorswere exported from the advanced nations to the
Second and Third World. Plutonium for weapons
could be made by these reactors, as India demon-
strated when it exploded a bomb in May 1974.West Germany has supplied reactors to Brazil; theUS has supplied them to Egypt and Israel; France
to South Africa, Iraq and South Korea; Canada
to the Argentine.There is no certainty how many countries,besides the core nuclear-weapon nations – theUS, the USSR, Britain, France and China – plusIndia, Pakistan, South Africa (which has given
them up) and Israel (which has not yet tested any)
are able to make their own. Nations with the
capacity include Chile, North Korea, Argentina,Brazil, Israel and, until the second Gulf War, Iraq.Nuclear non-proliferation has failed, and there are
many ﬁngers on the nuclear trigger now. The cer-
tainty that these terrible weapons cannot be used
without risk of self-destruction has so far pre-served the world. The forty-year threat of nuclearwar between the US and the Soviet Union was
ﬁnally lifted by the demolition of the Berlin Wall
and the end of the Cold War.576WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68

The 1960s were one of the most turbulentdecades in American history. The US fought an
unwinnable war in Vietnam thousands of miles
from home with young men in a largely con-scripted army. Protests against war increased asultimately more than half a million men were sent
to Indo-China and as the brutality of the ﬁghting
became clear to Americans at home. It was, 
furthermore, a decade of unprecedented black
protest and of an unusually violent backlashagainst political leaders, black and white. Threeassassinations were especially shocking: of Presi-
dent Kennedy in 1963, of his brother, and presi-
dential contender, Robert in 1968 and, shortly
before, of Martin Luther King, the leading non-violent voice in the civil rights movement. Themurders of the two Kennedy brothers were shown
on television, reaching into practically every
American home. Was the US still governable?In Dallas on 22 November 1963 a tragedyunfolded before the nation’s eyes. The smilingpresident, his radiant wife beside him, was ridingin a slow motorcade, waving to the crowds. When
his car reached a point opposite a dreary ofﬁce
building, the Texas School Book Depository,
shots rang out from an upstairs window. Thepresident fell backwards; a bullet had passedthrough his head and throat.Lee Harvey Oswald, an unbalanced 24-year-old ex-marine attracted to communist causes and
to the defence of Cuba, recently returned fromthe Soviet Union and with a Russian-born wife,had assassinated President Kennedy. The right inAmerica accused the communists of an assassina-
tion plot; others from the left claimed that irrec-
oncilable conservatives had plotted the murder ofa popular and liberal president. There appeared tobe awkward facts that did not sit with the con-

clusion that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone.
In a bizarre scene, captured by the television
cameras a few days later, Oswald was in turn slain
by a nightclub owner before he could give evi-dence at his trial. Violence was again seen to bea strong undercurrent in American society. The
vice-president, Lyndon Johnson, who had been
completely overshadowed by Kennedy, now
stood in the limelight. Unelected to the ofﬁce, hewould have to see out the remaining fourteenmonths of the presidency.Lyndon Johnson was the eldest son of a smallfarmer married to the daughter of a prosperous
lawyer. He had climbed the political ladder the
hard way, with much careful calculation, enteringWashington politics in 1937 as a congressman whofervently admired Roosevelt. By the time he came
to serve in the Senate, eventually becoming Senate
Majority Leader in 1955, he had become much
more conservative, reﬂecting the majority of his
Texan electorate. His skill in managing the Senate,applying his persuasive powers to individual sena-

tors in what became known as the Johnson
Treatment, earned him a reputation for effective-

ness among Washington insiders. Johnson mighthave echoed the words of Robert Louis Stevenson1Chapter 53THE LIMITS OF POWERTHE US DURING THE 1960sand declared that his politics were ‘to change whatwe can, to better what we can ...’. This meant rec-
onciling reformers and those opposed to social
change, persuading the more liberal legislators that
half a loaf was better than none, and those who
were more conservative that acceptance of somereform would avert the danger of more fundamen-
tal and undesirable change. But, as vice-president,
Johnson had made little impact nationally; that all
changed as he stood grim-faced next to Jackie
Kennedy aboard Air Force One as he was sworn in
as president.Appearances proved deceptive. The Kennedyimage and dynamism seemed to have died with
the assassinated president as the older man, who
had already suffered one heart attack, started his
term of ofﬁce with the words, ‘Let us continue.’Johnson proved much more successful thanKennedy in gaining congressional approval for the
moderate measures already sent to Capitol Hill,
where they had lain logjammed by the opposition
of Congress. Bills for foreign aid, for wider accessto college and university education, and for taxreductions to stimulate the economy all passed
into law. Among the most signiﬁcant legislative
leftovers from the Kennedy administration but
enacted under its successor was a bill concerning
civil rights.‘Civil rights’ meant, in effect, legislation toremove the discrimination and disabilities suffered
by non-white Americans, the great majority of
whom were African American. Between 1950 and
1980 the total population of the US increasedfrom 152.3 million to 227.7 million. The major-ity of those Americans classiﬁed as ‘non-white’
were ‘black’, that is, 15 million in 1950 and 26.6
million in 1980. The Hispanics from Puerto Rico
(US citizens) and Latin America are the second-
largest ethnic minority, numbering 14.6 millionin 1980. The population from Asia also increasedrapidly; joining the Chinese and Japanese immi-
grants of the late nineteenth century, there now
came a large influx of Filipinos, Koreans and
Vietnamese. But it was the African Americanswho led the civil rights protests with a success thatinﬂuenced other ethnic minority movements.The decade from the early 1960s to the early1970s became one of stark contrasts, the federaladministration, Congress and the Supreme Courtplaying a leading role in supporting civil rightsand intervening against the attempts by the
Southern states to apply state laws to suppress
black protest and demonstrations. At the same
time the federal government sought to banishpoverty through an expansion of social securityentitlements and payments. It was thus a decade
of reform not witnessed since Roosevelt’s New
Deal. But there was an important difference:
unlike in the 1930s, in the 1960s the US was
riding an economic boom that seemed self-generating provided administrations just keptspending. The 1960s also saw a loosening of cus-
tomary restraints, as a new generation made news
by rejecting sexual furtiveness and taboos. But the
liberal hope of integrating society, the AfricanAmericans and the whites and the other ethnicminorities, of lessening the gulf between rich and
poor, of establishing a consensus on America’s
mission to lead the free world, ended instead in
bitter conﬂict and deep disillusionment.At the close of the period a president facingimpeachment left the White House in disgrace,
Richard Nixon becoming the first president 
to resign his ofﬁce. Ofﬁcers of the respected Fed-

eral Bureau of Investigation, the incorruptible
‘Untouchables’ who had broken the gangsters ofthe 1930s, were now revealed as having infringed,under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover, the civil
liberties of American citizens. The Central
Intelligence Agency had likewise become virtually
a law unto itself, and the seamy side of Washingtonpolitics caused widespread disillusionment with thewhole process of government.Ten years earlier, in the South, the black protestmovement of the 1960s gathered such force that
it overwhelmed the efforts of Democrats, enjoyingwidespread support from their fellow whites, to‘keep the niggers in their place’. The enforced 
segregation of the African American citizens and
the humiliations to which they were daily exposed
to remind them that they were ‘inferior’ racially –a system that was called apartheid in South Africa– was very much alive and well in the US in the
1960s, and not only in the South. In the nation’s
capital, Washington, discrimination would prove a578WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
serious handicap to America’s claims to lead thefree world in newly independent Africa and else-where. ‘Whites only’ signs could still be seen
prominently posted in many eating places in the
South. But thousands of African Americans would
no longer accept this state of affairs.Martin Luther King, a Baptist minister, hadrisen to prominence as one of the leaders of the
mass protests in Montgomery, Alabama during
the 1950s. The black churches were the one place
African Americans could gather in large numbers
without being harassed by state laws used againstdemonstrations and African American meetings.The black people in Montgomery, inspired by
King’s doctrine of non-violent militant protest
and unafraid of arrest and imprisonment, achieved
two things by asserting their rights. The blackprotest movement gained self-conﬁdence and asense of its own strength; it also brought black
protest in the South to national attention. In a
decade when the new magic of television could
carry pictures of police setting their dogs onunarmed protesters and could convey the deter-mined mood of black people and their leadersinto millions of American homes, it prompted
localised black protests and brought sympathy
and support from all over the country. The 
violence perpetrated by white Southerners onunarmed civil rights supporters shocked mostAmericans. Seeing and not just reading about it
made a considerable difference.In 1960 four young black students sat down atan ‘all-white’ luncheon counter in a Woolworths in
Greensboro, North Carolina. They were notserved. Soon sit-ins spread everywhere. What wasnew was that the African Americans were taking
the initiative, not just waiting on Congress, the
courts or the federal government to assert and pro-

tect their rights. Black and white segregation onbuses travelling from state to state was already ille-
gal; yet even this right had to be asserted, because
many laws which in theory safeguarded black
people from discrimination were not being
enforced. In 1961, Northern African Americans1THE LIMITS OF POWER579
In Martin Luther King, all Americans, regardless of colour, had a charismatic leader and spokesman for human-
ity. Shown here in Baltimore, shortly after becoming the ﬁrst African American to win the Nobel Peace Prize.© Leonard Freed/Magnum Photossupported by whites attempted to travel throughthe Southern states by bus. These Freedom Riders,as they came to be called, many of them students,
were set upon and brutally attacked in the South,
and their buses were burnt. They were deliberately
challenging the Kennedy administration to pro-tect their rights. Robert Kennedy, the attorney-general, eventually provided federal protection
from mob violence but not from illegal arrest. He
was hoping to reach acceptable compromises in
the South when the time for such compromises
was long past. The efforts of the administrationwere concentrated on civil rights legislation, aboveall to prevent the debarring of black votes by intim-

idation and by spurious literacy requirements in
the Southern states. It was held up in Congress. In
August 1963 Martin Luther King and other blackleaders organised a great march on Washington of200,000 people, both black and white, warning of
a ‘whirlwind of revolt’ if racial injustices were not
remedied. But the Kennedy administration haddrawn the sting of this protest by identifying itselfwith the protesters.Kennedy was undoubtedly persuaded of themoral rightness of the black cause, but, though
he hated violence, he resented having the admin-
istration’s hand forced by black militancy. He felthe could not act too far ahead of Congress or ofwhite opinion in the South. The process of edu-
cation was a gradual one – too gradual for the
African Americans. Kennedy’s modest civil rights
proposals were still held up in Congress on the
day of his death. Johnson then speedily pushedthem through with the help of Robert Kennedy,who carried on as attorney-general. But violence
continued against the black people and the vol-
unteers from the north who were exercising their
rights to meet and protest. In Mississippi threeblack and two white civil rights workers werebeaten to death.The frustration of the African Americans wasaroused not merely by the hostility that prevented580WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
The march on Washington, which took place on 28 August 1963, was an impressing and ﬁtting culminationof the campaign for civil rights. © akg-imagesthem from exercising their voting rights but by a whole range of discriminatory practices.Unemployment among black people was three
times as high as among whites; black schools were
inferior to those of whites in the more prosperous
suburbs. And they were not only black – they werealso poor. Few African Americans had overcometheir disadvantages to rise to the middle class; few
possessed the necessary education to better them-

selves. Equal opportunity, even where it existed in
federal employment, was of little use to the major-

ity of black people without an improvement intheir basic living conditions. In the slums of the bigcities black people lived in overcrowded, rat-
infested ghettos. Crime was rife, the people
demoralised. The high-minded oratory of love and
passive resistance uttered by leaders such as MartinLuther King inspired many African Americans tojoin in the stirring freedom-song ‘We shall over-

come’.But other, more radical black leaders also wonan increasing following. They did not call forbrotherly love and integration with white society,a sharing of Christian values and materialist aspir-
ations. The African Americans were gaining their
national freedom and their self-respect in Africa
– why not in America too? The appeal of these
black leaders was to a sense of self-identiﬁcation,‘black is beautiful’, and a rejection of white values,among them the ‘capitalist system’ of oppression.
In the North Malcolm X was preaching a heady
mixture of protest, revolt and separate black
nationhood. ‘I see America through the eyes ofthe victim. I don’t see any American dream – Isee an American nightmare’, he declared. Then
in February 1965 he was assassinated. Elijah
Muhammad led a black religious movement,
turning African Americans from mainstream
American religions to the Muslim faith, which hadwon many converts in Africa. To emphasise theirseparate identity his followers changed their
names; the best known was the unbeaten world
heavyweight boxing champion who adopted the
name of Muhammad Ali. There were now manyAfrican Americans for whom passive resistance wasnot enough. The Black Panthers armed them-
selves, ready to defend black people with the gun.
By the close of the 1960s, when federal laws hadbrought little change in the living conditions ofthe majority in the ghettos, the doctrine of separ-ateness and violent protest – Black Power – had
won over many new adherents.The violence that exploded in New York’sHarlem in 1964 was spontaneous rather thanorganised, but it spread through the ghettos fromcoast to coast in the next few years. The presence
of white police, the symbol of white authority,
could now spark a whole area of a city into an
orgy of destruction. One of the worst city riots
erupted in the black Watts community of LosAngeles in the summer of 1965. Indeed, summerafter summer, when the heat made the over-
crowded ghettos least bearable, violence would
break out in cities all over America. In 1967 parts
of Detroit and Newark were set alight; after theassassination of Martin Luther King in Memphis,Tennessee on 4 April 1968, there were riots in
hundreds of towns across America. King’s funeral
brought white and black leaders brieﬂy together
in a show of unity and revulsion against the racistfanaticism that endangered the lives of all promi-nent African Americans. But fundamental obsta-
cles to racial reconciliation could not be suddenly
removed. They exist still.Desegregation made slow progress in educa-tion and job opportunities. With successive civilrights measures and increasing federal enforce-ment of these laws, spectacular progress was
made, however, in one area – black voting rights.
A cynic might observe that the African Americans
tended to vote Democrat, and it was Johnson’sDemocratic administration that had taken action.Nonetheless, the hold of the racist white politi-
cians was broken. In 1952 only one in ﬁve of the
Southern African Americans had been able to reg-
ister for the vote; by 1968 it was three out of ﬁve,

the same proportion as white voters.Black people began to hold important cityofﬁces too. By 1977 seventy-six American cities
had elected black mayors. Where the majority of
African Americans failed to make substantial
inroads was in health care, housing, income andeconomic power. The ghettos persisted. Almostthree decades of protest and violence have not
much changed the economic disadvantages of 
the majority of black people in employment,1THE LIMITS OF POWER581
especially of teenagers. By the end of the 1970sone in three African Americans had incomesbelow the poverty line, and the position of black
youths and black women was made worse by the
higher incidence of family breakdowns as many
mothers with young children became dependenton welfare. But educational opportunities havegiven a minority of African Americans middle-
class incomes and status, perhaps as many as a
third. The effect of this rise of a black middle class
has been to divide black society. It has not made
the ghettos less violent or better places to live in;indeed, some areas of New York City, with theirburnt-down and dilapidated housing, began to
look like the bombed cities of Europe in 1945.
But in the mid-1960s, violence at home was
mirrored by violence abroad.In 1964 the human and material costs of the warin Vietnam were still insigniﬁcant for Americans.
Johnson saw no reason why the nation’s growing
wealth should not be simultaneously applied toassist South Vietnam and to fund programmes athome ensuring the welfare of all of America’s
citizens. In November 1964 he won the presi-
dential election by a landslide over a right-wing
Republican, Barry Goldwater. But a signiﬁcant
conservative backlash had developed against theDemocratic notions of reform through federal-ledaction. These ‘radical conservatives’ wanted a
return to American self-reliance, less government
and a much tougher war on communism. Their
time was to come with the election of RonaldReagan two decades later.During his short ﬁrst term in ofﬁce Johnsonhad already established an outstanding record as
a reformer who got things done; a tax-reduction
bill and a civil rights bill had been approved by
Congress. In his ﬁrst State of the Union messageJohnson declared ‘unconditional war’ on thegreatest national blemish – the poverty and des-
titution amid plenty of a large segment of
American society. Between 1964 and 1967 the
Johnson administration spent just over $6 billionon anti-poverty programmes, food stamps, jobtraining, small business loans and community-
action programmes to motivate the poor to help
themselves. Even this proved to be too little, andfederal aid did not always help the most needy.That large enough tax revenues could be gener-ated to help all the poor and that a huge state-
directed programme would work without large
sums being squandered or lining the wrong
pockets turned out to be illusions.The aid was not all wasted. State educationand college education received extensive support
and improved both in quality and in the number
of students beneﬁting. In its provision of a welfare
and medical ‘safety net’ for the poor and elderly,
the US was far behind what was being provid-ed in most West European countries. Even so, interest groups such as the American Medical
Association protested against ‘socialised medi-
cine’. In 1965 Johnson secured the passage of the
Medicare legislation; ﬁnanced through tax andadministered by the social security system, it pro-vides for hospital and nursing-home care for the
elderly. Medicaid made federal funds available to
help the needy. Unfortunately medical costs
through the years soon proved an almost bot-tomless pit. Between 1964 and 1968 Johnson,supported by a compliant Congress, provided the
leadership that passed into law these Great Society
programmes, which included the federal funding
of urban renewal.It is fashionable now to decry these social pro-grammes and to label them as failures. The prob-lems of poverty and of the lack of equal
opportunities were too deep and extensive to be
eradicated by Johnson’s Great Society pro-
grammes. But millions of Americans were helped,not least the elderly, and new educational oppor-tunities have provided a ladder for social advance-
ment. Nonetheless, the US government was only
providing what was regarded as a matter of course
in France and Britain in the 1960s and 1970s. As
entitlements to aid expanded over the next twodecades in the US, the total cost threatened tomake social security insolvent. In the 1980s the
Reagan administration began cutting back the
Great Society programmes while increasing
defence expenditure, so running up the largestbudget deﬁcits of any American administration.During the early years of his presidencyJohnson judged that American economic growth
could fund the Great Society programmes without582WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
the need to increase taxation, which was politicallyunpopular. In the course of 1966 opinion pollsshowed that support for him had dropped from 63
to 44 per cent. Why? The reasons are not hard to
ﬁnd: the black riots in the cities exposing the
shortcomings of the Great Society, the tribula-tions of an economy beset by rising inﬂation, theshadow of the escalating war in Vietnam, and the
president’s apparent loss of interest in social
reform as he grew more absorbed in his efforts to
bring the war to a victorious conclusion. The
‘silent majority’ no doubt still regarded asunthinkable the possibility that the US might notwin a war, but the revolt against American
involvement in Vietnam began to encourage an
increasingly vociferous opposition, exasperated by
the hollowness of repeated claims that victory wasaround the corner.Meanwhile, the brutality of the war in Vietnamwas vividly portrayed on millions of television
screens: the attacks on poor peasants, the burningof their huts, the heartlessness of combatants.Civil rights and Vietnam protests linked up – was
this a black man’s war? In 1967 Martin Luther
King spoke out, ‘This madness must cease.’ How
the Johnson administration came to lose direction
has been chronicled in documents, such as theleaked Pentagon Papers. In September 1964,before any substantial US commitment had been
made, Johnson had asked his advisers whether
‘Vietnam was worth all this effort’. His scepticism
was met with the unanimous response that theloss of South Vietnam would be followed in timeby the loss of all south-east Asia. Johnson’s error
was his failure to question that ‘expert’ judge-
ment; by ‘loss’ in this context was meant the com-
munist domination not only of South Vietnam
but also of Malaya, Thailand, Laos, Cambodiaand Indonesia, possibly even of the Philippines.Exactly how this could actually occur was never
explained; it was just assumed. So South Vietnam
became the Cold War front-line state of Asia, as
West Germany was in Europe – though theanalogy was a false one. The whole of south-eastAsia did not turn communist and the communists
in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were later to be
locked in struggles among themselves with rivalcommunist Soviet and Chinese backing. Thisnationalist, inter-communist rivalry was notanticipated or understood in Washington.In August 1964, in a controversial incident,North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked an
American destroyer in the Gulf of Tonkin; despiteUS claims, it is not certain that the destroyer didnot itself provoke hostilities. Two days later there
was allegedly a second attack, though there is
doubt whether it occurred at all. But the signiﬁ-
cance of these incidents was the strong reaction
in the US. With the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution,Congress granted Johnson the widest discretionto repel armed attack on US forces and ‘to
prevent further aggression’; the president was
empowered to take all ‘necessary steps, including
the use of armed force’ to assist any nationcovered by the SEATO treaty that asked for assis-tance ‘in defence of its freedom’. That blanket
authorisation applied to South Vietnam. It meant
the president could practically go to war in
Vietnam without formally declaring war orseeking congressional support for war. At thetime Congress did not anticipate the conse-
quences of the resolution, nor was American
public opinion much excited by it. Nor, indeed,
did Johnson in 1964 anticipate a large-scale US
war effort. The Tonkin Resolution was simplyintended to give him the discretion to punish theNorth Vietnamese, but it was nonetheless
regarded as essential to bring stability to an inde-
pendent and non-communist South Vietnam in
order to counter Khrushchev’s claim to have theright to support ‘wars of national liberation’.Secretary McNamara had by now enunciated the
‘domino theory’ in justiﬁcation for US involve-
ment. Yet in August 1964 Vietnam was still seen
by the public as no more than a minor problem:
the US would need only to ﬂex its muscles forthe communists to back down.Seven months later, in the early spring of1965, the punishment of the North Vietnamese
was stepped up as US bombing raids against mil-
itary targets began. This was Operation RollingThunder, which was expected to bring victorywithout costly US losses. Airfields in South
Vietnam that served as bases for these raids soon
came under communist land attack. Escalation1THE LIMITS OF POWER583
followed: in March 1965 US marines were sentto defend the US airbases; before long they cameto be used not only in defence but in wider-
ranging combat missions.A consensus was reached by Johnson’s advis-ers. The Vietcong could be defeated, and theNorth Vietnamese would be forced to negotiateonce they realised they could not win. It was
assumed that the pattern seen during the Korean
War could be repeated and that the Vietcong
without North Vietnamese backing amounted to
no real threat. Robert McNamara’s ‘militaryoption’ was approved by everyone, not least bythe congressional leaders consulted. But approval
was not quite universal: one man warned that, by
increasing the numbers of US combat troops and
the frequency of bombing raids, the US stillwould not achieve its aim of stabilising a non-communist South Vietnam. The under secretary
of state George Ball advised the president against
military escalation. Johnson too was sceptical at
ﬁrst, asking if the North Vietnamese would notbe able to match any American escalation. But inthe end he was persuaded that America’s stand-
ing throughout the world would suffer disas-

trously if the US ‘abdicated leadership’ and
showed irresolution. Communists would only
continue their aggression. One general spoke ofthe need for 500,000 men and a conﬂict thatwould last ﬁve years. The president hoped that a
combination of increasing military pressure on the
ground and punishment from the air, provided it
was coupled with peace offers, would force theNorth Vietnamese to call off the conflict andaccept the existing division of Vietnam. The
South would be saved for the free world. But
President Johnson’s gut instincts made him
uneasy and hesitant.The momentous decision to plan for a majorwar was taken in the White House in July 1965,after extensive discussion by the president and his
closest advisers. There was little recognition that
the South Vietnamese were ﬁghting among them-
selves and that the North Vietnamese were alsoVietnamese. Worst of all, by painting such a cat-astrophic scenario it seemed justiﬁable to avert it
by virtually any means. From some 175,000
combat troops, American involvement by the endof 1967 had risen to 525,000. The NorthVietnamese and Vietcong matched and outpacedthe US build-up. The impact of this on Vietnam
is described elsewhere, but victory over the com-
munists proved as elusive as ever. General William
Westmoreland, commanding US forces in SouthVietnam, then called for further large reinforce-ments. But how much more would American
public opinion take, with American casualties
mounting daily? Throughout 1967 the assess-

ment made by the military and intelligence ser-
vices on the ground war was optimistic: Americantroops and their South Vietnamese allies weregrinding down the enemy. This was the reassur-
ing message given to the American people – with
steadfast determination the war would be won.Then followed a rude awakening. During theVietnamese Tet holidays, on 31 January 1968,the Vietcong mounted a huge offensive, pene-
trating several towns in an attempt to destroy the
morale of the South Vietnamese and Americans,
who believed that their power was conﬁned to the countryside. In the end the communists were bloodily repulsed, but the terrible scenes 
of ﬁghting shown on American television screens
convinced most Americans that US soldiers
should be brought home. The ability of the 
communists to penetrate and even to hold theirpositions in a number of South Vietnamese townshitherto believed to be firmly in South Viet-
namese and American hands succeeded in under-
mining American morale in their longest and
most unsuccessful war. The president’s assurancesthat the Tet offensive was the most disastrousVietcong defeat of the war were perfectly true,
but they carried little conviction.Nothing was coming right. The dropping of1.2 million tons of bombs a year had not broken
the determination nor destroyed the fightingcapability of the North Vietnamese. All diplo-matic efforts to bring them to the conference
table through a carrot-and-stick approach of alter-
nately halting and resuming the bombing had also
so far proved fruitless. The year 1967 was sup-posed to have brought victory. But early in 1968,after the Tet offensive, Washington was forced to
the awful conclusion that the US could no longer
win the war. Robert McNamara, one of the chief584WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68
architects of the military response, had lost faithin the prospect of victory and on 1 March 1968was replaced as secretary of defence by Clark
Clifford. The president could see no alternative.
The issue: should another 206,000 troops be 
sent to Vietnam, bringing numbers there toalmost three-quarters of a million? Clifford andthe president’s advisers rejected the increase. The
only hope now was that a continued war of attri-
tion would break North Vietnam’s will before
American public opinion, shaken by the Tet casu-
alties and the diminishing hopes for success,demanded withdrawal.Demonstrations against the war grew apace in 1965. The young of the more privileged and 
better-educated social groups of the 1960s felt a
new sense of liberation, a fresh vitality demandingthat they challenge the assumptions of theirelders. Protests and demonstrations erupted. In
April 1965, 25,000 marched to the White House.
In October a National Committee to end the war
in Vietnam was formed.Early in the following year
the highly respected Senator J. William Fulbrightbegan public hearings to ﬁnd out whether any
national interest was served by the war. The con-
trast with public attitudes to the defeat of Japan
and Germany in the Second World War or even to
the Korean War could not have been greater.America was deeply split. Johnson still enjoyed thesupport of the majority, but a powerful opposition
was forming. The most affected were the young
men called up to register for the draft with the
possibility of being sent to Vietnam. Before thewar ended for American servicemen in 1974,110,000 had burnt their draftcards and 40,000
young men had evaded call-up by leaving for
neighbouring Canada and for Europe.It was clear to Johnson by the spring of 1968that the Americanisation of the war, the sendingof more than half a million combat troops toVietnam, had become insupportable. His political
position at home had been severely eroded by the
war. He was challenged by a ‘peace candidate’,
Senator Eugene McCarthy, and also by RobertKennedy, both seeking the Democratic nomina-tion to run for the presidency in November that
year. On 31 March 1968 Johnson announced his
decision not to seek re-election; he also indicatedthat there would be a measure of disengagementfrom the war, reflecting the new consensusamong his advisers, including former hawks.That same March, Johnson announced apartial bombing halt and invited the North
Vietnamese to begin peace talks. The responsefrom Hanoi early in April was surprisingly posi-tive. But hopes of an early peace quickly faded as
the almost interminable negotiations in Paris fol-
lowed a tortuous path from their commencement
in May 1968 to their conclusion almost ﬁve years
later in January 1973. Nevertheless March 1968marks the time when the US took the ﬁrst stepto disengage from Vietnam. It was left to
Kissinger and Nixon to complete the process, to
try somehow to save South Vietnam and bring
the war to an ‘honourable’ end.The presidential election of 1968 was overshad-
owed by tragedy. In the run-up on 5 June, while
celebrating his victory in the Californian primary,
the almost certain Democratic contender RobertKennedy was assassinated in full view of the televi-
sion cameras. Personalities do matter in history.
With Eugene McCarthy now eliminated, the
choice for Democratic candidate fell on an old lib-

eral, the vice-president Hubert Humphrey, whose
association with Johnson’s Vietnam policies haddiscredited him among many liberal supporters. InChicago there were large demonstrations against
his candidature, brutally dispersed by police. All
this boded ill for Democratic prospects in
November. The durable Republican candidateRichard Nixon won by a large majority of states;though the popular vote was only narrowly in his
favour, 31.7 million to 31.2 million. What if
Robert Kennedy had been the candidate instead?
Nixon might well have lost to a Democratic candi-

date with the glamour of the Kennedy name.The 1970s proved for many Americans a trou-bled decade at home and a humiliating decade in
the wider world. Johnson’s dream of a new society
and American leadership of the free world had
been damaged by the experience of the VietnamWar, which overshadowed the administration’sachievements. What had led the American people
and their leaders into an enterprise that turned out
to be tragic for both Indo-China and the US?1THE LIMITS OF POWER585
First and foremost it was ignorance, a failureto understand the true nature of the conﬂict inVietnam, reducing it to the simple formula that
it was part of the worldwide struggle between the
free and the communists. But it was not a war
arising simply out of communist aggression fromNorth Vietnam. The Vietcong were a SouthVietnamese force, the expression of a political
opposition and disaffection with the rulers of
South Vietnam. It was this misreading of the sit-
uation that underlay the US decision to intervene
on a massive scale. The belief that superior tech-nology, the bombardment from the air, couldbreak the will and capacity to ﬁght of the North
Vietnamese and Vietcong caused heavy loss of life and terrible destruction, but in the end wasineffective. Nor could the ground forces defeat an enemy prepared to answer escalation with 
escalation. The military experts were wrong in
their optimistic assessments, and once President
Johnson had engaged American prestige he foundit impossible to pull out and to admit defeat. Butmeanwhile the war had been Americanised and,
after Tet, the propping up of an unviable South
Vietnamese government became increasingly
problematical. The US had been sucked into a
civil war and faced a determined and ruthlessenemy. Attrition in the end broke the Americanwill to continue ﬁghting in a distant country and
for a cause that was lost.586WHO WILL LIBERATE THE THIRD WORLD? 1954–68

TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
During the colonial era the armed strength of theEuropean nations had by and large subdued fac-
tional and national struggles in south-east Asia.
The British tried to leave Asia in an orderly way.Even so the partition of India was accompaniedby internal upheaval and great bloodshed, and the
legacy of partition was two more wars between
independent India and Pakistan. Seen in terms
only of British interests, the Labour government
had acted wisely in disentangling Britain fromdirect responsibility for the conﬂicts of southernAsia. The Dutch attempted to hold on too long
to their empire. Even after they left in December
1949, they retained West New Guinea, to which
Indonesia laid claim, though its mainly Stone Agepeoples were not Indonesian. After years of con-ﬂict the Dutch gave way and the renamed West
Irian was transferred to Indonesia by the United
Nations in 1963. The French also tried to turn
the clock back and to re-establish their pre-war
colonial domination, ﬁghting a bitter war withIndo-China until 1954.Tragically for the 330 million people (1989ﬁgure) of south-east Asia, the departure of the
Europeans did not produce a more peaceful era.
In what had been French Indo-China, that isLaos, Cambodia and Vietnam, ﬁghting continuedfor another twenty years and until the 1990s
Cambodia was painfully trying to ﬁnd a peaceful
compromise. The devastation and impoverish-
ment of this potentially fertile region of south-east Asia, with a population in 1989 of some 75million, identiﬁes the post-1945 period as the
most destructive in its modern history. To the
West lies the independent kingdom of Thailand,
a sometimes uncertain American ally that pro-vided bases for the US during the Vietnam Warand on its borders with Laos. Thailand accepted
400,000 Khmer Rouge refugees after 1979. To
the south, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia
kept out of any involvement in Indo-China, not
least because during 1963–6 they were locked inconfrontation with each other. Indonesia, thelargest and most populous of south-east Asian
states with 178.2 million inhabitants in 1989, fol-
lowed ambitious plans for expansion until the fall
of Achmed Sukarno from power in 1967. Burmapursued a policy of non-alignment and, under themilitary rule of General Ne Win from 1962 to
1988, remained largely in isolation. Finally the
Philippines, independent but still closely allied to
the US and dependent on American assistance,
made available to the US two bases, a naval baseat Subic Bay and Clark Air Base for the defenceof the Western Paciﬁc; the American presence and
inﬂuence was resented by a large proportion of
the population as an infringement of sovereignty.
In the decades since independence profoundchanges have occurred in each of the individualnations.In the countries that fell under Japanese occu-pation from 1941 to 1945 – Indonesia, Malaya,
Burma and Indo-China – indigenous resistanceand independence movements, which continued1Chapter 54TURMOIL, WAR AND BLOODSHED IN
SOUTH-EAST ASIAthe struggle for independence after 1945, creatednew balances of power. Whenever independencewas achieved by armed struggle, as in Indo-China
and Indonesia, the army tended to become an
important factor in the subsequent power strug-
gles, either forming an alliance with one of thepolitical elites or taking over control itself. South-east Asian countries have had to cope with severe
development problems – just feeding a rapidly
growing population was an immense challenge.
Within the newly independent countries the
power struggles between communists and non-communists produced strife and civil war.Arbitrary national frontiers inherited from the
colonial era were defended by those nations whose
interests they served and denounced by neigh-
bours who rejected the post-colonial settlement.The great majority of the people of south-eastAsia are still poor peasants. Although degrees of
state planning are common to the whole region, 
it is remarkable that with the exception of the 
former French Indo-China, no radical agrarianreforms were introduced anywhere in the region.Only the communists in Vietnam adopted ruth-
less collectivisation of the farms, a programme 
that had disastrous consequences. In the non-
communist countries of south-east Asia, the
largely feudal system of landlords, peasant-ownedfarms and landless peasants continues. Famine andunder-nourishment have afflicted the region,
aggravated by its high birth rate. But better meth-
ods of cultivation (introduced in 1960 and known
as the ‘green revolution’) and the increasing use ofpesticides and fertilisers have enabled food to beproduced faster than the population has grown.
But extremes of inequality and climatic calamities
have still left millions starving or near starvation.Many landless peasants have moved in despera-tion to the towns, with large numbers of younggirls turning to prostitution. The growth of thesedestitute populations in the shanty towns of Third
World cities has been one of the most tragic fea-
tures of development. In the years after independ-
ence, Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, grew fromless than 1.5 million inhabitants to over 11 millionin 2000, Delhi to more than 11 million, and that
of the capital of Pakistan, Karachi, rose from 1 mil-
lion to nearly 12 million. Amid this waste of Asianurban poverty the contrasting exceptions standout. One is prosperous Singapore, an islandrepublic whose population is concentrated in the
city of Singapore itself, which has grown from 1
million to over 4 million; the other is Phnom
Penh, the capital of Cambodia, whose populationwas barbarously driven out of the city into thecountryside, where the majority perished when
Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge forces captured the city in
1975. Under the ten-year Vietnamese occupation
Phnom Penh slowly recovered, achieving an
estimated population in 1988 of 600,000.As if the conflict over national borders,between rival political elites and over the distribu-
tion of resources was not enough to cause blood-
shed, this vast region’s ethnic and religious
conﬂicts added to the general turmoil. Chineseand Indians have settled throughout south-eastAsia. In Singapore the Chinese form the majority.
In Malaysia, a Chinese communist insurrection
was suppressed before independence was gained in
1963. The Tamils in Sri Lanka have continued inarmed rebellion against the Sinhalese majority fordecades, Indian intervention in 1987–8 to force
the Tamils to surrender having failed. India itself
faces severe problems in the Punjab, where
extremist Sikhs demand their own state. In Burma
a number of minorities turned to insurgency. Thetraditional rivalry between China and Vietnam hasled to the Vietnamese treating their Chinese
minority harshly. In the Philippines a Muslim sep-
aratist movement has grown into a major rebel-
lion. Almost every independent south-east Asiannation has not one but several minority problems.For more than half a century, these conﬂicts have
continued unabated.Cold War competition between the SovietUnion, China and the US turned regional con-
flicts into devastating warfare in Vietnam,Cambodia and Laos. China and the Soviet Unionsought to advance their inﬂuence as well as to
keep each other and the Americans out, providing
weapons to rival groups of Laotian, Cambodian,
North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese. TheAmericans alone among the major powers joinedin the wars of Vietnam with combat troops. Cold
War rivalries were thus superimposed on the
already existing internal and intra-regional strug-590TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
gles of south-east Asia. Millions suffered the cata-strophic consequences.The majority of the nations in south-east Asiawere ruled by authoritarian systems of govern-ment. The very nature of Dutch and French colo-
nialism, aggravated by the interlude of Japanese
military occupation, meant that democracy and
constitutional government, regular elections, anindependent judiciary and basic civil freedoms,including free expression and a free press, had
shallow roots. The British Empire in Asia, on theother hand, with the exception of Malaya andBurma, was spared the Japanese occupation.
British colonial rule was the most enlightened,
introducing some of the essential features of con-
stitutional government. The Republic of India is1TURMOIL, WAR AND BLOODSHED IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA591

But Sri Lanka,
despite a parliamentary system, is rent by civil war
which was reaching exhaustion in 2005. Burma,
Pakistan and Bangladesh fell under authoritarianrule, and the whole of former French Indo-China,after nearly thirty years of war, had succumbed to
communism.Despite widespread poverty and its manifoldproblems, it is remarkable that the greater part of
south-east Asia has not proved fertile ground for
the Chinese or Soviet communist models. There
are good reasons for this. Tradition still has a ﬁrm
hold in the region, which is pervaded by especially
strong religious beliefs opposed to atheistic com-
munism. And the nationalism of south-east Asiancountries had to assert itself first against theEuropeans, then against the Japanese and ﬁnally
against the Europeans again. Another disadvan-
tage for communism was that for a time after
1949 the only Asian great power remaining was
Red China. The newly independent states did not
want to fall into the hands of a new Chinese
empire, a threat made all the more real by large
minorities of ‘overseas Chinese’ who might act as
an internally disruptive force. In the continuous
internal struggles for power, furthermore, the
leaders of coups were reluctant to alienate the
most inﬂuential sectors of society – the middle
classes and the propertied. Fundamental redistri-bution of wealth and agrarian reform, let alonemoves towards full-blown communism, would
have stirred up a hornet’s nest of opposition. In
this respect, as well as in many others, Burma was
something of an exception.No sooner had independence come to Burma inJanuary 1948 than internal disruption threatened
to plunge the country into chaos. The British had
left behind a democratic constitution modelled
on Westminster, which proved unsuitable for a
country so underdeveloped and so disorganised.
At the time of independence, Burma was led by
U Nu, an outstanding politician who managed tomaintain constitutional democracy intact for tenyears until 1958. It had barely survived the ﬁrstfour years, during which ethnic minorities andtwo communist groups, the Red Flags and theWhite Flags, collaborated and took control of
central and most of southern Burma, nearly cap-
turing Rangoon. U Nu and constitutional gov-
ernment were saved by the army and General Ne
Win, and by the disunity of the insurgent groups,
who hated each other as much as the system they
were trying to overthrow. To this day, no gov-
ernment has achieved effective control over all the
remote areas of Burma.In the wider world Burma was almost un-known except for two circumstances: U Thant,
the Burmese educator and diplomat (U is an hon-
oriﬁc title meaning ‘honourable sir’), was twiceelected United Nations secretary-general, in 1962and 1966, and served ably until 1971, during a
period of severe conflict in the Third World.
Burma’s more negative contribution has been the
illicit trafﬁc of opium out of the ‘golden triangle’,
a tongue of remote territory spanning Burma,
Laos and Cambodia.The Burmese military was at ﬁrst prepared tosupport the constitutional government of U Nu,
who was carefully edging Burma away from the
West to a neutralist position. Burma had either to
secure India’s ﬁrm backing or to establish good
relations with its most powerful neighbour China,
with which it shared a long frontier. It was thelatter policy which, in the end, proved the onlyfeasible one, unless Burma were to be caught up
in the Cold War. Potentially a rich country, with
resources of rice that had once made it Asia’s
biggest exporter of the grain, not to mention
timber and minerals, Burma’s development never-
theless languished under U Nu’s regime. One
reason continues to be the protracted ethnic con-
ﬂict; another was the failure of over-ambitious
development plans recommended by American
advisers. In 1958 the state of the country had
become so serious that U Nu handed over power
to his supporter, General Ne Win. Two years later
Ne Win organised a general election from whichU Nu emerged victorious, and Ne Win restoredhim to power. But having tasted supreme power,
and seeing the unity of the country once more
threatened, Ne Win in 1962 overthrew U Nu in592TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
a bloodless coup and abolished the constitution,convinced that only authoritarian socialism couldsave his country. He ruled Burma for the next
twenty-six years, introducing a communist-style
one-party (Burma Socialist Programme Party)
authoritarian regime. Keen to ﬁnd a Burmese wayto socialism opposed to both communist insur-gency and U Nu’s liberalism, Ne Win claimed to
be following a middle way in the true Buddhist
fashion. The military junta under his leadership
isolated Burma, forcing it to turn its back on
Western traditions. Industry and banking werenationalised, but the economy performed disas-trously. In an attempt to get it moving Ne Win
secured large development funds from abroad and
the Burmese overseas debt soared from $231
million in 1973 to $3.8 billion in 1988. The stan-dard of living, however, remained one of thelowest in Asia. The rice grown is hardly sufﬁcient
to feed its own population of 48 million.The patient people of Burma, who had suf-fered for twenty-ﬁve years from the Burmese roadto socialism, began to give vent to their frustra-tion in largely student-led riots in Rangoon in
September 1987. The 77-year-old General Ne
Win decided to move to the sidelines and
resigned in the summer of 1988 amid signs of
military disaffection. Reforms were promised. Fora brief period with a civilian as its leader, detaineesreleased and free elections promised, it looked as
if Burma would move out of its self-imposed iso-
lation and darkness. But just a month later, in
September 1988, the military took over andGeneral Saw Maung emerged at the head of ajunta. The ‘restoration of law and order’ marked
the beginnings of a repression against students
and dissidents, brutal even by Burmese standards.
As many as 3,000 pro-democracy demonstrators
are believed to have been massacred.In 1989 the name of Burma was changed toMyanmar, a transliteration of the English ‘Burma’
into Burmese. Surprisingly the new military
leaders promised that new political parties could
register and that there would be free elections inMay 1990. But they then, in the summer, placedunder house arrest the most likely leaders of any
opposition, including Aung San Suu Kyi, the
daughter of Aung San (who played a crucial roleat the birth of Burmese independence) and wifeof an English lecturer at Oxford. Suu Kyi hadreturned to her native land to lead a new party,
the National League for Democracy. It was her
criticisms of Ne Win and her call for justice and
democracy that led to her arrest. But to thechagrin of the junta, which had ﬁelded its ownfront party, the National Unity Party, the
National League for Democracy gained a clear
and outright victory at the 1990 election,
winning a huge majority in the Assembly. The
military junta had no intention of bowing to thisverdict. In 1992 Aung San Suu Kyi remainedunder house arrest. The military declared that
they would release her only if she left the country,
which she has refused to do. For her courage and
her adherence to her principles she was awardedthe Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. There were nosigns in 2005 that the junta planned to hand
power over to a democratic majority. Instead, its
oppressive rule continued, and campaigners
against ethnic minorities, students and rebellioustribes on the north-west and north-east bordersof Myanmar were ﬁercely pursued. A new cam-
paign against Muslim groups in the south-west
led to a ﬂood of refugees escaping to Bangladesh.
But, despite its appalling human rights records,
Myanmar was not shunned by the internationalcommunity, which valued its resources and itsmarket. Oil companies were prospecting and con-
cluding joint production agreements, and the
country was being opened increasingly to foreign
investment. Trade with Thailand grew with par-ticular rapidity. Aung San Suu Kyi’s rearrest aftera period of ‘dialogue’ ﬁnally led the US to try 
to lead an international trade embargo. If the
Burmese people were free, Aung Suu Kyi would
lead a return to representative rule and an end to
the military dictatorship. It was the general’s feel-ings of insecurity after Aung Suu Kyi’s obviouslypopular public reception that decided them to
ensure her disappearance from public view. From
time to time the Junta tried to negotiate releas-
ing Aung San Suu Kyi but never gave up power.Indonesia is the largest country in south-east Asia,with more inhabitants than Britain and united

islands, extending over 3,000 miles of ocean fromeast to west, that has captured the popular imag-
ination is Bali. The great majority of the people
are Muslims, but there are many ethnic groups,
and the unity of this far-ﬂung nation of islands isbased on centuries of Dutch empire buildingrather than on the homogeneity of the people or
on common attitudes. Two men held continuous
power from independence in 1949 to the mid-
1980s, Achmed Sukarno and General Suharto.
Following independence, constitutional govern-ment lasted only until 1958. At least outwardly ithad been based on Western parliamentary
models, but Sukarno, the ﬁrst president, chafed
under its restrictions and used the army to under-
mine parliamentary and political development.Parliamentary-style government had not workedwell. None of the then existing four parties,
including the Communist Party, the largest in
south-east Asia, had been able to establish a com-
manding lead. Uneasy coalition governments reg-
ularly fell apart. The loyalties of the populationwere in any case regional and local. Sukarno hadto cope with a series of rebellions in the outer
islands, and in 1958 with a military insurgency in
Sumatra. Political rivalry and widespread corrup-
tion did nothing to foster national pride.Sukarno attempted to fashion a national image,an Indonesian identity that increasingly rejected
the West. The constitutional façade had at least
served the purpose of encouraging Western devel-
opment aid, as in 1952 when Indonesia partici-pated in the Commonwealth Colombo Plan.Sukarno accepted Western aid and in 1960 Soviet
assistance as well. Championing a Third Worldapproach to global problems, he hosted in 1955the Afro-Asian Bandung Conference, attended byNehru and Zhou Enlai, but it was regarded with
great suspicion in Washington, where a stance of
non-alignment was interpreted as anti-Western
and pro-communist. Sukarno’s rule was supportedby both the Communist Party and the anti-communist army. Although Khrushchev saw an
opportunity to extend Soviet inﬂuence, neither
Moscow nor Washington knew how to assess
Sukarno’s Indonesia, as he cleverly played the
Cold War game, beneﬁting from both sides.In 1958 Sukarno moved to an authoritarianform of government, within a short time stiﬂing
the inﬂuence of constitutional safeguards such as
the elected parliament, the political parties, the
independent judiciary and the press. He becamethe supreme leader of his ‘guided democracy’.Meanwhile, two powerful factions watched each
other warily, the communists and the military.
Most of the military approved of Sukarno’s coup.
Then, in October 1965, in what was the most vio-lent convulsion in Indonesian politics, the com-munists murdered six generals. What really
occurred has never been properly clariﬁed. Was it
really the beginning of an attempted communist
coup? The army reacted with savagery and staged
its own coup against Sukarno. General Suharto,one of those not on the assassination list, emergedas Indonesia’s strongman. Over the next few
months communist supporters were killed in a
bloodbath that may have seen more than half a
million dead. Suharto effectively took control,though Sukarno remained president until replacedby Suharto.In world affairs Sukarno had emerged as acharismatic Third World leader, loud in his
denunciation of Western imperialism and strident
in promoting Indonesian nationalism. Thisimpeded economic development as he tried torun Indonesia without Dutch technical assistance.
Later efforts to encourage Dutch and inter-

national investment foundered in the face of his
conﬂict with the Dutch over the future of thewestern part of New Guinea, West Irian, whichthe Dutch did not cede until 1963.In south-east Asia Sukarno pursued expan-
sionist policies, in particular adopting a stance of594TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949

confrontation with Malaysia. He denounced theMalaysian Federation as a Western colonialoutpost. For a time in 1963 and 1964, with
Indonesia promoting armed incidents, there
seemed to be a real threat of war between the two
countries. Hastily assembled Commonwealthtroops, British, Australian, New Zealand andMalaysian, set up an effective defence force that
deterred Sukarno from further provocation.
Suharto’s military coup of 1965 was nonetheless
greeted with relief by the West.General Suharto and the military had viru-lently opposed the communists long before they massacred hundreds of thousands of them on
taking control of the country in October 1965.
Reﬂecting this opposition internationally, Suharto
dropped Sukarno’s friendships with China andthe Soviet Union and reorientated to the West.With fears prompted by the Vietnam conﬂict of a
communist takeover of the whole of south-east
Asia, the US supplanted the Soviet Union as the
arms supplier and provider of foreign aid toIndonesia. The country was opened to Westernenterprise, but, despite its plentiful resources and
even though in the 1970s it became the largest
oil producer in Asia, corruption and inefﬁciency
marred its economic development, so that it
remained a poor Third World country. State plan-ning largely failed to remedy the gross disparitybetween the wealth of a minority and the poverty
of the majority; loans were not properly applied;
and Indonesia’s foreign debt rose enormously,
swallowing up nearly a third of all export earn-ings in 1991, despite considerable expansion ofoil and gas exports in the 1980s. In the late 1980s
the regime began a policy of liberalisation from
state control.In external affairs, Indonesia’s relations with itsMalaysian neighbours and with Singapore weregenerally easier than they had been duringSukarno’s era. Indonesia is a member of the
Association of South-East Asian Nations, which,
although not a well-functioning organisation, has
done something to promote trade and peace. Atthe end of the 1980s Indonesia also played a morepositive role internationally in helping to broker
the peace agreement ﬁnally reached in Cambodia.
But General Suharto did not abandon Indonesianexpansionism. Among the worst atrocities insouth-east Asian history was Indonesia’s invasionof East Timor, which the Portuguese had left in
December 1975. The invaders crushed the move-
ment for an independent East Timor with such
brutality that a ﬁfth of the population of some700,000 were either killed or disappeared.Nonetheless, independence as an ideal was not
abandoned by the politically active in East Timor.
Attention was once more focused on Indonesia’s
military when a peaceful demonstration on 28
October 1991 led to the killing of many demon-strators, amid worldwide condemnation. WithinIndonesia, insurgencies on some of the islands
were no less brutally suppressed, with the tacit
support of the majority, who preferred military
rule to continual strife and bloodshed provokedby the minority insurgents.Suharto’s military rule allowed no oppositionor constitutional development, nor did his mod-
iﬁcation of Sukarno’s ‘guided democracy’ liber-
alise the authoritarian government of the country.All effective power was concentrated in his hands,and even the discarding of his uniform could not
disguise the truth that his rule was based on mil-
itary force. Periodically ‘re-elected’ as president
by a carefully controlled and largely ceremonial
parliament, he brought a certain stability after thehectic Sukarno years. But the increasing wealth ofa small middle class and the rising discontent of
students occasioned a questioning of authoritar-
ian rule. Here, as in the rest of Asia, the wind of
change was blowing, albeit very gently.Stability and national unity were the watch-
words of the junta, repression the means of achiev-

ing them, whether combating communism,
(non-Indonesian) nationalism or the demands of
fundamental Muslim groups. That strategy left lit-

tle scope for the development of civilian demo-
cratic rule. The stability provided by an authori-tarian military regime also encouraged the devel-

oped world to invest in Indonesia. In the early
1990s President Suharto and the army attempted
to present a more liberal image to the outsideworld by allowing some political activity and try-ing to appease more moderate Muslims after 
years of preventing Islam from playing any role 
in state politics. These were but small beginnings.1TURMOIL, WAR AND BLOODSHED IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA595
Throughout south-east Asia the economic crash of1997 threatened political stability and authoritar-
ian leaders. One of the worst affected by the eco-

nomic debacle was Indonesia. Public anger turned
on Suharto and his corruption and nepotism. In
May 1998 he was forced out of ofﬁce. The elected
regimes following Suharto’s fall were unable tomaster the turbulence into which Indonesia
descended. After the fall of Suharto, the old, half-
paralysed vice-president, B. J. Habibie became
president. The elections of 1999 removed from
power the Golkar Party, the subservient supportersof the corrupt Suharto and of Habibie with closeties to the powerful military. A new era appeared to
open with the victory of the supporters of
Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Sukarno the
founder of Indonesia. Megawati has been cautiousin adopting fundamental economic anddemocratic
reforms to rid the country of corruption. Golkar
remained a power in the land. Trying to govern the
largest Muslim country in the world riddled with
ethnic and religious strife and regions ﬁghting for independence at the same time as with an econ-
omy trying to recover from meltdown is not a
good opening for the new democracy. Megawati,
aloof in public contact, is no charismatic leader.Indonesia is an overwhelmingly moderateMuslim country but radical Islam has madeinroads. There are likely links between extremistterrorist groups and al-Qaeda. An attack on a
night club frequented by Westerners in the tourist
paradise of Bali on 12 October 2002 killed an
estimated 190 young men and women, almosthalf of whom had come from Australia. Megawatihas not cracked down on radical Muslim groups
although emergency powers are in place. Her
judgement is that this would only add to the strife
in her country.Megawati was ousted in October 2004 at theﬁrst direct presidential elections. Indonesia hasbecome a vibrant democracy with 80 per cent
casting their vote. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a
retired general, was elected. Daunting challenges
face him: slow economic growth, high unem-ployment, corruption, ethnic violence in Acehand Papua and the threat of militant Muslim ter-
rorism. But with huge resources there are
prospects for a better future for the people.World attention was drawn to Indonesia in 1999when people of East Timor were promised byHabibie a plebiscite to decide on whether to
remain in Indonesia or become independent. A
guerrilla movement had struggled for independ-
ence since the invasion of the former Portuguesecolony by the Indonesian marines on 7 December1975. The harsh struggle had cost thousands of
lives. When the new, elected government of
Indonesia, twenty-four years later in September
1999, offered the plebiscite organised by the UN,
the people of East Timor voted by a large major-
ity for their independence. The consequence wasa rampage of destruction and killings by militia
organised by the Indonesian army out of Jakarta’s
control. A quarter of the population of about
800,000 ﬂed, a few found refuge in the UN com-pound guarded by the helpless UN monitors. Thecapital Dili was practically razed to the ground. It
is estimated that as many as 200,000 may have
lost their lives. Television broadcasts spread news
of the horror around the world and galvanised themembers of the United Nations. An Australian-led UN peacekeeping force restored order and the
UN set up a transitional administration. For
Habibie the East Timor disaster was the nail in
the coffin for his presidential hopes of being
elected. For East Timor it was a new beginning.Reconstruction was assisted by able UN-appointed administrators and by ﬁnancial aid to

help the people living at little more than subsis-
tence level. The early years of independence 
were fraught with difﬁculty. The minority of EastTimorese who supported the Indonesians fled to West Timor. Democratic politics are in their
infancy after a constitution was framed and elec-
tions in 2001. The president and one time leader of
the independence struggle José Gusmáo is a widely
respected force for moderation but shares powerwith a prime minister of far more radical bent. InMay 2002 the transitional administration came to
an end and East Timor gained its full indendence.
Its current poverty will be transformed when the
Australian–East Timor agreement to exploit the oil and gas in the offshore ﬁelds of the Timor Gapbrings rich royalties to the nation. It must not be
dissipated like the oil riches of Nigeria if East
Timor is to develop over the next generation.596TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
East Timor’s success in breaking away fromIndonesia encouraged other independent move-ments. The longest running and most serious is 
on the province of Aceh inhabited by 4.3 million
people on the most north-westerly tip of Sumatra.
It has gone on as long as East Timor’s struggle,with an active guerrilla movement. Ceasefires have come and gone. The military are determined
to resist complete independence and the resistance
will accept nothing less. In 2003 the army once
more resorted to force with tanks and bombers.Strongman rule like Suharto’s bred corruption,economic decline and human rights abuses. In themore recent democratic era there have been
ethnic clashes, violence, attempted bloody sup-
pression and weak leadership. There is no national
consensus on Indonesia’s future.Without British and Commonwealth supportMalaysia, with its relatively small population,
could not have stood up to Indonesian pressure
in the early 1960s, though its resources of rubber,tin and timber make it one of the wealthiest coun-tries of south-east Asia. Like some other former
British colonies, Malaysia followed a constitu-
tional, democratic path after attaining independ-
ence in 1957, but it faced severe problems of
national unity from the start. The feudal Malayprinces were jealous of their ceremonial powers.Worse still, the country was divided into three
distinct ethnic groups: the Malays formed the
majority, but the Chinese, who were almost as
numerous, were the wealthiest and most dynamicgroup; third, there was a relatively small group ofethnic Indians. The solution was to share power
between all three in an Alliance Party. It was
dominated by the most distinguished statesman
Malaya had produced, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the
father of independence.A conservative but tolerant prime ministerfrom 1957 to 1970, Abdul Rahman upheld
democratic and constitutional government and
supported an independent judiciary and a free
press. Nevertheless, the tension between theMalays and the Chinese could not always be con-tained. The policies designed to compensate the
Malays for their disadvantaged position bred
resentment among the Chinese. Communal riotsforced on the country two brief emergencieswhen democratic rights were suspended. But,even with renewed communist insurgencies after
the communist victories in Vietnam in 1975,
there was always a return to constitutional gov-
ernment and free elections.The differences between the Chinese andMalays also led to the break-up of an expanded
Federation of Malaysia, which included the two
North Bornean colonies and Singapore. The
Chinese predominated in Singapore, and the party
working for independence, the People’s ActionParty, was led by Lee Kuan Yew, who originallysuggested to Abdul Rahman the plan for the fed-
eration of the territories. It came into being in
1963, and Britain transferred to it control of
Singapore and the two North Bornean territories.The Philippines protested and put forward theirown claims to North Borneo. More serious was
the confrontation with Indonesia. Between 1964
and 1965 ﬁghting sporadically broke out as the
federation moved to defend its territories.In 1965 Lee Kuan Yew withdrew Singaporefrom the Malaysian Federation to form an inde-pendent republic within the Commonwealth.
Thereafter he won every election until his retire-
ment in 1990. His authoritarian paternalism
signiﬁcantly interfered with constitutional gov-

ernment, while his puritanism kept Singapore sin-gularly free from crime, drugs and sexual licence,which he regarded as decadent features of the
Western way of life. Without natural resources,
except ﬁsh, Singapore has been transformed into
the ﬁnancial and industrial centre of south-east
Asia, its population of 2.5 million enjoying thehighest standard of living in the region (with theexception of the fortunate people of Brunei,
whose wealth comes not from their work but
from oil). In these respects it compares with
Hong Kong. Singapore demonstrates the aston-
ishing rise from poverty that has transformed thecountries of the Pacific Rim since 1945 –Singapore, Taiwan, Japan (the economic super-
power) and South Korea.Malaysian wealth depends more on the worldprices of its natural resources. With its ﬁne educa-
tional system and well-trained, British-orientedjudiciary, the roots of democratic government1TURMOIL, WAR AND BLOODSHED IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA597
seemed to have struck more deeply here than else-
where in the region. With the Alliance Party in dis-
array, Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister since
1981, claimed that the communist and Chinese
threat in the early 1990s required increasing vigilance. In 1987 he invoked a security act toimprison many opponents. More ominously, he
harassed and weakened the judiciary and so placeda question mark over Malaysia’s democratic consti-
tutional future. By 1993 repression had not
resulted in a serious Chinese backlash; but, even if
there were one, the great majority of ChineseMalays would not support the Chinese orVietnamese communists in the north. Dr Mahathir
retained control throughout the crisis of 1997 and
1998, blaming it on the West instead of on theimprudent spending of Malayan business. But theWest was, in part, to blame for recklessly supplying
loans for unproductive development. As time went
on, Dr Mahathir become more authoritarian, hislast years were marred by the abuses of the judicialprocess as he sought to imprison those who
opposed him or fell out with him over policy. The
most notorious case was the conviction of the mostlikely successor to Mahathir, Anwar Ibrahim, con-
victed in 1999 of corruption and sodomy and sen-

tenced to six and nine years in prison. His wife now
leads an opposition movement. After twenty-twoyears in power, Mahathir announced with tears inhis eyes his intentions to retire and did so in
October 2003. There are elections but democracy
is flawed when emergency legislation can beinvoked to detain active politicians in opposition.In many ways Malaysia is a remarkable country;Muslim and secular, tolerant of all religions and,
during the last two decades, successfully over-coming the dangers of ethnic conﬂict between thewealthier Chinese community and the Malays,
unlike what occurred in Indonesia in 1998. The
Malays make up just over half of the 23 millionpopulation, the Chinese about a quarter andIndians less than ten per cent. Positive discrimina-
tion has raised the educational level and standard
of living of the Malays. The cloud over the future is the spread of more militant Islam whichDr Mahathir with some concessions succeeded in
containing. Malaysia is not yet a fully developednation, the majority of its people are still only onthe path to becoming the ‘fully developed coun-try’ in Mahathir’s ‘Vision 2020’ that he set out as a goal in 1992. Mahathir’s chosen successor,Abdullah Badawi, his deputy prime minister, lacks
his authority and style. In facing Malaysia’s future,
Mahathir’s premiership will be a hard act to followdespite all its shortcomings.Siam, renamed Thailand in 1949, is one of theﬁve relatively prosperous states of south-east Asia,the others being Singapore, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Sri Lanka. With a population of
over 50 million in the 1980s, Thailand possessesrich resources, principally tin, wolfram, rubberand rice. In the capital, Bangkok, a downtown
commercial centre and some factories stand cheek
by jowl along its hundreds of canals with shantydwellings lacking sanitation. In the West and inJapan, Thailand achieved notoriety for encourag-
ing tourists attracted by the unrestricted nature of
its prostitution, which catered for all varieties ofWestern and Eastern tastes. AIDS is now rampantin the sex bazaars, threatening the lucrative
tourism and, worse, the country’s population.
Every new ruler and government promised toclean up Thailand, referring not to this specialisedtourism, but to widespread administrative cor-

ruption. Thailand is a monarchy, but power is
exercised by a group of generals who periodicallyengage in coups against each other. By 1993there had been six such successful coups since
1945 and numerous unsuccessful attempts. On
three occasions the military handed the govern-ment back to civilian control, but never for verylong. Consequently, parliamentary democracy
had little opportunity to develop.Thailand and Japan were the only Asian coun-tries to escape colonisation by one of theEuropean powers, but Thailand lost some of its
territory in the nineteenth century to Laos and
Cambodia, then French Indo-China. Thailand’sgeographical position poses particular problemsfor its foreign policy, for it cannot afford too many
enemies simultaneously. It has borders with 
ﬁve countries. To the north and west lies Burma,with which it cultivates good relations. To thesouth-west is Malaysia, with which it shares anti-
communist interests and a desire to avoid beingdrawn into war. Thailand’s problems emerge onits north-eastern borders with Laos and its south-598TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
eastern borders with Cambodia, both of whichcountries were threatened with communist insur-gencies in the 1960s. A communist (Pathet Lao)
takeover of Laos with North Vietnamese support
was a particular danger, as there are about threetimes as many Laotian-speaking inhabitants withinThailand (more than 8 million) as in Laos itself.
Thailand provided support and bases for UStroops in the Vietnam War during the 1960s, butwas critical of America’s reluctance to ﬁght com-
munism in Laos with determination. It viewed the
international agreement to neutralise Laos in1962 as merely a step in the direction of a com-plete communist takeover.Thailand’s worst fears were realised in 1973when the US pulled out of the war in Vietnam;two years later communism was victorious inVietnam, Cambodia and Laos. But in the 1980s
civil wars continued to be fought in neighbouring
Cambodia, with most of the country occupieduntil 1989 by Vietnam. In the early 1990sThailand found itself the unenthusiastic host of
some 400,000 refugees who had crossed its east-
ern borders, though its borders remained secure.The US in SEATO (1955) and subsequent decla-rations pledged itself to defend Thailand, but in
1976 as part of a general withdrawal from south-
east Asia gave up its Thai bases. A leading memberof ASEAN, the Association of South-East AsianNations, founded in 1967, Thailand hoped with
its four partners, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia
and the Philippines, to maintain the existingpeace. But its best protection was an unexpectedone: the disunity, confusion and, latterly, collapse
in the communist world.Of all countries involved in civil wars, bloodshedand great-power conﬂicts, no country, not even
Vietnam, suffered as much as Cambodia. Under
Japanese control from 1941 to 1945 the countrycame into being on the eve of Japan’s defeat inMarch 1945, when King Norodom Sihanouk
proclaimed Cambodia’s independence. After the
French had returned, Sihanouk placed himself atthe head of the national movement and succeededin extracting full French independence for his
small kingdom (5 million inhabitants in 1954).By then the king had to contend with commu-nist rivals supported by the North Vietnamese.Sihanouk attempted to rescue the country bycreating a neutralist coalition, which might alsohelp prevent internal rivalries from wrenching the
country apart. From 1945 to 1970 he was the
most respected Cambodian politician, and inorder to play an effective part in politics he tookthe unusual step of giving up his throne to his
father. He then (1955) presented himself ashumble Mr Sihanouk, though he continued to beknown as ‘Prince’.Realising early on that North Vietnam and thePathet Lao were likely to prove the stronger in thewar, he abandoned America and the West to seekthe friendship of China in the 1960s. He was pow-
erless to prevent the North Vietnamese from using
the Ho Chi-minh trail in Cambodian border terri-tories for moving troops and supplies from thecommunist North to South Vietnam. But his pro-
Chinese, pro-communist stance was unwelcome to

the US, and while in Beijing in 1970 he was over-thrown; with American support, Lon Nol tookcontrol of the royal government in Cambodia’s
capital, Phnom Penh. This marked the end of any
hope that Cambodia might achieve neutrality: itwas invaded by American and South Vietnamesetroops intent on destroying the Vietnamese com-
munist bases and supply lines on the borders,
which were also bombed. In Beijing, Sihanouknow threw in his lot with the Khmer Rouge com-munist opposition. American policy in Cambodia
proved a disastrous failure, and after the US with-
drawal from Vietnam in 1973 there was no possi-bility that Congress would have accepted a newmilitary commitment in Cambodia. Deprived of
US combat support, the Lon Nol regime could
not survive the onslaught of communist forces, sowhen the Americans ﬁnally left, the Khmer Rougeeasily captured Phnom Penh in April 1975 and
took over the whole country.Had the Americans not turned againstSihanouk, one of the cleverest and wiliest ofsouth-east Asian leaders, Cambodia might have
been spared the almost unbelievable horrors that
followed. Sihanouk was now practically a prisonerin Khmer Rouge hands; for a short while heserved as a useful ﬁgurehead, but the infamous
Khmer Rouge leader, known as Pol Pot, wieldedtotal power. He forced the inhabitants of PhnomPenh to march into the countryside, where most1TURMOIL, WAR AND BLOODSHED IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA599
of the helpless urban population perished. A cam-paign of genocide was directed against all intel-lectuals and educated Cambodians who might
have resisted his fanatical communist regime. No
one knows exactly how many hundreds of thou-sands perished in the notorious killing ﬁelds, nowpreserved as national shrines. Possibly it was as
many as 2 million, but up to one-third of the pop-ulation has disappeared; Cambodia’s populationdeclined from some 7.5 to 5.5 million.To satisfy their own ambitions the communistVietnamese put an end to Pol Pot’s bloodthirsty
regime by invading Cambodia, which had been
renamed Kampuchea, in December 1978 and set-ting up a government under their control. A largeVietnamese army occupied most of the country
until 1989, when the invaders at last withdrew. It
had proved a costly intervention, and the puppet
regime was not recognised by the West. It was
true that the Vietnamese could not but be animmense improvement on Pol Pot’s murderers,but south-east Asia’s non-communist countries
fear a powerful Vietnam far more than they fear
the Khmer Rouge. Disgracefully, the Khmer
Rouge, part of the Khmer People’s National
Liberation Front, were for a long time recognisedas representing Kampuchea at the United Nations.The search for a peaceful settlement inKampuchea was long and arduous. The opportu-
nity arose only with the ending of the Cold War.
It was now also in China’s and Russia’s interests to
liquidate the civil war in Kampuchea. In January1990 an Australian peace plan was accepted as abasis for a settlement by the ﬁve permanent mem-
bers of the UN Security Council, including of
course the former Cold War contestants, the US,
China and the Soviet Union. A peace accord
between the Kampuchean factions brokered bythe United Nations was subsequently signed inParis on 23 October 1991. It would allow the
genocidal Khmer Rouge to participate in a transi-
tional administration called the Supreme National
Council. Some 400,000 refugees on the Thai–
Kampuchean border were to return home, andthey would swell the support the Khmer Rougecould claim.In 1991 Prince Sihanouk returned to hispalace in Phnom Penh and an advance party ofUN ofﬁcials arrived. The United Nations took ona supervisory role as ‘transitional authority’ to run
the main ministries, enforce an arms embargo andensure the demobilisation of the rival armies – the35,000 Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the 18,000-
strong Sihanouk National Army and 8,000 troops
of the anti-communist National Liberation Front,
who together formed the ‘national resistance
coalition’. The UN held elections in 1993 but the
Khmer Rouge refused to participate. A huge
international peace effort, which required funding
by the wealthier nations to the tune of over $2
billion, 16,000 UN troops and 5,000 civilians,
was undertaken under the auspices of a UN ‘tran-sitional authority’. The two largest parties cameto a power-sharing agreement with two co-prime
members until July 1997 when their power strug-
gle ended in ﬁghting in Phnom Penh, the royal-
ist Norodom Ranaddh was driven out and Hun
Sen and the People’s Party assumed sole power.
The events illustrated once again how despite a
tremendous international effort, democracy and
representative government cannot simply be
imposed from above where the culture andhistory is so alien to it. It can only be nurturedover a longer time span. But Cambodia has
become more stable. After Pol Pot’s death in
1998, the Khmer Rouge ceased as an effective
opposition military force. To overcome inter-

national criticism Hun Sen held new elections in
1998, a coalition was formed again with the roy-
alists but Hun Sen remained in ﬁrm control. The
people remain attached to their old king who
chose to live in Beijing advising his countrymen
from afar. A country of great contradictions,Kampuchea is a communist kingdom.600TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949

Nowhere was human suffering greater in Asiathan during the 1960s and 1970s in the lands ofVietnam, Cambodia and Laos. The Vietnam War
was a fratricidal conﬂict between the Vietnamese
people. It also marked the climax of the Cold War
in Asia, which hugely increased the suffering of
the indigenous peoples. Because American leadersbelieved that far more was at stake than just thefuture of South Vietnam, that the security of the
non-communist world was being tested here in
the jungles and rice-swamps of Asia, they ﬁrst
supplied money and arms and eventually half amillion combat troops in an attempt to help oneside in the Vietnamese Civil War defeat the other.
But America’s Western allies saw it differently, so
there was never the unity displayed during the
Korean War. France and Britain gave advice butsent no troops. In Asia, Australia was the mostenthusiastic supporter and, with New Zealand,
despatched several thousand men; other small
token allies that sent some troops were Thailand
and the Philippines. The Russians and Chinese
gave aid and arms to the communists to supporttheir ﬁght but were careful to keep out of combatthemselves. The Chinese communists did not
want America on their southern frontier; they had
already fought in North Korea to keep the enemy
from their northern Manchurian border. It suitedthe Russians, on the other hand, to see Americaquagmired in south-east Asia, far away from
regions bordering on the Soviet Union.The ordinary people, mostly peasants inVietnam, followed their leaders either throughconviction or because they had no choice, con-scripted and coerced into rival armies or units ofirregular combatants. In Vietnam resistance was
punished by death. Only in a Western democ-
racy was public protest possible. Most young
Americans accepted their call-up, but there were
tens of thousands who did not view the Vietnamconﬂict as necessary or just and avoided the draft.In the US the war became increasingly unaccept-
able after 1968, with its heavy losses of American
life. With the progressive US disengagement on
land, the Vietnamese were left to ﬁght to theﬁnish. The communist forces were the stronger,and they would have won the war between the
Vietnamese with less loss of life and destruction
had the US not intervened. The Johnson admin-
istration failed to grasp the true nature of the con-ﬂict it was facing.The Vietnam War was also a tragedy for theUS, for the parents of the 58,200 men killed, for
the wives who saw husbands returned in body-
bags, for the more than 300,000 wounded ser-
vicemen whose scars were not only physical. Itwas a war fought by 19-year-old American con-scripts in rice-ﬁelds and jungles. The enemy was
everywhere and not necessarily recognisable by
his uniform. There was nothing to distinguish the
Vietcong ﬁghter from unarmed peasants, men,women and even children. In fear of their ownlives, the US troops shot ﬁrst, at anyone who ran
away from them or who even looked suspicious;
atrocities were committed, villages burnt, inno-
cent and guilty killed. The Americans’ South1Chapter 55THE VIETNAM WAR AND AFTER
Vietnamese allies had even less regard for the livesof those of their fellow countrymen who wereassisting the Vietcong and Vietminh. It was a bru-
talising war even by the standards of the twenti-
eth century.The losses the Americans suffered were smallin comparison with those of the Vietnamesepeople. The scale of death, crippling injury and
destruction in Vietnam was so great it is difﬁcult
for Westerners to grasp how any people could
have tenaciously gone on ﬁghting. That was the
prime error made by the American generals, whowith superior weapons thought they were ﬁght-ing a war of attrition. Since America’s goal was
not to win a total victory but ‘only’ to force the
North Vietnamese communists to abandon their
efforts to occupy the central and southern regionsof Vietnam, it seemed to any Westerner that apoint would be reached when the leaders of the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam would accept
that the price of extending their rule over the
centre and south was too high in human lives andmaterial destruction.The cruelties of the Vietnam conﬂict plumbedthe depths of human conduct – prisoners were
tortured by both sides, and in practice the Geneva
Convention on warfare counted for nothing. The
communist atrocities were largely hidden fromWestern eyes. The freedom of the press in theWest, however, ensured that some idea of the bar-
barities committed by the South Vietnamese
army, and of the effects of American warfare,
reached every sitting room. Two images especiallyetched themselves on the public eye: the execu-tion of a Vietcong suspect, shot in the head by
the chief of police in a street in Hue; and the
spectacle of a naked Vietnamese girl, burnt by
napalm dropped from the air and running scream-
ing towards the camera.The land war in the southern and centralregions of Vietnam that formed the Republic of
Vietnam was fought in rice-ﬁelds and jungle. The
Americans ‘punished’ North Vietnam by starting
in March 1965 a bombing offensive, codenamedRolling Thunder, intended to batter its popula-tion into the Stone Age. More bombs were
dropped on North Vietnam than the Americans
had dropped during the whole of the SecondWorld War. The continuation of a war againstsuch odds, it was believed in Washington, madeno rational sense. Vietnam was pitted with bomb
craters; large areas of jungle were defoliated by a
chemical, ‘agent orange’, in an attempt to reveal
communist hide-outs. The land was poisoned andso were its people.Rational? Ho Chi-minh and his NorthVietnamese Politburo were not ‘rational’ when
measured by Western moral standards. Ho Chi-
minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap were ready
to press into the ﬁght as many hundreds of thou-sands of Vietnamese as might be needed to over-whelm the Americans and the South Vietnamese
army. ‘Body counts’ of Vietnamese did not matter
to them. Vietnamese fertility was high. The only
‘body counts’ that mattered were those of theAmericans, who sooner or later would have toabandon a war being fought in a far-away
country, a war whose outcome was no possible
threat to US security. Whether the war lasted ten
years or forty, Ho Chi-minh knew that theAmericans would not ﬁght for ever. The com-munists did not have to defeat US forces in the
ﬁeld. This they could not do. But, provided they
continued to inﬂict casualties and just prevented
the Americans and their South Vietnamese allies
from winning, the US would in the end leaveVietnam. It was a war of attrition. The Americanpeople’s threshold of acceptable losses, in an
Asian war fought on ideological grounds, was
much lower than their enemy’s. For the Vietminh
it was a ﬁght to the end to free the south fromAmerican imperialism. The death of Ho Chi-minh in September 1969 altered nothing – his
policies continued to be ruthlessly pursued by his
comrades in arms.The price in blood the Vietnamese paid for theirvictory was terrible. Vietnam has issued ﬁgures
starkly revealing the carnage: 1.1 million combat-
ants were killed, 600,000 wounded; the ARVN
(the army of the southern Republic) suffered
nearly 250,000 killed and 600,000 wounded; 2
million civilians were killed and 2 million injured;thus total casualties reached a staggering 6.5 mil-
lion, about one in every seven Vietnamese. If the
same proportions were applied to the population
of the US in 1976, 6 million combatants would602TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
have been killed, with total civilian and militarycasualties amounting to 30 million. Such statisticsbring home to the West the extent of Vietnamese
suffering as a result of the war.The so-called lessons of history are often attheir most dangerous when they are used tojustify the adoption of speciﬁc policies. The failureof the attempts to appease Hitler in the 1930s was
resurrected in circumstances after 1945 that were
very different. The assumption was made that all
dictators behave in exactly the same way, that
their ambitions are always limitless and that con-cessions feed their appetites. There was no need,therefore, to differentiate or even to study the sit-
uation in the area of conﬂict. It did not matter
whether the crisis was occurring in Europe, for
instance in divided Berlin, or in Asia in dividedVietnam. The Cold War wonderfully simpliﬁedeverything in what was perceived as a global
struggle against expanding communism. From
Washington’s standpoint, the real enemy was in
Beijing and Moscow. Here the strings were sup-posed to be pulled, with the smaller communistcountries as mere puppets with no will of their
own. There can be no denying Russia’s and
China’s influence in Vietnam, but it was not
always decisive. The critical decisions were taken
in Hanoi. Moreover, the US could not carry thewar to China or Russia without the danger ofnuclear exchange. So there was no choice but to
ﬁght conventional wars against smaller commu-
nist states that were apparently being pushed
forward into aggression against the free world.Ho Chi-minh transformed North Vietnam into a rigid communist state by stages. Until the 
ﬁghting with the French began, from 1946 to
1949 he played down communism under the
slogan ‘Fatherland all’. Having secured much of the countryside by 1950, a new phase beganunder a fresh slogan, ‘the anti-imperialist ﬁght
and the anti-feudal ﬁght are of equal importance’.
The ‘land reform’ from 1953 to 1956 was model-
led on Mao’s example and ruthlessly eliminat-ed the landlord class, anyone connected with them, and all ‘reactionary elements’. The wave 
of terror took many lives, and after the 1954 
Geneva Conference there was a mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Northto the South.Some of the Vietnamese people were moti-vated by powerful ideological or religious beliefs.
But the majority of the poor peasants would not
have chosen to be ruled harshly by the Com-munist Party in the North or by the succession ofcorrupt governments in the South. As for the
minority – the professionals, the well-off, the
army ofﬁcers, the politicians – they looked after
their own interests or supported what they
regarded as the lesser evil. Vietnam in contempor-ary history is the product not of what the mass ofits people have chosen, but of half a century of
power struggles among the Vietnamese leadership
elites within a Cold War framework.The Geneva Accord had divided Vietnam at the17th parallel. In the southern Republic ofVietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem established an increas-
ingly autocratic and nepotistic regime, distribut-
ing posts to his brothers and relations. He was
supported by the large landowners, which neces-sarily limited the scope of agrarian reforms. Hisregime uprooted millions of peasants and forced
them into ‘strategic hamlets’ to cut their ties with
the Vietcong. The peasants, who wanted only to
get on with their own hard lives, were terrorised in
turn by Vietcong guerrillas and Ngo Dinh Diem’ssecurity forces. Some were attracted by the com-munist promise to distribute land to the peasants,
but most were just afraid for their lives if they did
not comply with whoever was able to exert the
greater pressure at any one time. The peasants didnot feel any loyalty towards the Diem regime.Internal demands for reform were stiﬂed, coup
attempts suppressed. When Buddhists set ﬁre to
themselves to attract attention to their grievances,
the world was aghast, but Diem remained conﬁ-
dent that the US had no alternative but to supporthis anti-communist government.For all Diem’s military efforts and those of theAmerican advisers to ‘pacify’ the countryside, the
Vietcong remained a powerful insurgent force in
the jungles and rice-paddies, despite their heavylosses, concentrating on the killing of SouthVietnamese government ofﬁcials. In 1960, Ho
Chi-minh had formed a National Liberation
Front, to coordinate the ﬁght in the North and1THE VIETNAM WAR AND AFTER603
the South and to try to control the Vietcong, butalthough they needed the supplies from the North,which were passing through the jungle down 
the Ho Chi-minh trail just inside the border, the
Vietcong maintained a separate political identity.In Washington the creation of the NationalLiberation Front conﬁrmed the mistaken beliefthat the conﬂict was in reality with communist
North Vietnam, that there was no separate, inter-
nal South Vietnamese struggle. But, faced with
Diem’s embarrassing autocracy and corruption,
disenchantment had set in. Attacks on Buddhisttemples organised by Diem’s brothers and protestriots in the streets in August 1963 were the last
straw, and Washington withdrew its support from
Diem and his family coterie. A coup by disgrun-
tled generals was in the making. Henry CabotLodge, recently arrived as US ambassador inSaigon, had foreknowledge of it, and his contacts
with the generals encouraged them in the belief
that Diem’s overthrow would be welcome in
Washington. On 1 November 1963 the ofﬁcerswent into action and ousted Diem, who ﬂed fromthe presidential palace. What the Americans had
not anticipated was Diem’s murder the following
day. The junta of feuding army and air force ofﬁ-
cers governed South Vietnam incompetently.
American pressure ensured that some sort of elec-tions were held, but in the war-torn conditions ofthe republic the military ensured that they
retained control.The Vietcong and Vietminh were gettingstronger and gaining support among the peasantsby means of terror, indoctrination and persuasion.Confidence in the corrupt South Vietnamese
regime was waning. In the summer of 1965 the
Americanisation of the war began. Within three
years more than half a million young American
combatants were ﬁghting in Vietnam, and thou-sands had died. American generals more or lesstook over the war. In 1967, by counting all the
communists they killed in hundreds of skirmishes
in rice-ﬁelds and forests and in attacks on villages
by day which supplied the Vietcong by night,they thought they were surely winning the war.But these missions to seek out and kill the enemy
did not bring the conﬂict to an end. American
tactics proved of no avail in the jungles ofVietnam, Cambodia and Laos. A helicoptergunship was not as effective as tens of thousandsof Vietcong and Vietminh, each armed with a riﬂe
and able to live on a daily bowl of rice. It was
impossible to kill them all. Casualties would be
replaced with new recruits, increases in Americancombat troops with increased numbers ofVietminh. The Vietcong controlled much of the
southern countryside.After a decade of these tactics the communistsplanned a devastating blow. The Tet offensive,
launched in January 1968 by the Vietcong andVietminh against the towns of South Vietnam,was designed as an all-out effort to impress on the
Americans that the Vietcong were far stronger
than they had supposed. It caught the Americans
and the South Vietnamese completely by surprise,because Tet was the national New Year holidayperiod, during which a truce had always been
observed, and because the towns of South
Vietnam had hitherto been thought secure
against the largely rural Vietcong. In preparationfor Tet, the North Vietnamese had endeavouredto draw US troops from the towns by a diver-
sionary attack on a northern US base at Khesan.
Then, on 31 January, scores of Vietnamese towns
were assaulted by some 70,000 Vietcong and
Vietminh, who created widespread destructionand even penetrated the heavily fortified USEmbassy compound in Saigon. The carnage was
worst in the ancient city of Hue in central
Vietnam: there the Vietcong overwhelmed the
South Vietnamese garrison and during theirthree-week occupation massacred 3,000 peopleand buried them in hastily dug mass graves.Before American and South Vietnamese troopsregained control, the Tet offensive had caused
them 6,000 combat deaths. Thousands more
Vietnamese civilians died, caught up in the ﬁght-ing. For the Vietcong, the casualties amounted toa devastating 50,000. As a ﬁghting force they
never recovered. The weakening of the Vietcong
was not unwelcome in Hanoi. Indeed, in a sense
Tet was a double victory for the North Viet-namese: it undermined American confidence that the war would ever be won and it prevented
the independent communists in the South from
being able to challenge the northern communist604TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
regime. The Vietminh henceforth played themajor military role and so gained the upper handin determining the future of Vietnam.The North Vietnamese were certainly encour-aged by the growing protest movement against
the war in the US and by their success in under-mining the authority of the South Vietnameseregime. They calculated that an American with-
drawal would be hastened if they showed a 
readiness to talk peace while continuing to inﬂict
heavy casualties on Americans in Vietnam: a point
would be reached when American public opinionwould force the administration to accept the com-munist peace terms in all essentials. Nixon’s policy
of Vietnamisation played into their hands as they
negotiated interminably in Paris. Their prime aim
was to reach an agreement that would get the USout but would leave them able to continue thewar within the country until ﬁnal victory. So they
resolutely rejected any proposal put forward by
Henry Kissinger, America’s chief negotiator in
Paris, which required both North Vietnameseforces and the Americans to withdraw from theSouth. American bombing caused grievous losses
but, making use of widely dispersed factories and
with supplies of arms from China and Russia, thecommunist leadership in Hanoi was prepared tocontinue waging war for years to come.In January 1973 a ceaseﬁre was ﬁnally agreed.The Americans would withdraw from Vietnam
within sixty days and the settlement would be left
to the Vietnamese. But the ceaseﬁre was not a pre-lude to peace. The North Vietnamese soonresumed the conﬂict and, despite massive supplies
of American arms, the badly led South Vietnamese
army crumbled completely. The Watergate scan-
dal had removed Nixon in August 1974, and 
his successor President Ford knew only too wellthat the American people would not sanction a renewed US involvement in the war. As the
North Vietnamese army thrust south, millions of
refugees ﬂed in terror towards Saigon, but the
capital itself fell on 30 April 1957 as the lastAmericans and accompanying Vietnamese werelifted from an American safe house in a frenzied
evacuation, seventy helicopters carrying 1,000
people to safety on the US warships lying offshore.
But hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese ofﬁcersand civil servants who had been loyal to theAmerican-backed South Vietnamese regime were
left behind to face the rigours of ‘re-education’ by
their new masters. They were taken to camps,1THE VIETNAM WAR AND AFTER605

imposed a one-party state. They set out to abolishcapitalism and collectivise land, with disastrousresults. The people suffered once again from the
corruption of ofﬁcials and the incompetence of
the administration. During the 1980s more
market-oriented economic policies were intro-

duced, permitting entrepreneurs, especially in thesouth, to run small factories and services forproﬁt. Within the top echelon of the party there
was a constant struggle between the reformers,
the pragmatists who wanted to follow China’s
example, and the party ideologues, who believedthat these experiments weakened Marxism–Leninism. The conﬂict was principally about the
correct economic policies in order to raise
Vietnam’s low standards of living, which in bad
years led to widespread malnutrition. But therewas no thought of turning the one-party stateinto a multi-party democracy. Economic liberali-
sation won the upper hand in the second half of
the 1980s, but bad state management of the
economy led to hyperinﬂation checked periodi-
cally by austerity measures. Attempts to attractforeign investment had little success. With theoutbreak of revolution in Eastern Europe and
Soviet perestroika, Vietnam’s political controltightened once more in 1989 and 1990. Vietnam
remains one of the poorest countries in the world,barely able to feed its rapidly expanding popula-tion, which reached 66 million in 1989.One major reason for Vietnam’s povertybesides communist mismanagement is the great
amount still spent on defence: its army is over 1
million strong. Since 1975, Vietnam has lived inregional isolation. Only the Soviet Union pro-vided aid, which rapidly decreased after 1985
(Russia gave no aid in the early 1990s). The US
maintained a trade embargo. The failure to
account for US servicemen missing during thewar is one stumbling-block to improved relationswith the US, though some American aid has been
given. Relations with its northern neighbour
reached their nadir when Vietnam invaded andoccupied most of Kampuchea in December 1978and expelled the Chinese-backed Pol Pot regime.The Vietnamese-installed government was os-
tracised by the international community and
Vietnam was condemned. The Chinese mounted
an armed attack across the Vietnamese border inFebruary 1979, but withdrew three weeks laterin March having, as Beijing put it, ‘taught’ the
Vietnamese a ‘lesson’. Thereafter in the 1980s the
Chinese maintained a threatening posture on
Vietnam’s northern border with occasional armed
clashes, but relations have become much less tensesince Vietnam withdrew from Kampuchea in1989. The constant stream of refugees from south
Vietnam by sea (the ‘boat people’) and overland
to Thailand, Malaya and Hong Kong also aggra-
vated Vietnam’s neighbours. The US acceptedhundreds of thousands of Vietnamese and, morerecently, numbers of ‘Amerasians’, the mixed chil-
dren of US servicemen and Vietnamese.Vietnam remained isolated until the early1990s, and no large-scale international aid orcapital investment had reached it. A people whohad suffered so much deserved a better fate, and
there were increasing signs that the US felt it had
a moral responsibility to help. By the mid-1990s
Vietnam’s isolation from the West was ended: in
1994 the US lifted its trade embargo and a yearlater normalised relations. Vietnam continued tobe ruled by an elderly Marxist Politburo, veterans
of the war, like the party general secretary Do
Muoi, aged eighty in 1996. The door was never-
theless opened slightly to Western ‘capitalist’investment. With 80 per cent of the people livingin the countryside, the limited impact made itself
felt principally in the cities. The cultural attrac-
tion of the West, however, proved strong for the
younger generation born since the war. Tension
is inevitable. Given the regulation and bureau-cracy of the regime and their opposition to theimports of Western culture, the new millennium
was reached before Vietnam had the opportunity
to emerge from its backward economic state.
Western inﬂuence could not be kept out. Vietnambecame a popular tourist destination early in thetwenty-ﬁrst century. What is extraordinary is the
friendliness the Western visitors now encounter.
The absence of hatred bodes better for the future.606TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
There was one aspect of Chinese life that did notchange after the communist victory in 1949:
China continued to be ruled autocratically by a
powerful leader who used the threat of punish-ment to keep the people under control. MaoZedong manipulated a tight group of supporters
in the central party apparatus, ridding himself of
‘enemies’. During the twenty-seven years from
1949 to his death in 1976, his was the guiding
spirit. He made clever use of the Politburomembers to represent a variety of policies, fromthe radical and revolutionary socialist to the more
pragmatic reformist. Mao would back one group
against another according to what suited his
immediate purpose; he felt no personal loyalties.This way of operating allowed him every option,and a change of policy would discredit yesterday’s
men rather than the chairman. Mao believed in
driving the revolution forward by appeals to the
masses, but just as important was the exercise of
control through coercion. The great surges ofrevolutionary fervour were masterminded by Maohimself, though at crisis-points he expediently
accepted pauses, even temporary reversals. Thus
the revolutionary drives were interspersed with
periods of retrenchment during which economicrecovery was permitted to take precedence overrevolution. But Mao feared that too long a 
soft period would weaken mass revolutionary
ardour and lead China back onto the capitalist
road to ‘bourgeois values’, instead of advancingit towards a communist utopia.Continuous revolution, faith in the power ofthe masses and in his ability to compel them to 
follow his lead, self-help if foreign aid was not
available without unacceptable strings, the need to propel China irrevocably towards its commu-nist goal – these remained Mao’s consistent guide-
lines even when abrupt changes of direction
bewildered the outside world. Those who oppos-
ed him were ruthlessly eliminated. The picture of
the benign, fatherly Mao was as much a product of propaganda as that of ‘Uncle Joe’.Soon after Mao’s death in 1976, the conceptsof ‘revolution’ and ‘socialism’ were replaced by
new ideas about modernisation; class conﬂict was
dropped from the ofﬁcial vocabulary; capitalist
experiments were encouraged. Much of Mao’srevolutionary Marxism was now condemned. Yet
in one crucial respect there was no change. The
all-powerful inner group of party leaders could
alone decide on the proper course China should
follow. As none of Mao’s successors could hopeto achieve his prestige, the struggles within theparty leadership assumed a new signiﬁcance.Mobilising the masses involved the use of ter-ror against those designated as the enemy. Whole
families were made to suffer for the alleged delin-quency or opposition of any one of its members.Revolutions require enemies and after 1949 these
enemies were ‘uncovered’ not only outside the
continental conﬁnes of China but also within. The
ﬁrst target was the hated landlord class, who weredelivered up to peasant vengeance. During the1Chapter 56CONTINUOUS REVOLUTIONMAO’S CHINAﬁrst four years of communist rule some three-quarters of a million enemies, principally landown-ers, were summarily executed. Four-fifths of
China’s population lived in the countryside, so
Mao was making sure that they would view the
revolution favourably: this was the first steptowards their mass indoctrination. To this endMao allowed the landlords’ holdings to be divided
up among the peasants – a step backwards from
his ideal of a socialised peasantry.The redistribution of land after 1950 gave thepeasants what they most hungered after. Theirtiny holdings, although still meagre, were onaverage doubled or trebled in size. The richer
peasants, the so-called ‘middle peasants’, bene-
ﬁted the most. The extortion of taxes was abol-
ished and a more just system introduced. Beforethe road to communism could be taken, China’sindustrial strength had to be built up and greater
yields obtained from the land. The Chinese head
of state, Liu Shaoqui, declared these to be the
country’s basic policy aims; Mao, chairman of theparty and the undisputed overall leader of China,was prepared until the mid-1950s to bide his time
before driving the revolution on. From 1949 to
1955 the party preached harmony (except for its
hostility towards feudal landlords and agents of
Chiang Kai-shek). In the cities private enterpriseand ownership were allowed to persist in a mixedeconomy, while in the vast rural areas socialist
schemes were brought in gradually and were
always voluntary. The peasant owned his land, but
‘mutual aid teams’ introduced shared labour andshared use of animals and equipment, and anumber of cooperatives were formed. The most
urgent task in 1949 was reconstruction. For this
the professionals, the engineers, the businessmen
and the owners of factories in the newly liberated
areas were for the time being indispensable, andthey were provided with the class label of‘national bourgeoisie’.Mao’s China in 1949 proclaimed not a com-munist republic but the People’s Democratic
Dictatorship. Democratic did not mean that theproletariat would be supreme in the state; rather,it meant that the four classes of peasants, workers,
petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie
would work together under the leadership of theparty to bring about China’s recovery. How longthis apparent harmony would be allowed to con-tinue only Mao knew. While he presided over an
apparently cohesive central party committee,
allowing his principal lieutenants wide-ranging
debate over different policy options and acting aschairman, receiving advice from different quar-ters, his deeper purpose was revealed by his inces-
sant discovery of new contradictions, his stirring
up of new conﬂicts. In 1951 he launched a cam-
paign against the ‘three evils’ of corruption, waste
and bureaucracy among the local communistcadres, its purpose being to increase centralcontrol and keep local party ofﬁcials on their toes.
The following year was added a campaign against
the ‘ﬁve evils’; this time the masses were aroused
against the ‘bourgeoisie’ in a struggle to eradicatebribery of government ofﬁcials, tax evasion, theftof state property, cheating on government con-
tracts and speculation. In this way private indus-
trial and commercial enterprises were constantly
threatened. Mao’s revolution fed on fear, intimi-dation and denunciation – three genuine evils ofthe system.Nevertheless, the ﬁrst years of communist rulealso brought about genuine improvements for
most of the Chinese people. The cessation of
ﬁghting and destruction was the greatest and mostimmediate. There was also a measure of mass ide-alism, as the people acted together to improve
conditions. This was most noticeable in the cities,
where neighbourhood groups organised by party
ofﬁcials tackled the sanitation systems and spreadpoison to get rid of the rats, carriers of disease.Life on the land and in the factories was made
more congenial. One measure of success was a
dramatic fall in the mortality rate. After the
ruinous inﬂation of the Kuomintang years, prices
had become stable. Living standards, especially ofthe poorest peasants, had risen. In the citiesunemployment was halved, attendance at school
and college nearly doubled; cholera and plagues
had been brought under control. The gross
output of industry was one and a half times greaterin 1952 than it had been in 1949; agriculturaloutput, on which the country depended, was up
by half. Roads and railway lines were constructed.
These were the considerable accomplishments.608TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
In 1952 Mao set out the general line of policyto be followed. China was in a period of transi-tion, from the foundation of what was now 
called the People’s Republic to the socialist trans-
formation of agriculture, industry and handi-
crafts, to be accomplished ‘step by step over afairly long period of time’. The priorities were toincrease production, to raise standards of living,
and to strengthen China’s defences. Liu Shaoqui
announced at the Eighth Party Congress in 1956
that the transition to socialism had been largely
accomplished and would be completed over thenext decade.During the early years of Mao’s rule Chinaconducted itself aggressively on the international
stage. In 1950–1, it claimed sovereignty over
Tibet, overcoming local resistance with great bru-tality. The US developed an implacable hostility toChina and maintained its support for Chiang Kai-
shek in Taiwan. The outbreak of the Korean War
opened another front, when Mao, overriding his
more cautious advisers, decided on China’s inter-vention in November 1950. Isolated from theWest, China had no alternative but to align itself
with the Soviet Union. The Korean War imposed
huge strains and sacriﬁces on China, and until the
armistice was signed at Panmunjon in July 1953,
Mao had to restrain his revolutionary drive.When planning began in 1953 to increaseChina’s industrial base, the Soviet model was
adopted. The Russians provided assistance and
sent 10,000 engineers to work with the Chinese
while three times that number of Chinese wereaccepted for training in the Soviet Union. Plants,machinery and technical designs all came from
Russia. The emphasis was on the expansion of
energy supplies and heavy industry – iron and
steel mills, electricity power stations, machine-
tool factories. In all, 156 projects were sponsoredby the Soviet Union. Without this help China’smodernisation of industry would have been far
slower. America’s Marshall Aid to Europe likewise
accelerated the recovery and prosperity of
Western Europe, but it came in the form of loansand grants that enabled the Europeans to importfrom the US what they needed. Soviet aid came
in the form of people, training and technology,
but the Chinese had to pay for them. The SovietUnion needed capital for its own reconstructionand its loans to China were small. But the jointSoviet–Chinese companies that had been estab-
lished were not a success. Mao insisted on com-
plete Chinese sovereignty and they were dissolved
in 1954 after Stalin’s death.Just as the First Five-Year Plan was gettingunder way, Mao bypassed the central party lead-
ership and in 1955 began his long campaign to
transform China’s independent landowning peas-
antry into collectivised socialist workers on the
land. Despite vicissitudes, Mao never abandonedthat aim and had substantially achieved it by thetime of his death. But the cost to China was huge.
The famines that followed alone caused some 20
million deaths.Mao’s plans for collectivisation illustrate hisdetermination to build socialism with Chinesecharacteristics. The peasant continued to own his
home and, in less radical phases, small plots – but
the rest of the land and all the labour were col-
lectivised in three tiers. The bottom tier wascalled the production team, perhaps a village ofthirty or forty families. Everything was pooled and
the earnings of the team shared out between
them. A larger collectivised unit was the produc-
tion brigade, made up of several production
teams. Production brigades together formed thecollectives. Whether earnings would be accountedfor and distributed at the production team,
brigade or collective level depended on Mao’s
decree and varied with different phases of more
or less radical policies.The better-off ‘middle peasants’ were reluctantto cooperate with the poorer, and the production
of rice and soya beans, staple Chinese foods,
scarcely kept pace with the country’s growing
population. For a short period the party blamed
the poor results not on Mao but on the over-hastysetting up of the large cooperatives. Following theSoviet model, the party leaders concluded, had led
to a lopsided development of heavy industry at the
expense of light industry and agriculture. From
1956 until early 1957 was a period of relaxationand consolidation. The emphasis at the EighthCongress of the Communist Party in September
1956 was shifted from building socialism, which it
was claimed had been more or less accomplished,1CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION609
to increasing productivity and correcting the agri-cultural backwardness. This new line, which wasintended to help China catch up with the West,
required more individual enterprise, encouraged
in part by the provision of incentives. Students and
intellectuals, cowed by previous campaigns againstthem, were now wooed. Deng Xiaoping, one ofMao’s rising lieutenants, advocated more worker
participation in management as one way of
increasing productivity. This, in the Chinese deﬁ-
nition, was greater participation – always subject,
though, to the leadership of the party.In February 1957 Mao delivered a speech ‘Onthe Correct Handling of Contradictions among
People’. One passage in particular received wide-
spread publicity for its apparent espousal of
freedom of ideas among the scientiﬁc and intel-lectual community – ‘letting a hundred ﬂowersblossom and a hundred schools of thought
contend’. But what seemed to the West to be a
move towards tolerance and plurality was no more
than a tactical device, a means to an end, the per-ceived precondition for what became known asthe Great Leap Forward. It encouraged China’s
intellectuals and was meant to act as a restraint
on party bureaucracy at the local level. Freedom
of thought would not, however, be allowed to
challenge central control and leadership.During the winter of 1957 and into the springof 1958, 60 million peasants were put to work on
water-conservancy constructions to aid agricul-

ture. Mass human power was to be used in place
of more advanced technology to achieve quickresults. At the same time as plans for the GreatLeap Forward were implemented, a purge of
intellectuals was begun in a bewildering reversal
of the previous year. The pendulum had thus
swung once more. Mao intervened to pronounce
a new line after watching the turmoil of destalin-isation in Poland and Hungary in 1956; this wascalled the Anti-Rightist campaign. The ‘hundred
ﬂowers’ had blossomed for little more than one
season. In every factory 5 per cent of the workers
had to be denounced as ‘rightists’ and subjectedto a witch-hunt. Up to 700,000 ‘intellectuals’, oreducated Chinese, were thrown out of their posi-
tions and professions and sent to the countryside
for so-called labour reform. The contempt for theintellectuals, the need to control and subjugatethem, now took precedence over China’s desper-ate need for their skills. It was easy to treat them
harshly as they were isolated from China’s masses
of peasants and workers. Denunciation by family,
friends, colleagues and fellow workers, whichinevitably sowed distrust, was one of the party’smost effective means of control. Abroad, China’s
softer line cooperating with a neutral Third
World, exempliﬁed by the Bandung Conference
in 1955 and the stance of ‘peaceful coexistence’,
was followed by increased militancy and self-assertion. In 1958 China’s relations with Taiwanreached a new crisis-point, and on India’s border
in 1959 there were armed clashes.Mao’s faith that the ideologically motivated peas-ants and workers could overcome all obstacles,that the grassroot masses were what mattered, not
the professionals and intellectuals, found practical
expression in what party propaganda described as
the Great Leap Forward – actually two leaps, in1958 and 1959–60. They proved an unmitigateddisaster for the Chinese economy and people.In the countryside the people’s cooperativeswere merged into huge communes under ideo-
logical local party leadership. They now com-
prised not only agriculture but also grass-rootsindustrial units. Unrealistic production targetswere set. Now not only would steel be smelted in
the new modern mills, but iron would be pro-
duced in small peasant furnaces. Chaos ensued:
industrial production declined and agriculturaloutput dropped by a quarter. A renewed ‘leap’ in1959 and 1960 resulted in further disastrous agri-
cultural and industrial losses. In the ﬁrst quarter
of 1961 alone output of twenty-ﬁve key industrial
products dropped by between 30 and 40 per cent.
There was a chronic grain shortage as China’spopulation increased, and famine became wide-spread. More than 20 million people died.After the failure of the Great Leap Forward,Mao permitted a reformist party leadership to
follow policies at variance with his longer-termobjectives, because priority had to be given toincrease food supplies and resume industrial
growth – in other words, to repair the ravages of
the Great Leap Forward. Thus from 1960 to610TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
1963 the party returned to more rational plan-ning. China’s professionals were appeased andtold that they were part of the working people.
Private plots and handicraft enterprise were again
permitted. The peasantry were allowed to sell
their produce in a free market provided they ful-ﬁlled their state quotas. To feed China’s growingpopulation – it increased by 80 million between
1957 and 1965 – incentives were necessary to
raise production. Even so, agriculture barely
recovered to its 1957 level and the shortfall had
to be made good by grain imports.All these policies of the so-called reformistswere opposed by an ultra-left group that placed
the revolutionary class struggle ﬁrst. The reform-
ers were led by the nominal head of state, 
Liu Shaoqui, and Deng Xiaoping; the defence minister Lin Biao, who in 1959 had replacedPeng Dehuai, dismissed for openly criticising
Mao’s Great Leap Forward, was a sycophantic
supporter of Mao’s most extreme policies; Mao’s
wife, the former actress Jiang Quing, was anotheruncompromising extremist. Then there werevarious groupings between the two; Premier
Zhou Enlai was the most enduring and able,
manoeuvring cleverly so that he never lost Mao’s
approval. Mao waited until he judged the time
right before resuming the revolutionary lead.Unquestionably there was serious inner-partystrife at the top level of the Politburo from 1958
to 1966. Mao permitted the different groupings
to coexist, acting only if there were any outright
criticisms of the chairman himself, such as thosevoiced by the disgraced Peng. The inner work-ings of Chinese party politics permit more than
one interpretation. It is possible that Mao gen-
uinely had to struggle against opponents in the
party to reassert his authority. Much more likely,
Mao deliberately chose to withdraw from time totime to study and reﬂect, and to dissociate himselffrom ‘rectiﬁcation’ policies that he would later
attack and condemn.This explains certain simultaneous but contra-dictory currents in Chinese politics. In theautumn of 1962 Mao indicated a return to a moreradical course with a campaign against writers and
the resurfacing of bourgeois and capitalist ten-
dencies. He turned to a new generation: ‘youthmust be educated so that our nation will remainrevolutionary and incorruptible for generationsand forever’. In the spring of 1963 he claimed
that landlords and rich peasants were regaining
their influence, corrupting and manipulating 
local party officials, and ‘developing counter-revolutionary organisations’. Meanwhile, DengXiaoping, now the party’s general secretary, was
giving priority to economic recovery, above all to
repair the ravages in agriculture. Deng had
expressed this view uncompromisingly: ‘As long
as we increase production, we can revert to indi-vidual enterprise; it hardly matters whether agood cat is black or white – as long as it catches
mice.’ This did not mean that Deng was a liberal
in the Western sense, that he envisaged aban-
doning communism or authoritarian control from the centre. He was adopting a pragmaticapproach to China’s immediate economic prob-
lems – any incentives offered to private enterprise
would be determined by the party. The party
would continue to control China.By 1963, Mao was preparing to move againstDeng and the policies he advocated, but ‘self-
criticism’ saved him in 1966. Liu Shaoqui was not
so fortunate; dismissed from all his posts in 1968,
he died in prison a year later. With the help of
Lin Biao, Mao embarked on an intensive cam-paign to radicalise the young army recruits with‘the thoughts of Chairman Mao’.The famous Little Red Book was written toindoctrinate them. ‘Study Chairman Mao’s writ-
ings, follow his teachings and act according to hisinstructions’, ordered Lin Biao. Mao’s quotationscan be cited in justiﬁcation of all the changes of
policy resorted to and cover every possible con-
dition. They are taken from his writings and
speeches from the 1920s to the 1950s. By group-
ing them in thirty-three thematic chapters underheadings such as ‘Self-Reliance and ArduousStruggle’, ‘Serving the People’ and so on, but
then jumbling up any chronological sequence
within each section, they can be used to support
many different arguments by selective citation.They thus convey a sense of infallibility despitetheir contradictions. The Little Red Book became
the holy writ of the student youth revolt of 1966
– that is, of the Red Guards.1CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION611
China’s difﬁculties were compounded by its inter-national isolation. Khrushchev’s destalinisation inthe Soviet Union led to a breach with Mao, who
accused him of revisionism and of leading the
Soviet Union back on to the capitalist road. He
condemned him for betraying the revolutionwhile exhibiting great-power chauvinism by sup-pressing nationalism in Eastern Europe. Mao
vehemently rejected the Soviet leader’s attempts
to use the assistance given to China to control its
policies. In 1959 Khrushchev first withdrew
Soviet help from the programme to build China’sown atomic weapons. Faced with America’snuclear threat, China would have to construct
nuclear weapons by itself, and it succeeded in
doing so. In 1960 Khrushchev dealt a heavy blow
to the Chinese economy, stopping all aid andrecalling some 30,000 Soviet engineers and tech-nicians from China. Mao discerned ominous signs
of Soviet–American collusion after the Soviet
failure in Cuba, and the Test Ban Treaty in 1963
was a clear indication to him that the US and theSoviet Union were joining one great-power camp.Mao placed China in opposition to this sup-posed collusion, calling on the Third World coun-
tries in Asia, Africa and Latin America not to be
afraid but to struggle for their independence:
‘People of the world, unite and defeat US aggres-sors and their running dogs ... Monsters of all
kinds shall be destroyed.’ Nuclear weapons need
not strike fear in the hearts of peoples struggling
against imperialism, Mao declared, using a
colourful metaphor, for the nuclear powers werejust ‘paper tigers’. But when in 1962 he con-ceived the fear that America would back a Chiang
Kai-shek invasion, he allowed himself to be reas-
sured by a hastily arranged contact between the
Chinese and American embassies in Warsaw.Mao took care not to involve China againdirectly in any ﬁghting against a stronger enemy.His diatribes against the Soviet Union and the US
remained rhetorical. He was opposed to any mili-
tary confrontation with the US, even when he was
urged to intervene in Vietnam, where theAmericans were stepping up their support for theanti-communist southern republic. The case of
India was different. Earlier good relations with
Nehru deteriorated when the Indians expressedtheir sympathy for the subjugated Tibetans andwelcomed the Dalai Lama and Tibetan refugeesafter the revolt of 1959. When the Indians occu-
pied some Chinese border posts on the ill-deﬁned
Sino-Indian frontier, Mao reacted forcefully.
Launching a major military offensive in October1962, he routed the inferior Indian forces. But,having taught India a painful lesson, he declared a
unilateral ceaseﬁre in November and withdrew to
a rectiﬁed frontier line which India later accepted.
Thus, the early 1960s were years of danger and
crisis as perceived by Mao; his response to the US, the Soviet Union and Taiwan was notappeasement but independence, a determination
to defend China. But he was also cautious, avoid-
ing direct military engagement except on the
Indian frontier, where it was strictly limited.As Mao contemplated Khrushchev’s errors in the1960s, he feared that leading party members in
China might well be tempted to emulate him and
take the capitalist road. So his condemnation ofKhrushchev was intended also to serve as a warn-ing at home to the party. One of the roots of the
Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was cer-
tainly Mao’s concern that the revolution was
being betrayed by the ‘bourgeois’ ideas of Deng
and Liu.Mao sought to revive the revolutionary spiritby unleashing a conﬂict between the masses on
the one hand, and the party functionaries, the
bureaucracy and all those who had a stake in pre-
serving the status quo in China, on the other. ToWesterners one of the most curious features ofChinese politics is the oblique way a new policy
is signalled by a development that might seem
quite trivial. Mao preferred this approach. He
began his assault in 1965 by criticising the writer
Wu Han, one of whose plays some years earlierhe had interpreted as an attack on himself. Thisseemed innocuous. But Wu was the protégé of
Deng Xiaoping, the party general secretary. Mao
then left the capital and manoeuvred to gain
support among the various factions within thewidespread Chinese power structure. In February1966, with his wife Jiang Quing now playing a
prominent role, he declared his intention to
launch the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.612TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
A distinguished Chinese economic historian,Xue Mugiao, director of China’s EconomicResearch Centre, in the 1980s condemned the
Cultural Revolution as initiated by a leader
labouring under a misapprehension and capi-

talised on by counter-revolutionary cliques; it ledto domestic turmoil and brought catastrophe tothe party, the state and the whole people. Such
criticism of Mao became possible only in the
reformist 1980s. At the time party members
attempted to defend themselves while sycophan-
tically declaring their loyalty and obedience to thechairman. Liu was not so lucky.The convulsion of the Cultural Revolutionwrecked millions of lives. From 1966 to 1968 the
struggles assumed the proportions of a civil war,
with ﬁerce ﬁghting and brigandage in many partsof the country. Mao had aroused the people todenounce each other. In the process he raised 
his teaching to an unprecedented personality cult.
The revolution began with the dissident students
and disgruntled teachers, who organised them-selves spontaneously into ‘Red Guards’ to carryout Mao’s will. The Cultural Revolution was
unique among student revolts of the late 1960s
in that it was encouraged from the very top
against the more privileged elders. The students
proceeded physically to assault the ‘monsters anddemons and all counter-revolutionary revisionistsof the Khrushchev type’ and to ransack their
homes; they vowed that they would carry Mao’s
socialist revolution through to its end. Their
instruments were terror and humiliation. On 18 August 1966, Mao appeared on the gallery ofthe Tiananmen Gate of Heavenly Peace, to be
adulated by huge crowds of Red Guards, who
packed the square before him all day. Eventually
he descended into the square itself to be among
them; more than a million Red Guards had comefrom outside Beijing to join those in the capitalalready. They were ordered to ‘spread disorder’,
to attack the party bureaucrats, to root out
Chinese tradition and bourgeois revisionism –
indeed to eliminate all the elements that had infiltrated the party and were taking the false capitalist road.The student Red Guards fanned out through-out the country to radicalise the masses in thecities; the vast countryside of China remained lessaffected. In factories they enlisted workers. It wasa movement that became anarchic and violent;
teachers, professionals, anyone in authority could
become the target of their attacks, sons and
daughters denounced parents or failed to protectthem. The Red Guards were rendering China’surban centres virtually ungovernable, as local
party structures were paralysed by their onslaught.
Much destruction was inﬂicted on Mao’s orders,
but the Red Guards were incapable of putting a
new orderly structure in place of those that hadceased to function.After a few months Mao had to call a tempor-ary halt. The People’s Liberation Army was the
one force able to restrain Red Guard rampages,
and had already intervened in places. But it wasnot a proper instrument for furthering revolution;it was more suitable for repressing disorder of
whatever ideological nuance. By the spring of
1967 the army had become a dominant force in
the country and was gradually restoring order,ﬁghting the radicals, replacing the party, movinginto factories and controlling the extremists. It
was not the outcome of the revolution Mao had
planned. Cities were destroyed, and hundreds of
thousands of lives were lost.Mao now unleashed the second phase of therevolution, attempting to curb the army. RedGuards went back on the rampage. Throughout
China different factions were locked in con-

frontation. Mao could inﬂuence events but even
he could not control their outcome. Among the most strident voices encouraging the RedGuards to persevere was that of Mao’s wife, Jiang
Quing. Violence reached new heights in August
1967. The revolutionary committees, which had
replaced the local party machines, now battled
against more extremist youths. Trains carryingweapons destined for Vietnam were looted.Peasants in rival factions, army units, Red Guard
groups all fought each other. In Wuhan military
groups refused to obey directives from Beijing.
The army itself became divided. In Beijing, LiuShaoqui, nominal head of state, still remained asa symbol of party opposition to Mao, although
he had been made to ‘confess his crimes’. But the
control Mao and his supporters could exercise1CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION613
over the central apparatus could do nothing torestore China to order and sanity.By September 1967 Mao was ready to acceptthat the most important task now was to stop
China from disintegrating further. Only the pro-fessional army could restore order; blame forexcesses could now be shifted on to Mao’s
advisers and the Red Guards, who had exceeded
their functions. The betrayal of his most ferventsupporters meant nothing to Mao. The myth ofhis detached infallibility of judgement had to 
be preserved, although he was the author of
China’s woes. His wife indirectly admitted to mis-takes and now sided with the army against theRed Guards, who were exhorted to practise self-
criticism. Mao had to admit that they had proved
incapable of providing leadership and impetus torevolutionary China. Only strife and chaos hadfollowed in their path. Behind the scenes Prime
Minister Zhou Enlai and Lin Piao, the defenceminister, were taking charge. The distinctionbetween a Red Guard and a criminal became
blurred. Many were executed. The restoration of
order was an enormous task, only graduallyachieved, and social ferment and the killings byradical factions continued sporadically even as lateas 1968. The army was now praised for imposingrevolutionary discipline and for defending the‘dictatorship of the proletariat’. The Red Guards,
yesterday in the vanguard of socialist progress,
had become ‘leftist opportunists’, ‘anarchists’ and‘class enemies’. Mao’s army ‘Thought Teams’were sent in to take charge of universities and 
colleges.Mao now initiated a new movement that wonthe approval of both the army and the Beijing
moderates. The cities and universities were
cleared of students and intellectuals and rowdyyouths; they were overpopulated anyway. Some20 million Chinese were forced into the country-
side in 1968 and 1969 to learn to labour as
peasants. The ‘young intellectuals’ were under-going re-education. In October Liu Shaoqui’sdisgrace was complete. Only Mao emerged intact.
Lin Piao at the Ninth National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party in April 1969 absolvedMao of all blame and buried the CulturalRevolution, describing its demise as a ‘great
victory’. The cost, in lives and in blighted careers,
was enormous and was to set China back by adecade even after the immediate losses of pro-duction in 1967 and 1968 had been made good.614TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949

symbolise for China the communist victory and
China’s emergence as a world power. And herein
lies the ﬁnal contradiction: Mao’s benign reputa-tion was not deserved; terror and violence werethe result of the ideological utopias he had pur-
sued. He had ruined millions of lives in the Great
Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution and the
wholesale forced migrations. Mao had attempted
to ensure that as his life drew to a close the revo-lutionary ﬁre would not be extinguished with him.The excesses of the Cultural Revolution, however,
taught some of the Chinese leadership a bitter les-
son in the dangers of Mao’s line of thought and
action. By the time he died in September 1976, inthe context of economic planning there wouldonly be a revolutionary ﬂicker of his radical ideas
left. But the heritage of a repressive political one-
party state remained very much intact.The Chinese revolution had created its ownGulag, a network of forced job placement andlabour camps. Millions of prisoners were con-
demned to forced labour, sometimes for decades,
without trial. During the frequent famines, such
as that after Mao’s disastrous experiment in 1958,life was reduced to searching for scraps of food.We know from surviving witnesses that in such
camps the obsession with food replaced all feel-
ings and other desires. Those suspected of ‘wrong
thinking’, the ‘rightists’ and other dissidents fared
the worst and had to submit to sessions of re-edu-cation to crush their independent spirit. Howmany hundreds of thousands did not survive can
only be estimated. There were variations between
conditions in different camps depending on the
camp commanders, the work to be performed andthe prevailing political mood. One truth emergesfrom all this horror: the resilience and courage of
the survivors show that the human spirit knows
no boundaries of nationality or race.1CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION615
In the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square killingsin 1989, the Chinese communist leaders acted
like a caste of high priests. They alone could
delineate the right path to be followed by a billionof their fellow Chinese. Yet since 1949 Chinesehistory had been marked by abrupt changes. The
correct line at any one moment was determined
by the ascendant group among the elite. After
Mao’s death in 1976, no one carried enough
prestige to assume his mantle, though DengXiaoping managed for a decade to exert overrid-ing inﬂuence. When there was a change of policy,
the leader turned on his erstwhile supporters, who
were now revealed as deviationists, enemies or
counter-revolutionaries – exposed by the vigilanceof the victorious faction. The rest of China, fromthe regional cadres to the humble peasant, was
coerced into following the new line. The impris-
onment of opponents was commonplace, as was
the execution of criminals.This structure, however, in no way inhibitedpower struggles among China’s leadership, whichoccurred right through to the 1990s. But the ten-
sions and conﬂicts within the Politburo could

only be guessed at until the victory of one group
and leader brought them out into the open. Theparty could ‘reform’ only from the top down.Reform from below or outside the party – that 
is, democracy – would undermine this self-
perpetuating system. So any radical change in the
way China was ruled had to be effected by theleadership itself. For any Chinese leader, controlof the army was thus as vital as control of thePolitburo. The chairmanship of the Military
Affairs Commission was a key position of great
power; its occupant ensured that posts held underhim, such as the deputy director, the chief of staffand the director of the Political Department, were
ﬁlled by his supporters. Yet the decades following
Mao’s death witnessed a transformation. One-
party control remained. Might not otherwise
China have succumbed again to regional disinte-gration and chaos during the years of greatchange. Yet year by year the people did gain more
freedoms, with one proviso; they could not fun-
damentally challenge party rule without risking
incarceration. Party leaders in big cities down tosmall rural communities enjoy unchallengedpower. Corruption was rife despite constant cam-
paigns to check its spread and the threats of dra-
conian punishment. At ﬁrst there were few signs
of a new dawn.Until his death in 1976, Mao continued todominate China whenever he chose to set the line
of policy to be followed. The violent changes from
1949 to 1976 reflected his perversion of the
Confucian doctrine of the Golden Mean – aradical move would be followed by consolidationand relaxation only to be succeeded by the next
step forward. The demise of the Red Guards in
1968, however, was succeeded not so much by
consolidation and relaxation as by a change in thedirection of the revolution. The student RedChapter 57THE LAST YEARS OF MAO AND HIS HEIRSTHE REVOLUTION CHANGES COURSEGuards had experienced real and heady power; inthe name of Mao they had taken the law into theirown hands, believing that they should lead
Chinese society through revolution to communist
utopia. They had ventured forth with Mao’s bless-

ing, causing mayhem and attacking not only thelocal ofﬁcials, as Mao had instructed in his BigCharacter Poster of August 1966, ‘Bombard the
Headquarters’, but also anyone belonging to the
traditional establishment. Their bitterness and 
disillusionment when Mao and the party leader-

ship suppressed them and forced them to labourin the countryside were ﬁerce indeed. Paradoxi-
cally the Cultural Revolution also gave rise to the
Democracy Movement, whose ideals of individual
rights and liberties were the exact opposite of the
Red Guards’ cry of submission to Mao’s doctrinesand vision.During the last years of his life Mao actedmore and more autocratically. He found it useful
to maintain in power a Politburo in which the
extreme left group (Gang of Four), whichincluded Jiang Quing, his actress wife since 1938,was balanced by the reformists, led by Deng
Xiaoping, who returned to the central stage in
1973 as one of the vice-premiers. Premier Zhou
Enlai, who had weathered all the turns of policy,
moving just sufﬁciently in whatever direction thewind blew, was a moderating influence. Hisunqualiﬁed loyalty to Mao and his ﬂexibility help
to explain how he alone among China’s political
elite had remained at the centre. The attempts by
the Gang of Four to undermine his position onlyearned them Mao’s reproof, but they too retainedconsiderable influence until the chairman’s 
death. It was Mao’s way of balancing rival forces.
Nonetheless, a victim had to be found who could
be blamed for the excesses of the Red Guards.
From the highest ranks of the Politburo, Maochose his intended successor, Lin Biao, ministerof defence since 1960. Accused of plotting to
assassinate Mao, Lin Biao was never brought 
to trial, and died conveniently in an air crash in
1971, allegedly while trying to escape.In 1975 Zhou Enlai fell seriously ill. Mao, whorecognised Deng’s abilities, delegated to him the
running of the state, despite the hostility of the
Gang of Four. Zhou Enlai died the followingyear, in April 1976, but Deng’s ascendancy wasshort-lived. Thousands of people demonstrated inBeijing’s Tiananmen Square, ostensibly to mourn
the death of Zhou Enlai but in reality protesting
against the repression of the ultra-left. There were
scufﬂes with police and the square was cleared byforce, an uneasy precedent for what was tohappen there thirteen years later.Between 1970 and 1974 the economic recov-ery was proceeding in ﬁts and starts. This did not
deﬂect the party leadership from making grand
plans for the future. At the Fourth NationalPeople’s Congress in January 1975 Zhou Enlaiproclaimed that the country’s objective now was
to catch up with the developed world by the end
of the century by concentrating on the ‘four
moderns’: the modernisation of agriculture, ofindustry, of national defence and of science andtechnology. But within the constraints of Mao’s
ideology such results could not be attained. It
would be left to Mao’s heirs to try new ways of
achieving the necessary growth.What has subsequently been called the secondphase of the Cultural Revolution continued to
disrupt China. Some 12 million students, profes-
sionals and intellectuals had been sent into the
countryside to be educated in the realities of
Chinese peasant life. Many unjust imprisonmentswere upheld. Education and science were dis-
rupted; schools and universities only gradually
reopened in the 1970s. The see-saw policies of
Mao’s hierarchy inﬂicted untold hardship and suf-
fering on millions of Chinese. They wouldremember the decade from 1966 to 1976 as theyears of great turmoil.Yet there were also, at least in principle, somebeneficial aspects. The relocation of industrial
activity throughout China, away from the manu-

facturing cities of the southern China coast spurreda more even development and mitigated the ThirdWorld phenomenon of developing mega-cities
unable to cope with the population inﬂux. Had

there been more rational planning, with transport
and communications keeping pace and with theolder urban centres being maintained and renewedas necessary instead of suffering from neglect,
China’s economic development would have suf-

fered less from Mao’s Cultural Revolution. As it1THE LAST YEARS OF MAO AND HIS HEIRS617
was Mao’s faith in the power of ideology created afatal impediment.It is remarkable that one branch of technologynevertheless held its own during the decade when
intellectuals were most ﬁercely persecuted: that
was the missile and atomic-bomb sector. AfterRussia’s withdrawal from the nuclear programme,Chinese scientists went ahead on their own, and
in October 1964 China exploded its own atomic
bomb, becoming the ﬁfth nuclear power in the
world. Two years later guided missiles provided a
delivery system. By 1967 China had built the evenmore terrible hydrogen bomb. Three years laterit sent up its ﬁrst satellite and in 1975 launched
a retrievable model. Chinese missiles are among
the most reliable.One of the most startling developments ofMao’s last years was the reorientation of China’sforeign policy. Relations with the Soviet Union
had gone from bad to worse after Khrushchev’s
fall, and in March 1969 there was actually hand-
to-hand ﬁghting over an insigniﬁcant island in themiddle of the River Ussuri claimed by both theRussians and the Chinese. But the border dispute
on the Soviet Paciﬁc along the Amur and Ussuri
rivers was less a cause than a symptom of Sino-
Soviet hostility, with Brezhnev in the 1970s sta-
tioning some of Russia’s best divisions on theborder, complete with nuclear-missile installa-tions. The Chinese anyway knew that they were
no match for the Russians. Mao interpreted Soviet
foreign policy as entering a new imperialist era,
and he could cite as evidence the BrezhnevDoctrine, which was used to justify the invasion ofCzechoslovakia in 1968. The US by contrast had
in Mao’s view become overstretched and in the
early 1970s was looking for a way out of Vietnam.
Mao saw in the American–Soviet rivalry a contra-
diction that China might exploit: he was now pre-pared to seek agreement with the country that hadhitherto been China’s main antagonist – the US.
In Washington, President Nixon and Henry
Kissinger also saw a chance to create a better bal-
ance of power against the Soviet Union by playingthe China card.It began in a characteristically Chinese fashionwith an agreement early in 1971 for a US table-
tennis team to visit China. This was the ﬁrst direct
link between the two countries. The US still recog-
nised Chiang Kai-shek’s regime in Taiwan as thelegitimate Republic of China, and its representa-

tives occupied China’s place on the UN Security
Council. In July, Kissinger, President Nixon’s
national security adviser, journeyed secretly toBeijing. This paved the way for one of the mostmomentous U-turns in the history of international
relations.President Nixon, Mrs Nixon, William Rogers,the secretary of state, and Kissinger ﬂew to Beijing

for discussions and negotiations with Mao andZhou Enlai in February 1972. The outcome wasincorporated in a joint US–Chinese communiqué
published in Shanghai on 28 February in which the
American and Chinese signatories declared that
they wished to normalise relations between thetwo countries. They reviewed the world situation,and the Americans and Chinese each issued a state-

ment of their own. Despite different ideologies,
the US document declared, no country was infalli-

ble. The US stressed its commitment to freedomand to support for South Vietnam and SouthKorea. The Chinese countered that oppression
bred resistance, that strong nations should not
bully the weak: ‘China will never be a superpower
and it opposes hegemony and power politics of any
kind.’ The Chinese expressed their ﬁrm support for
the peoples of Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia (herethe Chinese took the opposite side to the US), but
declared they both wished to reduce the danger of
international conﬂict and did not seek hegemony.

The touchiest and most crucial difference was overthe future of Taiwan, so long allied to the US. TheChinese uncompromisingly declared Taiwan to be
an internal question and insisted that Taiwan as a
province of China should return to the mother-

land. They also demanded that US forces be with-

drawn from the island. The Americans agreed thatthere was but one China – a point, they addedtartly, that Taiwan and Beijing had in common.
The US wanted to see a peaceful settlement and
gave a momentous if somewhat vague undertak-

ing: ‘it afﬁrms the ultimate objective of the with-
drawal of all US forces and military installationsfrom Taiwan’.In December 1978 full diplomatic relationswere resumed between Beijing and Washington.618TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
America’s trade embargo had long ended andChina had taken its place fully in the internationalcommunity, replacing Taiwan’s representative as
a permanent member of the UN Security
Council. Relations with the West were nor-
malised, a process that began with the SovietUnion only in the late 1980s. Thus the openingto the West had begun under Mao’s auspices in
the 1970s. It was to reach a high point in the
1980s, with many thousands of Chinese students
being sent abroad – most to the capitalist US,
where over 20,000 were sent to study advancedtechnology and management. Deng’s youngerson studied for his doctorate at Rochester
University. It was an ironic reversal: in the 1950s
it had been the Soviet Union that had provided
the education.Mao’s immediate successor, chosen as chairmanby the geriatric Politburo, was an orthodox
Maoist, Hua Guofeng. His most signiﬁcant con-
tribution was to drive the Gang of Four, that isthe extreme left, from the most powerful posi-tions. We can only guess at the struggles within
the Politburo that led to Deng’s recall to his
former posts in 1977. Natural disasters, which
struck the countryside in 1977 and 1978, slowed
down the economic recovery then under way andprobably helped the reformist section of thePolitburo. A distinguished Chinese historian has
called the third plenary session of the Eleventh
Party Central Committee held in December 1978
‘a turning point of far-reaching signiﬁcance’. Huawas dismissed from his position as party chairmanin 1978, accused of persisting in the ‘two what-
evers’ – that is, of wanting to uphold whatever
policy decisions Mao had made and whatever
directives Mao had sent down.A main plank of Marxist strategy was nowabandoned with the dropping of the ‘class strug-gle’ as the key to development and the shift to
‘socialist modernisation’. What this meant in
reality, despite lip service to Maoist thinking, was
a break with Mao’s revolutionary drives, foundedon the belief that the creation of communist manmust come ﬁrst through education and the organ-
isation of the peasantry in collectives and workers
into state-managed enterprises. The beneﬁts ofwell-being and economic progress were supposedto follow automatically. It was now thought thatthe prime task was to modernise China, to do
whatever was necessary to increase production on
the land and in industry as rapidly as possible so
as to raise within a generation the Chinese stan-dard of living from one of the lowest in the worldto rank with that of the West. The new line
(which had to be sloganised to conform to polit-
ical practice) was called ‘Seeking truth from facts’.
Where Marxist ideology proved a hindrance it
would be jettisoned. This indeed was a revolu-tionary change of course, though gradual in exe-cution. The party, whose standing had reached
rock-bottom during the Cultural Revolution, was
to be restored to pre-eminence, to ensure that the
reforms decided by the leadership would becarried through; and the People’s LiberationArmy was cosseted to ensure that it would remain
the loyal instrument of power and preserve order,
unity and obedience to the party leadership.
Democracy in the Western sense of pluralism andof a leadership chosen by the people played nopart in this programme – indeed, demands for
such things were seen as jeopardising the aims of
modernisation, as destroying the essential unity of
purpose.Deng Xiaoping, the man who represented thenew line and who had already played a signiﬁcantrole in attempting to make China more modern
economically, belonged to that elderly group of
revolutionaries who had been active in the 1950s.
The open distancing from Mao’s supposed infal-libility was signalled by subjecting the Gang ofFour to a televised trial in 1980 in order to expose
the wrongdoings of the Cultural Revolution.
Jiang Quing, Mao’s widow, alone offered a spir-
ited defence, refusing to admit any guilt: ‘You
can’t have peaceful coexistence in this area of ide-ology’, she spat out. ‘Youcoexist, and they’llcorrupt you.’ She was sentenced to death, but this
was later commuted to life imprisonment. As a
symbol of the Cultural Revolution she became
the most hated woman in China. Meanwhile, ayounger generation of politicians had been placedin the top positions: Hu Yaobang became party
leader and Zhao Ziyang the head of government,
both of them reformist followers of Deng. Deng1THE LAST YEARS OF MAO AND HIS HEIRS619
himself eschewed Mao’s personality cult, thoughas a member of the Politburo in charge of thearmy he was careful to counter the ‘old guard’ of
conservatives, who remained powerful and strong,
ready to make a comeback should his reforms fail
or loosen party control or threaten China’s unity.So it can be seen that Deng’s position could notbe compared to Mao’s. When public protests
became too strong, Deng himself was ready to
back a more conservative line.Deng’s reforms of the political structure werenever intended to create a Western-style democ-racy, which he condemned as ‘bourgeois liberal-ism’. But without some reforms of the existing
structures his economic programme would fail.
For years he manipulated the factions in China
with the skill of a poker player. Just so much crit-icism had to be encouraged to galvanise corruptor inefﬁcient party bureaucrats and the patronage
system which placed a premium on who you
knew. Between 1982 and 1985 slow but steady
progress was made in weeding out those who hadbecome too old or were too incompetent, usuallyby offering generous retirement terms. At a special
national party conference in September 1985, half
the Politburo was retired and a ﬁfth of the Central
Committee. Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang and
Zhao Ziyang now had a majority vote in thePolitburo. At this point Deng had probablyreached the height of his inﬂuence and power.Deng could also look back on a remarkablysuccessful start to his programme of economic
reform in education and technological progress,but most especially in agriculture. Socialism wasgradually modiﬁed and the peasant was given the
incentive of growing some of his crops for proﬁt
and of engaging in handicraft industry. The
people’s communes were replaced between 1979
and 1984 by a new system which, in practice,returned the land to the peasantry under a con-tract, called a lease, hardly distinguishable from
private ownership. The contract had been used
before for short periods to revive agricultural
output, but now it became the system adopted in place of the collectives. Contracts were madewith individual households: taxes had to be paid
and an agreed amount of grain had to be sold to
the state, but beyond this the household (orgroups of peasants) could keep whatever theycould earn. Efficient households soon becamequasi-landlords, employing sometimes as many as
a hundred peasant labourers.Prices were raised. There was a boom in someregions of China as the successful farmers builtthemselves large houses and bought consumergoods never before seen in the countryside –
colour television sets and refrigerators. Rural
enterprises and factories also developed and some
owners became rich. What mattered most to the
state, however, was the increase in agriculturalproduction, which in the years after 1979 wasspectacular, starting as it did from the low base
of the collectives. By 1984 Deng’s agricultural
reforms appeared to have vindicated his approach.The reform of state factories and urban enter-prises took off later, in the mid-1980s, Denghaving given priority to the agricultural reforms.
The reformers now turned to free industry from
state shackles and to devolve responsibility to the
factory manager; here, too, the proﬁt motive wasdesigned to provide incentives. Small, privatelyowned enterprises were encouraged. By 1987 20
million one-family undertakings had been started.
But the most startling reform was the develop-
ment of what were called ‘special economic
zones’ – capitalist enclaves within socialist China.Though the West had exploited China in thenineteenth and early twentieth centuries, estab-
lishing Western enclaves in China, the treaty ports
and concessions, these had also been a channel by
which Western management and technology weretransferred to China. The most successful of theseinternational concessions had existed in Shanghai,
whose trading and commercial pre-eminence in
China was due to the presence of the Westerner.
But the communists had reasserted Chinese sov-
ereignty and driven out the West from all theenclaves. For a decade the Soviet Union had ﬁlledthe gap as educator, but then it also withdrew.
Deng and the reformers wanted to bring Western
knowledge and capital back to China. That was
the purpose of the Special Enterprise Zones. Onesuch, Shenzhen, was placed strategically acrossthe frontiers of Hong Kong, the prime example
of what a combination of Chinese skill and the
capitalist system could achieve. Favourable condi-620TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
tions and the availability of cheap Chinese labourattracted large-scale investment from HongKong. No doubt Deng was trying to kill two
birds with one stone. By showing that capitalism
and socialism could exist side by side he furthered
the reuniﬁcation of all of China – the Britishcolony of Hong Kong, the Portuguese enclave ofMacao and hostile Taiwan. Most of Hong Kong
would revert to China when the British lease
ended. In 1984 the British and Chinese govern-
ments concluded an agreement that embodied
Deng’s formula ‘one country, two systems’. Afterthe British lease ended in 1997 Hong Kongwould be allowed to maintain its capitalist system
and its freedoms for fifty years as a Special
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic.While it seemed that Deng and the reformerswere transforming China, opening the country tothe West, attracting tourists and foreign capital,
developing new joint enterprises and placing
orders for machines and whole factories with the
US, Britain, West Germany and other countries,problems were emerging which, in 1989, were toplace question marks over Deng’s decade of
reform.Free-enterprise agriculture was concentratingon the production of more proﬁtable crops than
grain, such as jute and tobacco. In 1985 grainproduction fell as China’s population, despiteintensive birth-control campaigns enforcing ‘one
couple, one child’, inexorably grew. Greater pro-
ductivity on the land meant less need for labour.
China’s urban population almost doubledbetween 1980 and 1986 – another 180 millionmouths to feed in the cities. There was under-
employment and unemployment in the cities;
housing shortages grew more severe. The mixed
state and free market encouraged corruption.
Favouritism and bribery became widespread.Price rises unsettled the population, more used tothe stability of stagnation. Economic develop-

ment has been uneven, fastest in the last 1980s
in the coastal cities. Agricultural output from
what are predominantly small farms has littlescope to increase and so match China’s popula-tion growth. With an economy in which prices are
not yet market-oriented there is confusion and
dislocation. Corruption is rife and China is stilloverburdened with a vast bureaucracy, whoseplanning functions continue to shrink. Vestedinterests damaged by these changes did their best
to slow up or undermine Deng’s reforms.The biggest problem was Deng’s recognitionof the need to transform the attitudes of the indi-vidual Chinese, to make them more independent-thinking, responsible and enterprising. To the
extent that he succeeded he also raised expec-
tations beyond what the party could fulfil.Educational reform created a larger professionalclass and more idealistic students, who demanded
new freedoms and ‘democracy’. This set Deng’s
reformers and the party leadership on a collisioncourse with a vociferous, educated, urban minor-ity which wanted political reforms on the Western
model. The West had come to expect more from
the Chinese leadership as China’s economic anddiplomatic involvement with the rest of the worldhad grown. Tourists visited China and found its
people generous and friendly; Beijing even
allowed discreet nightclubs to open, offering theservices of hostesses. It looked as if China wouldadopt the Western way of life, importing not only
Western capital and goods but also some of the
West’s values. But in 1989 the Chinese leadershipshowed a different face that should have beenexpected. The West recoiled with horror but only
for a short time.In the China of the twentieth century there is atradition of student and intellectual protest. The
calendar is marked by events such as the anti-
foreigner demonstrations of 4 May 1919, whichbecame the focus for new demonstrations in the1980s. Student idealism and frustrations were
manipulated from time to time by the aged party
leadership against their rivals, not least by Maohimself, with the launch of the Red Guards in1966. It was a dangerous tactic and those who
used student protest for their own purposes then
had to contain what they had helped to arouse.
Deng and his chosen successor, the man he hadplaced in the position of party leader, Hu Yaobang,together with the head of the government Zhao
Ziyang, decided to allow freer expression of views.
Deng, however, kept his lines open to the moreconservative aged Politburo in deploring decadentWestern ‘bourgeois’ inﬂuences.
1THE LAST YEARS OF MAO AND HIS HEIRS621
It was not surprising that China’s studentswere in the forefront of protest and demonstra-tions. They lived in bad conditions and were
rigidly controlled by their elders. Their future
usually lay in the hands of the state or party
machine, which would assign them to a job some-where in China – possibly in the wildest, mostremote regions. Added to the instinctive desire of
youth to be free of the restrictions imposed by an
older generation, to ﬁnd new solutions to long-
lasting problems, was a growing impatience with
party politicising, with corruption and withrepression. The old certainties enshrined withinMao’s infallibility had been replaced by a jumble
of ideas. The rapid pace of economic change and
contact with foreigners, with foreign literature
and with some of their teachers, who bravelyspoke their minds, all created a ferment of unrest.In the winter of 1986 the students took to the
streets and gathered in Tiananmen Square.
Economic reforms were not enough – they
wanted control over their own lives. The demandwas for ‘democracy’, symbolised on their bannersby the Statue of Liberty. It was a spontaneous
expression of feeling; but the students had no
notion of how a transition to democracy might
be managed in the prevailing conditions of China.
They were brave and impetuous, and rejectedDeng’s cautious approach to greater freedomsand prosperity which was then producing more
dislocation than progress. The student protest
was contained and dispersed without undue vio-
lence. The hardliners in the Politburo may wellhave regarded this as misplaced tolerance.Deng’s economic reforms, which encouragedmore choice and freedom in the lives of the
Chinese, were blamed for these dangerous
demands for political freedoms, which challenged
the role of the party and its leaders. Deng couldnot stop halfway on the road of economic reform,but he agreed with the conservatives that liberty of
expression could not be allowed at this critical
stage to affect the leadership’s ﬁrm control of pol-
icy decisions. The man he was thought to havechosen as his successor, the pragmatic reformistHu Yaobang, was removed from the leadership of
the party but not from the Politburo. In the
course of 1987 Deng managed to readjust the bal-ance between reformers and conservatives whilepressing ahead with economic modernisation andencouraging Western capitalism to invest in
China. Hu Yaobang’s position was taken by Zhao
Ziyang, whose administrative skills were intended
to help reform the party and to rid it of corrup-tion. A younger Politburo member, Li Peng, acolourless Moscow-educated technocrat, was
placed at the head of the state administration. In a
wily masterstroke Deng retired from his posts and
thereby persuaded many of the ageing conserva-
tive members of the Politburo to retire with him.But a secret party agreement acknowledged thathe would continue to take major party decisions.Rapid change caused increasing economicproblems in 1988 and 1989. Price inflation
reached 30 per cent; with the new economic free-doms, some did well, but the army, the hundredsof thousands of party and state ofﬁcials and all
who derived their income from state salaries were
left behind. The disadvantaged began to see
Chinese society as increasingly unjust; foodqueues in Beijing were painful evidence of agricul-tural shortfalls and corruption. It was the example
of Gorbachev’s bold policy of glasnostand hisimpending visit to Beijing that enthused the stu-
dents in the spring of 1989 to demonstrate and to
demand political reform. Countless banners inTiananmen Square celebrated the ‘Pioneer ofGlasnost’ and hailed the Soviet leader as an‘Emissary of Democracy’. Gorbachev’s arrival in
May was, in itself, a turning point in China’s inter-
national relations. At the end of a chaotic four-dayvisit, Deng and Gorbachev announced that afterthirty years of hostility the relations between
China and the Soviet Union had been normalised.
But no very specific evidence of collaboration
emerged. The visit was in any case overshadowed
by the dramatic events outside the Great Hall ofthe People in Tiananmen Square. Such turmoilhad not been seen in China since the Cultural
Revolution twenty years earlier.The students, who had been demonstratingsince April, occupied the square throughout Mayand attracted growing attention. China’s advancesin technology – television and satellite links –
vividly conveyed this mass protest, with its
demand for democracy and an end to the exclu-622TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
sive role of the corrupt party, to the whole world.Buoyed by public support, the students escalatedthe confrontation, humiliating to the Politburo
holed up in the Great Hall, by going on hunger-
strike. For seven weeks the Chinese leadership tol-
erated the students’ occupation of the square.China seemed truly to have changed.Inside the Great Hall of the People a powerstruggle was going on between the party leader
Zhao Ziyang and the more hardline premier Li
Peng. The proclamation of martial law on 20 May
and the recall to the Politburo of four octo-genarian revolutionaries indicated that Deng wasready to use as much force as necessary but
needed to wait until the crucial Gorbachev visit
had ended. He was also aware of the immense
damage a bloody crackdown would do to theimage of a reforming China, just when with itseconomic troubles mounting he needed Western
help more than ever. Might the army prove unre-
liable, even though he was head of the Military
Commission? An early attempt to use troops sta-tioned in Beijing failed. More ominously workerswent on strike and the students began to secure
mass support. In a ﬁnal show of deﬁance they
erected in the square a plaster Goddess of Liberty,
which looked much like the American Statue of
Liberty. Deng ordered thousands of troops fromoutlying parts of China to Beijing. These youngrecruits had no idea what was really at issue; still
less had they any idea who they were being
ordered to suppress as dangerous revolutionaries.
The students massing in the square could notbelieve that the People’s Liberation Army couldbe prepared to harm their fellow Chinese, young
men and women the same age as they. In a dra-
matic last bid Zhao Ziyang tearfully tried to
placate the students.During the early hours of Sunday, 4 June 1989the army with tanks and guns fired on thoseunarmed students who would not leave the
square. The massacre, in which hundreds were
killed, was witnessed by the world as courageous
television crews and reporters provided live cov-erage of the bloodshed, of students rushingcorpses and the wounded on their improvised
bicycle ambulances to Beijing’s hospitals. The
hospitals, unable to cope, simply stacked thecorpses in the corridors. All Sunday the soldiersﬁred indiscriminately, killing men, women andchildren, often bystanders unconnected to the
demonstration. For days Beijing was at the mercy
of the military. The striking workers were threat-
ened and made to return to work. In thePolitburo the students were condemned as revo-lutionaries, and a conspiracy manipulated by
outside forces hostile to China was ‘uncovered’.
The massacre was simply denied and the demon-
strators were accused of killing the soldiers – it
was true that in their fury the crowds had savagelyburnt some trucks and killed the few occupantsthey could lay their hands on. The troubles had
spread to other cities as well. In Shanghai there
were massive demonstrations, but there blood-
shed was avoided.In the immediate aftermath student leaders anddemonstrators were arrested. The universities
emptied as students and staff dispersed, their
future uncertain. A number of public trials were
televised and sentences of execution pronounced.A hunt for student leaders and supporters of thedemocracy movement, now branded revolution-
aries, began. Zhao Ziyang was ousted as party
chief and placed under house arrest. Li Peng
became the spokesman for the hardliners. But the
power struggle was not over even as China out-wardly returned to normality. Deng, as an octo-genarian, could not be expected to retain power
for much longer. With the population still1THE LAST YEARS OF MAO AND HIS HEIRS623
Beijing demonstrators, 1989. © Patrick Zachmann/Magnum Photosgrowing despite birth-control campaigns – it hadincreased from 540 million in 1949 to 1,300million by the year 2000 – the need to increase
production through modernisation was indis-

pensable. China was poised between free enter-
prise and socialist planning, between some fragileindividual freedoms and party control, governedby a small band of political leaders locked in 
strife with each other. Despite the progress made
since 1949, it still faced a very difﬁcult future.
Thousands of the best-educated Chinese had been
alienated into secret opposition, yet they were thevery young men and women most needed to makemodernisation possible. The brutal use of the
People’s Army against the people had opened up
a breach that would take time to heal.The issue of whether economic reform andmodernisation had to precede fundamental polit-ical change, as Deng believed, or whether eco-
nomic reforms had reached the stage where they
could be carried no further without political
reform, had been decided. What China’s leadersbelieved was that to have given way to demandsfor ‘democracy’ would have plunged China into
chaos and disruption, and quite probably blood-
shed on a large scale. Control and discipline would
be needed as the precondition of material
progress. They saw no reason why one-party con-trol could not sit comfortably with the expansionof what has come to be called the socialist market
economy. The economic progress achieved since
1989 has proved many a pessimistic Western the-orist wrong. Politically, the events of 1989 dis-pelled much facile optimism in the West. Forsome months the West cut off relations with
China. In Hong Kong there was greater anxiety
about what the Anglo-Chinese settlement held in
store. But China was too important a vast countrywith prospects for proﬁtable business, a player in Asian international relations also hopefully 
able to restrain North Korea, its vote on the
Security Council too crucial, for the West to main-
tain the ostracism. So, despite everything, realism
demanded a gradual normalisation of Westerndealings with China in 1990. The Chinese leader-ship was careful to avoid further offence and
demonstrated goodwill towards the West by back-
ing the Security Council resolutions against Iraq
after the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. TheChinese leadership managed to insulate theircountry from the upheavals that had swept com-
munist Eastern Europe and brought enormous
changes to the Soviet Union. In China the pace of
reform is set from above.In China’s vast interior, trials of dissidents,sentences of execution and incarceration were
meted out as a harsh lesson after June 1989.
Obedience to party and leadership were not to be
challenged. China would continue to be ruled
politically by the Communist Party and its leadersas before. The leaders would decide on the limitsof debate and intellectual freedom. There has
been liberalisation since the 1990s; visitors were
welcomed and students continue to study abroad.624TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949

Dissent is kept under wraps.One explanation is the booming economy andrising standards of living, faster since the 1990s
in the cities than in the countryside. The senior
leader, Deng Xiaoping, observed with satisfactionthat he had chosen the right course. Political lib-eralisation, perestroika, in the Soviet Union hadaccompanied economic reform, and made com-
mercial modernisation infinitely more difficult
and led to conﬂict and the disintegration of the
Soviet state. The Chinese people would be lessconcerned with notions of Western-style democ-racy if the party could deliver higher standards of
living, and a plentiful supply of enticing consumer
goods. Beijing has been transformed, with its
modern hotels, department stores, foreign goods,Benetton sweaters and monied inhabitants.China’s immense land mass is divided between
some wealthy regions and impoverished lands.
The Fourteenth Communist Party Congress
which met in October 1992 conﬁrmed the policythe 89-year-old Deng had tenaciously followedfor ﬁfteen years: the transition to a mixed social-
ist market economy, called for appearance’s sake
‘the socialist market economy’, presided over by
a communist party with a monopoly of political
power. China was going its own way yet again.The spectacular growth of China’s economyrepresents a tantalising opportunity for Western
business; a whole new frontier appeared to be
opening up. But Western governments have had
to grapple with the dilemma of dealing with aregime whose human rights record is at the sametime condemned by them. Can moral principles
outweigh national interest when the furtherance
of trade contributes to prosperity and employ-
ment at home? The Clinton administration faced
this issue by granting Chinese exports unhinderedaccess to the US market in order to secureimprovements in the way the Chinese authorities
treated their dissidents. Success has been limited.
For Britain, compelled to hand over the colony
in 1997, Hong Kong was an Achilles heel.Belated attempts to introduce democratic ele-ments in government were met by a furious reac-
tion in Beijing and threats to dismantle what had
been done without China’s approval.With the death of Deng in February 1997China’s leaders have to grapple with China’senormous problems of modernisation, with the
uneven development of the regions, with corrup-
tion, but also with millions of people who for the
ﬁrst time have access to information about life inthe West. Satellite dishes and the Internet may inthe end prove more powerful than tanks. The
Fifteenth Congress gathered in September 1997.
The vast Hall of the People was ﬁlled to capacity
with delegates applauding in unison and voting as
one. Flanked by ﬂowers, China’s leaders deliveredtheir speeches from the raised platform. Thisstage-managed scene, transmitted through-
out China and all over the world, demonstrated
the unity of purpose of a monolithic nation.
However, these images were a distortion of thetruth. China has had to cope with serious ten-sions. A rapid and uneven transformation, the
reult of Deng’s drive to bring about accelerated
development, widened the gap between the
coastal regions and middle China and created dif-ferences even between neighbouring districts.Rapid growth caused inﬂation in the early 1990s
and was followed by austerity before growth
could be resumed. The path followed in politics,
by way of contrast, was steady repression. With
the crushing of the Tiananmen DemocracyProtest movement in 1989, the search for polit-ical reform was over. Deng believed that the
Chinese people would be diverted and reconciled
to party rule by increased prosperity. As long as
criticism was judged ‘constructive’ within narrowlimits a small measure of individual freedom ofexpression was allowed – but only if the funda-
mental aims of the party and the leadership
remained unchallenged. Democracy, the tolera-
tion of an opposition, has remained anathema.
Amid all the problems caused by China’s trans-formation, the Politburo in Beijing feared that ifit lost its grip chaos would ensue – provinces
would take their fate in their own hands,
Tibetans, Mongolians and the non-Han Chinese
in border regions would rise up and ﬁght forindependence, and in the heart of China tensionscould escalate into rural rebellions.There have been large economic gains sincethe 1990s but they have been unequally shared.1THE LAST YEARS OF MAO AND HIS HEIRS625
Of China’s 1.2 billion people, 850 million live inthe countryside. Heavy taxation, corruption andnepotism have resulted in a breakdown of trust
between peasants and the party. In the 1980s and
early 1990s John Gittings, one of the best-
informed China-watchers, made several journeysinto the interior, far from the burgeoning ‘specialeconomic zones’ and coastal cities. His ﬁndings
have been collected in a remarkable book, RealChina, in which he describes the chaos caused byChina’s rapid development particularly in its
impact on the peasantry. Some 80 million peas-ants, driven by poverty, migrated to the citieswhere they form a virtually inexhaustible cheap
source of labour; those who don’t find work
aggravate the many urban social ills, especially
vagrancy and crime. In the countryside unem-ployment remains the most serious problem; herethe directives from Beijing were often ignored by
local ofﬁcials, and the peasants resorted to massive
protests and riots. In 1993 alone 750,000 ‘inci-
dents’ were ofﬁcially reported. Under such con-ditions the response of the Chinese leadershipappeared almost reckless. It was given at the
Fifteenth Party Congress by Jiang Zemin, 
president of China since 1993, who emerged as
China’s strongman; backed by the Politburo, he
seemed set to follow in the footsteps of Deng.China plans to accelerate the pace of marketreforms and to privatise the 17,000 medium and
small state-owned industries that were creating
huge deﬁcits. Those that could not be made to
pay their way would be shut down. Only anumber of large key industries, such as thosemanufacturing military hardware, would remain
in state hands. Millions of workers will be thrown
out of work and join the unemployed, a recipe
for unrest that will test the iron hand of state
control. The hitherto unswerving support of thearmy, which is to be reduced in size but mod-ernised, will be a critical factor.China’s policy of rapid economic developmentalso depends on access to world markets on equal
terms and on the continuing inﬂow of Westerninvestment and technology. China had not yetbeen accepted as a member of the World Trade
Organisation, not granted permanent ‘most
favoured nation’ status by the US; the annualrenewal of this concession requires congressionalapproval, which meant that China’s human rightsrecord and its role in assisting Pakistan’s nuclear
weapons programme (despite having signed the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992) could
be called into question. Clinton was prepared tobe helpful. Eager to promote trading opportuni-ties for American companies, he believed in
engaging China rather than isolating it. In 1994
he had already uncoupled threats of trading sanc-
tions from the issue of human rights. When, three
years later, in September 1997 Jiang Zemin paidan unofﬁcial state visit to the US, the ﬁrst madeby any leader since the Tiananmen Square mas-
sacre, a deal was struck. Jiang Zemin gave no
ground publicly on human rights; he undertook
only to supervise more carefully the export ofnuclear materials and missiles. Such assurances fellshort of prohibition, but Clinton achieved his
objective of winning an order for ﬁfty Boeing jets
and authorised the proﬁtable sale of American
nuclear reactors to China.Authoritarian China was ready to master, ifnecessary by force, the dislocations caused by its
dynamic industrial development. The party main-
tained its controlling role. After the Tiananmen
Square killings any thought of political reform,
which was limited in any case to creating moreseparation between the government and theparty, has quietly been dropped. The party
derived its legitimacy from bettering living stan-
dards and economic growth. Deng’s path of eco-
nomic liberalisation, the gradual move toward amarket economy was continued and internation-ally China is opening to global competition. An
important step forward was joining the World
Trade Organisation. The huge country with its
ethnic minorities and disparities of wealth
between the booming coast and the interiorwhere two-thirds of the population, 1.2 billionpeople, live faces the risks of instability not least
from the economic course chosen which has
created 25 million unemployed as inefﬁcient state
industries shed workers.In China personal freedoms have increased aslong as they do not challenge the party. That
material aims and dry Marxist dialectic was not
enough, however, was demonstrated by the aston-626TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
ishing growth of a cult in the 1990s, the FalunGong which mixes Buddhist and Taoist beliefswith traditional physical involvements, to lead
people on the path of enlightenment. It is a peace-
ful spiritual movement which, according to some
estimates, at its height gained 60 million follow-ers. They protested and ‘exercised’ in Beijing’sparks when the party ordered their suppression.The basic consensus among the party leadersdid not exclude rivalries between them over the
spoils of ofﬁce, of power and material beneﬁts.
The price of one-party rule over the decades hasbeen endemic corruption reaching down to thelowest party ofﬁcials in the countryside. Periodic
campaigns to eradicate it have only temporary
beneﬁcial effects while the cronies of those in
power continue to enjoy protection. Thousandsless fortunate were sent to trial and labour camps.In China the movement has been destroyed in the
open and only persists underground among the
most determined of its followers. The cult,
however, is popular especially among ethnicChinese, in the US attracting devotees who pub-licly exercise in parks without hindrance.Internationally Taiwan remained a focus ofconﬂict. The US is anxious to restrain both sides
from turning a war of words into real conﬂict.
Taiwan invests indirectly in business ventures inmainland China and personal contacts, people topeople, are growing. Taiwan as an economic
model of success has much to offer mainland
China. For the People’s Republic good relations
with its two most powerful neighbours Russia andthe US are essential to ensure its economicprogress. The People’s Republic has become 
an inﬂuence for peace in the region out of self-
interest. A good example was Beijing’s efforts to
facilitate a resolution in 2003 over the clash
between the US and North Korea when itsleaders announced their nuclear weapons pro-gramme. In the midst of momentous change,
China’s leaders are haunted by the fear that they
could lose control, and instability and chaos
would result. They certainly look like being ableto maintain the ediﬁce in the forseeable future. Atthe top there is a consensus on China’s priorities:
ﬁrst comes the need to maintain unity of this vast
and varied country which looks back on the ﬁrsthalf of the century as the disastrous era of divi-sion and foreign domination, decades of misery.During the four months between the Com-munist Party Congress in November 2002 and 
the (State) National People’s Congress in March
2003 there was a change in the leadership, less
complete than it appeared. Jiang Zemin stepped
down as secretary-general of the Communist Party
and his deputy Hu Jintao replaced him. All but
one member of an increased nine-member
Politburo Standing Committee were newly pro-
moted. Jiang hung on to power ensuring that
two-thirds of the Standing Committee were his
allies and he remained head of the Party CentralMilitary Commission, in fact, supreme head of thearmy. Jiang had the party adopt his addition to its
ideology, his theory of the ‘Three Represents’,
which for the ﬁrst time allowed private business-
men to join the party. In March 2003 at the
National People’s Congress, the State Presidency
passed from Jiang to Hu, in 2004 Jiang gave up
his remaining positions of authority. Zhu Rongji
who had experience at directing the economy was
replaced by Wen Ziabao as prime minister. Wen
owed his appointment to having shed the pre-
Tiannanmen Square sympathy with reform. Aged
seventy-six, Jiang remains the paramount leader
seeking to follow the example of Deng withoutenjoying anything like Deng’s standing. The new team has to face the formidable problems of
an economy that grows fast, unevenly on a weak
infrastructure, with an inadequate commercial
legal system, state banks overloaded with loans in
default and non-performing state industries.
There is corruption that is hard to limit, a rural
population that is backward and will have to face
world competition in foodstuffs, whose standard
of living has advanced little if at all, and a middle
class on the coast, which in cities such as Shanghai
can consume luxuries ordinary Chinese people can
only dream about. In recent years a new problem
that has to be faced is the spread of AIDS.China cannot at the same time follow an aggres-sive international policy that would jeopardise
investment from abroad and hinder trade. The
rhetoric is ﬁerce about Taiwan, the ‘renegade’1THE LAST YEARS OF MAO AND HIS HEIRS627
province, but action is limited to threats andwarnings. The possibility that the Chinese willattack Taiwan has lost credibility. When the US
recognised the People’s Republic as China’s legit-
imate government it did not abandon Taiwan.
The US Congress passed the Taiwan RelationsAct promising to ‘resist’ any resort to force. Thecommitment was dramatically tested in the Spring
of 1996. The Taiwanese president, Lee Teng-hui,
elected in 1988 was seeking re-election. He was
a change from the old-style authoritarian leaders,
his aim to move Taiwan out of the time warp, thepretence that it represented the whole of Chinaand that the communists on the mainland lacked
all legitimacy their victory in 1949 notwithstand-
ing. He appeared to be on the verge of declaring
Taiwanese independence if re-elected. Beijingopened a campaign to intimidate the Taiwaneseand frighten them by firing missiles into the 
sea. The US countered by moving two aircraft-
carriers into the South China Sea. The message
was clear: the Chinese use of force against Taiwanwould meet armed resistance. The stand-off wasdiffused as quickly as it had begun. China backedoff. Following the return of Hong Kong on the
1 July 1997, China has sought to win back
Taiwan on the same basis – ‘one country, two
systems’. However, Taiwan’s 22 million peoplecould not be won over either by threats or byblandishments pointing to the continuing pros-
perity of Hong Kong. Per head of population the
Taiwanese were many times more productive than
the Chinese on the mainland and their high stan-
dard of living reflects their economic success.Politically, too, Taiwan has advanced, allowing asomewhat disorderly multi-party system.In July 1999 the earlier crisis was repeatedwhen Lee tried to bolster his chances of another
electoral victory declaring he no longer acceptedthe ‘one China’ ambiguity. A declaration of inde-pendence would open up the carefully crafted
compromise Washington had devised to paper
over the cracks. Lee did not win, Washington
stood ﬁrm. Both sides calmed down.628TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
It was intended to be a peaceful severance fromBritain that brought freedom from colonial rule
to one-ﬁfth of mankind. The massed bands of 
the Indian army and the Scottish Highlanders onparade side by side ﬁrst played ‘God Save theKing’ and then when the saffron, green and white
flag of free India was raised, with Gandhi’s 
spinning-wheel at its centre, the bands together
struck up the Indian national anthem. It was 
symbolic of the new relationship, Prime MinisterNehru asked Lord Mountbatten to stay as inde-pendent India’s first governor-general. But
independence solved only one problem, the rela-
tionship with imperial Britain. Daunting tasks
faced the new rulers; they had to maintain lawand order when the cauldron of ethnic and reli-gious animosities turned to murderous violence;
they had to deﬁne and to secure the new national
frontiers in the vacuum of power left by the
British which had not been completely ﬁlled by
the agreements reached at independence; andthey had to ﬁnd ways of raising the standard ofliving of the hundreds of millions surviving at
subsistence level in rural India and in its teeming
cities. All these things had to be tackled simulta-
neously. Ever since independence, the combina-tion of poverty, the fervour of ethnic-religiousminorities and the manipulation of politics by the
wealthier elites has resulted in a cycle of violence
that has continued for more than half a century.
Gandhi’s vision of an India where all its inhabi-tants would be brothers was not to be realised.Before 1947 it seemed only natural to supposethat British India would be replaced by the one
Commonwealth of India. But the deep divisions,
never healed during the century of British rule,proved stronger. Only by force and bloodshed was it possible to create two states in 1947. Ten
million people ﬂed and half a million perished.
Ethnic conflict and nationalism continued to
threaten the cohesion of the two successor
nations, India and Pakistan. In 1971, Bengal, theeastern region of Pakistan, rose in rebellion and,with India’s help, gained independence from West
Pakistan. The new state was called Bangladesh.
Now there were three nations.The Republic of India and the Islamic Republicof Pakistan, though facing many similar problems
of poverty and of ethnic conﬂicts within their
states and though inheriting the same British
imperial traditions and institutions, have devel-
oped very differently. With hardly a break sinceindependence, Pakistan has been ruled by abureaucratic–military alliance under an authori-
tarian military ruler, while India has preserved a
democratic framework of government. In India
the politicians have allied with the civil service toexclude the military from decision-making. Thecommander-in-chief of the Indian army is not a
member of the Cabinet, is subject to the orders
of the prime minister and defence minister and,
to make doubly certain that he can build up nopersonal power in the army, is replaced every two1Chapter 58FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN THE INDIANSUBCONTINENTINDIA, PAKISTAN AND BANGLADESH
years. The Indian army has no tradition ofmounting coups against the civilian government.Instead of authoritarian military rulers, the Nehru
family – down to and including Rajiv Gandhi –
acted for most of India’s history as a ‘dynasty’
able to win the necessary electoral support tomaintain itself in power except for short periods.India’s leaders have made it a fundamental objec-
tive of nation-building that the republic is secular
and that the majority Hindu and minority Muslim
populations enjoy equal civil rights. No ‘nation-
alism’ based on religious foundations is tolerated.Pakistan’s ofﬁcial title since the constitution of1962 is the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. But
appearances are misleading. Certain aspects of
Islam, for example the enforcing of the sharia law
with amputations and ﬂoggings, were introducedby General Zia-ul-Haq, who seized power in1977 and cloaked his military dictatorship with an
Islamic façade of respectability. His death in
August 1988 in a plane crash, probably the result
of sabotage, removed a tyrant who had orderedmore than 4,000 ﬂoggings of criminals and polit-ical opponents during his decade in power. But
under Zia the religious leaders, the ulema, had nocontrolling inﬂuence, unlike those in Khomeini’s
Islamic Iran. The exclusion of the ulemafrom themanagement of the nation’s political affairs hasbeen determinedly maintained by all Pakistan’sleaders since independence.In 1947, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the leader ofIndia’s Muslim League, was determined to estab-
lish an independent secular Muslim state if hecould not get a loosely structured, uniﬁed Indiawith circumscribed power at the centre – some-
thing Nehru and the Congress Party leaders
would not agree to. The independent alternative,
Pakistan, then became the only other means of
protecting Muslim lives and property in theIndian subcontinent. But a separate Pakistancould be justiﬁed only on ethnic and religious
grounds. The Muslim League thus had to empha-
sise religion as a ground for demanding inde-
pendence and as a basis for its appeal to theMuslims spread throughout India. There was oneMuslim to every four non-Muslims (most of
whom were Hindus), and the appeal of the
Muslim League was particularly successful incentral India, where the Muslims faced the hos-tility and discrimination of Hindu majorities. Anindependent Muslim nation would not only free
Muslims within its conﬁnes from fear but also
promised economic and social improvement for
the repressed Muslim poor. The incitement ofreligious feelings was, however, bound to be dan-gerous; it led to the fanaticism and massacres that
followed partition – consequences which the
Muslim League had desperately wished to avoid
but which were beyond their control.Thus, from the very beginning, Jinnah’ssecular Muslim state implied ambiguities. Theulemawere nevertheless powerful in the inde-pendent state and could stir up the masses against
the ruling elite, so constitution-making proved a
long-drawn-out affair. Jinnah, the father of thenation, lived for only one year after independ-ence, and during the decade from 1948 until
1958, when the military ﬁrst seized power, polit-
ical development in Pakistan was stunted by the
failure of the Muslim League to develop as a massparty – a decade characterised by the factionalismand corruption of the politicians.Nation-building was in any case going to bedifﬁcult, and there was no one of Jinnah’s stature
to take his place. Pakistan was divided into two
parts, separated by a thousand miles of the Indianland mass. In Eastern Pakistan, where the major-ity (54 per cent) of Pakistanis lived, the Muslims
were ethnically homogeneous Bengalis. In
Western Pakistan, there was ethnic diversity
among Punjabis, Sindhis, Pathans and Baluchis.The central Pakistan government, situated in thewestern half, set itself the task of dominating the
divided West and sought also to dominate the
East. In the West, more than half the population
lives in the Punjab, the remainder in four
provinces and in the capital, Islamabad. The armyand the higher civil service were predominantlyPunjabi, and the political leadership of the Muslim
League had strong roots in the refugees who had
ﬂed from India, where they had been in a minor-
ity. The building up of a mass democratic basewould have ousted the Punjabi–Muslim refugeeelite from power and handed it over to the far
more united Bengali East. But the desire to hold
on to power meant that the Punjabi–Muslim630TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
refugee elite would continue to rule with the assis-tance of the army and the higher civil service, sup-pressing ethnic nationalism and securing their
predominance over the more populous eastern
half. Here in a nutshell lies the reason for the cat-
astrophic development of Pakistan’s politics – itsundemocratic features, the army’s subversion ofcivilian government without a broad popular mass
base, and ultimately the rebellion of disadvan-
taged and resentful East Pakistan in 1971.To manipulate the constitution to their advan-tage, Pakistan’s rulers forcibly amalgamated theprovinces in the west into one West Pakistanregion which was then given an equal voice to the
more populous East Pakistan. But the constitu-
tion of 1956 caused much dissatisfaction among
the steam-rollered participants east and west. TheMuslim League politicians meanwhile could notestablish a stable civilian government based on a
parliamentary assembly. Between 1948 and 1954
the Constituent Assembly had been less than a
hundred days in session and one prime ministerhad been assassinated.The constitution of 1956 provided for elec-tions in February 1959. Provincial elections in
East Pakistan in 1954 had already shown that one
political party there, the United Front, would
carry all before it; the Muslim League had comelast, gaining only 10 of the 309 seats. In WestPakistan, with its fourfold ethnic rivalry, no single
party could hope to equal the performance of the
United Party. The United Party and East Pakistan
would thus take control of the whole country.The rulers were not prepared to accept this. In1958, General Ayub Khan extinguished parlia-
ment, ﬁrst in East Pakistan, where he had been
sent as military governor, and then in West
Pakistan, when in the same year he became head
of state. It was a military coup, but few regrettedthe passing of the self-serving politicians.President Ayub Khan invented an ingeniousconstitutional device, the indirect referendum: an
electoral college of ‘basic democrats’ was formed,
which then overwhelmingly confirmed him inofﬁce. Although power was concentrated in thepresident’s hands, he relied for day-to-day gov-
ernment on the civil service. There was no room
for political parties under the constitution hedrew up in 1962; the members of the NationalAssembly were chosen on ‘personal merit’ asjudged by the president and his advisers. The
judiciary and press were fettered, and subordi-
nated to presidential rule. Provincial autonomy,
to the extent it had survived, was brought com-pletely under central control. East Pakistan,deprived even of the rights of the 1956 constitu-
tion, erupted in riots. The political opposition
there formed the Awami League under Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman, whose proposals for a two-
nation federation landed him in jail. In theunfavoured provinces in West Pakistan, resent-ment against the Punjabi–Muslim refugee elite
which, with the army, continued to control poli-
cy and patronage under the Ayub presidency 
also produced growing unrest. Ayub’s mostcapable opponent was Zulﬁkar Ali Bhutto, whosePakistan People’s Party gathered the support in
the provinces of both rural and urban groups dis-
advantaged by the changes brought about by
industrialisation.Ayub Kahn also had to face the problems ofPakistan’s national security. Relations with India
went from bad to worse after independence.
Pakistan had taken advantage of the Cold War ten-

sions to redress the balance as against a larger and
stronger India by tying itself to the US-backedanti-communist line-up of nations in Asia, joiningthe South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO)
in 1954 and the Baghdad Pact the following 
year. As expected, Pakistan thereupon received
substantial American military and ﬁnancial aid.
For Pakistan and India, however, it was not theCold War that primarily concerned them but rela-
tions with each other. At the heart of their con-
ﬂict lay the problem of Kashmir. All attempts by
Pakistan to negotiate directly with India came tonothing; nor could the United Nations ﬁnd apeaceful way to mediate. Every attempt was
blocked by Nehru, who refused to hold the
plebiscite he had earlier promised. The possibility
that the majority of Kashmir’s people might optfor Pakistan because they were Muslims struck atthe heart of India’s nationhood as conceived by
Nehru and the other Congress leaders: India was
a secular state in which both Muslims and Hindus1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT631
should ﬁnd their rightful place. The secession of Muslim Kashmir might prompt demands byMuslims elsewhere in India for a plebiscite and,
ultimately, for the right of secession, thus under-
mining Indian unity. India was the stronger and
could afford to sit tight, in control of most ofKashmir. Inside Kashmir the Indians suppres-sed all opposition and stiﬂed a growing demand 
for independence. Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah,
Nehru’s friend, was arrested and imprisoned in
1953 for declaring that he found integration of
Kashmir into India an unacceptable solution. Hewas not released until 1964.Nehru’s India was treated with suspicion bythe US and the West. He followed a non-aligned
policy in the Cold War and was one of the archi-
tects of the non-aligned Bandung meeting in April1955. He also enjoyed the support of Khrushchevover Kashmir when the Soviet leader visited Delhi
in December 1955, and sought good relations
with communist China. China’s claim of sover-
eignty over Tibet caused India anxiety, but thiswas dispelled by the Indian–Chinese ‘peacefulcoexistence’ agreement in 1954. When the
Chinese army invaded Tibet to put down a revolt
in 1959 and the Dalai Lama ﬂed to India, rela-
tions between India and China deteriorated to
the point of armed conﬂict. To ensure better
control of Tibet, China had occupied an area ofKashmir, the Asai Chin, and had constructed a
road through it from China to Tibet. When China
next attacked the ill-deﬁned Chinese–Kashmir and
Indian frontier in October 1962, the Indian armywas woefully unprepared and was defeated. Nehruhad to ask for Western help, and since the oppo-
nent was now communist China received military
aid from the US, Britain and the Soviet Union.
In a show of strength China thereupon invaded
the frontier region of India but unilaterally with-drew after securing the frontier it wanted. A cease-ﬁre in December 1962 in effect settled the issue
in China’s favour. Pakistan did not take advan-
tage of India’s military plight.In need of Western aid, Nehru was now pres-surised by the West to reach a settlement overKashmir. The West was anxious to ensure peace
on Pakistan’s eastern Indian frontier so that it
could concentrate on its Western alliance againstcommunism. But Realpolitikdictated otherwise.In May 1964, Nehru died. Pakistan was now con-vinced that only by war would it prove possible
to resolve the Kashmir issue and the frontier dis-
putes with India. The rearrest of Sheikh Abdullab
by the Indians made the conﬂict more certain. InDecember 1964, India declared that Kashmir’saccession to ‘the Union was ﬁnal and irrevocable’,
a move that greatly angered Pakistan.Western policies dictated by Cold War consid-eration had been particularly uncertain on the
Indian subcontinent, veering from support forPakistan to supporting India after 1962 andarming both sides. The Soviet Union also sought
to play an inﬂuential role by supporting India
with arms and aid during Khrushchev’s ambitious
period of world politics. India, meanwhile, alwaysregarded Pakistan as its principal enemy. As theWest after 1962 massively increased the armed
forces of India, Pakistan normalised relations with
the Soviet Union and drew closer to China again.The poor performance of the Indian armyagainst the Chinese encouraged Pakistan tobelieve it could now capture Kashmir. At the end
of August 1965 Pakistani troops struck across the
UN ceaseﬁre line in Kashmir. On 6 September
the Indian army replied with an all-out war
against Pakistan. Two countries of the BritishCommonwealth were now at war with each other.Despite India’s military superiority, Pakistan
forces resisted effectively. For the second time the
Soviet Union and the US were agreed that a war
should be ended. Both were anxious to keepChina in check. The US did not help its ally,Pakistan, and the Soviet Union did not help its
‘ally’, India. After only seventeen days, on 23
September, ﬁghting ceased in accordance with a
Security Council resolution sponsored jointly 
by the US and the Soviet Union, with Britain’sfull support. Alexei Kosygin, the Soviet primeminister, achieved a diplomatic coup in bringing
Nehru’s successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, and
Pakistan’s president, Ayub Khan, to a peace con-
ference at Tashkent in January 1966. In effect,the Kashmir question was put on ice and Indiaand Pakistan agreed to withdraw their forces
behind the frontiers as they had existed before 
the outbreak of the war. So ended the short632TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
Pakistani–Indian war. It had achieved nothing butcasualties for both sides, but the Soviet Union’sposture in Asia as a peacemaker was enhanced.In one respect, Pakistan’s development appearedto contrast favourably with India’s: the growth ofits economy in the Ayub Khan military era.Political stability, even of the repressive kind, is
seen by investors as a positive factor. In both agri-
culture and industry Pakistan’s wealth and pro-
duction grew rapidly in the 1960s. The magic
formula was to encourage a capitalist, market-oriented economy and to loosen the bureaucraticregulations imposed in the 1950s. Ayub Khan was
following with seeming success the development
prescriptions of theoretical economists. One of
the consequences they anticipated during thephase of rapid development in what was a ThirdWorld country was the unrestrained urge for
profits among the owners of the few existing
large-scale enterprises. The resulting inequalities
of wealth were truly staggering. Just twenty-twofamilies owned the greater part of industry,banking and insurance – or, to be more precise,
two-thirds of industry, four-ﬁfths of banking and
almost the whole of insurance. Their wealth was
fabulous. The senior military and civil service
prospered as well, together with a small middleclass. In the countryside agriculture benefitedfrom what was called the ‘green revolution’, the
creation of new plant breeds bearing much
heavier crops. This necessitated shorter stems that
would not bend over when carrying more grain.Agricultural research was given high priority inIndia and Pakistan. A rapidly growing population
needed to be fed. The uneven rainfall, the mon-
soon period followed by drought for nine months
of the year, was the main problem on the Indian
subcontinent. The seeds that produced the new‘green revolution’ plants of rice, wheat, maize,sorghum and millet seeds were imported from the
Philippines, Taiwan and Mexico. Farmers had to
be taught better techniques of husbandry and the
correct use of fertilisers. In India, the government,with the assistance of the Ford Foundation, pro-moted an all-round programme. In Pakistan, edu-
cation and research were undertaken by the
universities. Mexico also assisted by training manyagricultural scientists. In Pakistan it was the farm-ers of the larger farms in the Punjab who beneﬁtedrather than the peasants and small farmers and
those in the east, in Bengal.The price paid for an economic developmentin Pakistan that made the well-to-do richer andthe poor poorer, despite the rapid growth as mea-sured nationally, was a heavy one. The low living
standards of industrial workers and of peasants fell
even further. Development was also lopsided
regionally – West Pakistan did much better than
the eastern half of the country. The tensions wereheightened until there was an explosion thatended in civil war and swept the military rulers
from power, if only for a time.In 1969 there were student demonstrations,labour strikes and massive unrest coupled withdemands for the restoration of parliamentary rule.Ayub Khan promised to hold elections; he had no
desire to rule the country any longer under some
form of military repression, which was the only
alternative. Unlike Zia, he was no ruthless dicta-tor. He handed over power to another general,Yahya Khan, who also honestly attempted to pre-
side over a transition to civilian rule with the army
in the background as a check on unbridled polit-
ical conﬂict, which might otherwise lead to chaos.
In December 1970 genuinely free elections wereheld. The results and the behaviour of the politi-cians led to civil conﬂict and the Pakistani–Indian
war twelve months later.The elections split the country politically intwo, corresponding to the geographical division.No major party gained a seat in both East andWest Pakistan. In East Pakistan the powerful
political grouping known as the Awami League,
still led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and on a plat-
form advocating wide-ranging autonomy and
only a loose federal linking with the West, carriedall before it, gaining 151 seats and losing onlytwo. In West Pakistan eleven parties competed,
and none reached double ﬁgures except Zulﬁkar
Ali Bhutto’s Pakistan’s People’s Party with 81
seats. Bhutto was a charismatic, populist leaderfrom a wealthy landowning family in the provinceof Sind. His power base in that province was a
somewhat opportunistic alignment of opposition
to the capitalist–military rule: socialists in Sind1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT633
and the Punjab, resentful urban workers, liberalreformers and feudal landlords in Sind looking formore favourable regional treatment supported the
PPP and turned it into a mass party.Sections of the army, discontented with theoutcome of the brief Pakistani–Indian war in1965, also backed Bhutto. The elections over, theNational Assembly should have met shortly after.
It did not. The Awami League would have been
the governing group in it and the president,
General Yahya Khan, ﬁrst wanted an assurance
that the League’s policy would not in effect createa two-nation state. In taking this step, he was rein-forced by the strident West Pakistani nationalism
of Bhutto. Talks between Mujibur, Yahya and
Bhutto failed, and Mujibur was arrested. Bhutto
and elements in the army sought by violent threatsto prevent the convening of the NationalAssembly; shortly before it was due to meet in
March 1971, Yahya postponed it indeﬁnitely.The scene was now set for the tragic eventsthat followed: the attempt by the army to subdueEast Pakistan by force. Bengal, suffering anothernatural catastrophe in cyclones and ﬂoods, had
felt neglected by the lack of effective Western
relief. Now its right to democratic representation
was being denied by West Pakistan. The result of
all these cumulative failures was war in EastPakistan. Ten million Hindu refugees floodedacross the frontier into India, prompting the
Indian army to intervene in East Pakistan, and
also to attack in Kashmir. It was all over in two
weeks. The Pakistani army in the East becameprisoners of war. India and Pakistan concluded apeace settlement at Simla in December 1971 and
the independent state of Bangladesh was born.Independence did not much help theBangladeshi people. Theirs is one of the poorest
countries in the world, its population exposed toperiodic cataclysms of cyclone and ﬂoods. Here,too, the army for most of its history has been the
controlling element in repressive government. In
1975 Mujibur was assassinated in an army coup.
Powerless parliamentary assemblies and armystrongmen have ruled this country, beset by hugeeconomic problems and a rapidly growing popu-
lation. General Ershad seized power in 1982,
retaining it until overthrown by a wave of popularprotest in 1990 which ended years of corruption,only to start a new period of turmoil. Meanwhile,in little more than a decade, the population had
grown from 84.6 million to over 110 million.In West Pakistan the lost war decided the armyto take a back seat, and Yahya transferred power toBhutto and his PPP. Would Bhutto now usher inthe long-delayed social and political reforms,
heralding a new era of parliamentary democratic
government? In this respect, the Bhutto years
from 1972 to 1977, that is until his own violent
overthrow by another army coup, were a disap-pointment. The 1973 constitution was indeedintended to transform Pakistan into a parliamen-
tary democracy; but only a year later it was
amended. Bhutto’s political corruption under-

mined the development of democratic politicalparties, as he likewise violently repressed politicalopponents. Civil liberties were severely limited
and in the provinces autonomy was crushed. His
socialist zeal soon ﬂagged after some early and
limited measures of nationalisation. Funds for thepromised free education and for the provision ofhealth care for the poor failed to materialise, leav-
ing unﬁlled the huge gap in the basic social ser-
vices. Economic growth slowed. But there were
some reforms which particularly beneﬁted the fac-
tory workers and urban poor – a revision of labourlaws and the raising of wages. Bhutto conse-quently continued to enjoy, even after his fall in
1977, the mass support of millions of Pakistanis,
who remembered him for caring for the poor.Crucial to his political survival were Bhutto’srelations with the army. He sought to appease themilitary by increasing defence expenditure. He
appointed as his loyal army chief of staff a young
ofﬁcer who had foiled an army coup in 1972.
Bhutto’s fatal error was to choose the wrong man
– the ambitious, clever and utterly ruthless Zia-ul-Haq. Zia waited for Bhutto to run into polit-ical crisis. This occurred after the elections of
March 1977, which Bhutto had so blatantly
rigged that the opposition parties would not
accept the results. Fearing military intervention toquell the ensuing turmoil, Bhutto agreed to theholding of new elections, but before they could
be held, on 5 July 1977, Zia staged his military
coup. He claimed that Pakistan was on the verge634TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
of civil war and that he would hold electionswithin ninety days, whereupon he would handpower back to the elected civilian government. It
was the ﬁrst of his many broken promises. To rid
himself of Bhutto, meanwhile, the fallen prime
minister was tried and then, despite worldwideprotest, hanged in 1979. After that, Zia madelittle pretence of ruling other than dictatorially.Zia’s excuse for exercising arbitrary power wasthe need to wage a moral crusade to create an
Islamic state. He devoted himself to arresting,
imprisoning and executing his political opponentsand army rivals. Martial law was declared, and theremnants of civil liberties and political parties
were destroyed. Yet this tyrant won the support
of the West. Once more the Cold War had dis-
torted Western perceptions of priorities. Thedecisive event was the Soviet Union’s invasion ofAfghanistan in December 1979. Pakistan became
the base from which the Afghan mujahideen were
supplied. Moreover, since the Soviet invasion was
interpreted as a threat to the oil-rich Persian Gulf,Pakistan once more was seen as a crucial militarybulwark of the West. An earlier US arms embargo
was reversed into massive US military and eco-
nomic aid.By 1983 it appeared to Zia expedient, both forinternal reasons and to improve his image in theWest, to incorporate some civilian ministers anda controlled electoral body into the governing
structure of the country. The assemblies so
elected were to be Islamic rather than parliamen-
tary, and were not to feature competing politicalparties. The National Assembly elected in 1985nevertheless showed signs that it saw its own cre-
ation as only the ﬁrst step in the transfer of power
from the military. There was a strong revival of
political activity. Miss Benazir Bhutto, the daugh-
ter of the prime minister hanged by Zia, wasallowed to return to Pakistan in 1986 andattracted large crowds at her rallies. The prime
minister and his government, appointed by Zia,
showed an unwelcome desire for real power. It
was no surprise when, in May 1988, the primeminister was dismissed and the Assembly was dis-solved. But a return to further authoritarian mil-
itary rule was avoided by an accident, the death
of Zia in a plane crash in August 1988. Thepromised new elections were held in Novemberand Miss Benazir Bhutto emerged as the winnerwith the PPP gaining the largest number of seats
of any party. It was a startling result for a Muslim
country – the ﬁrst woman prime minister.The West, especially the US administration,heaved a sigh of relief at being rid of the blemishof association with Zia. Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto promised to continue the pro-Western
Afghan policy of her predecessor but the lessening
of Soviet–US hostility as the Cold War came to an
end made the military establishment less import-ant in American eyes. Benazir Bhutto’s hold onpower was fragile, dependent on maintaining a
coalition partnership with an unreliable ethnic
party. The government could make little headway
in solving the country’s economic problems, ineasing regional tensions with the provinces or inimproving its international position. The Afghan
Civil War continued even after the departure of
Soviet troops in December 1989, and millions of
refugees remained across the border in Pakistan.With democracy restored, Pakistan was welcomedback into the Commonwealth, but the most seri-
ous problem – the perennial conﬂict over the
future of Kashmir – was brought no nearer to a
solution. In 1990 Benazir Bhutto was dismissed,
accused of leading a corrupt government. Afterfresh elections her fall from power was conﬁrmedby the voters. In the early 1990s the army contin-
ued to abide by its undertaking not to intervene.
Parliamentary democracy, however, remained a
fragile plant in Pakistan.In Pakistan, life and politics have shown littleimprovement in the 1990s. Since the end of 
the Cold War, and the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan, for the US Pakistan’s role as a key ally
had seemingly ended. The US became concerned
to foil its attempts to build nuclear weapons. Theprincipal 500 families continue to hold most ofthe land and inequality remains extreme. Violence
broke out in bitter clashes between militant sec-
ond-generation Muslim refugees from India, the
Mohajirs, and government forces. In the mid-1990s the Mohajirs sought to combat discrim-ination by forming their own political party; 
attempts to crush the violent protests led to more 
than 2,000 deaths, mainly in Karachi. Meanwhile, 1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT635
corruption and venal politics have led to govern-mental instability. In November 1996 the presi-dent dismissed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto;
ﬁnancial scandals had surrounded her husband
and Swiss bank accounts had been opened in her
name. Her brother was also engaged in violence;his murderers were never identiﬁed. Bhutto’s suc-cessor, Nawaz Sharif, promised cleaner govern-ment and a revival of the economy. However,
Pakistan’s long history of corrupt and violent

There was no outcry or support for thepoliticians.In 1999 Pakistan reverted for the fourth timeto military rule, overthrowing the civilian gov-
ernment. General Pervez Musharraf appointedhimself president. The army occupies a privelegedposition having infiltrated all branches of the
bureaucracy at state and provincial level. In the
West Musharraf was shunned. Pakistan’s assistance
to the Taliban and North Korea’s nuclear ambi-
tions especially aroused American anger. ButPakistan is a nuclear power and had to be treatedwith care. The deﬁning moment for Musharraf
was 11 September and the US determination to
fight al-Qaeda in its home base, Afghanistan.
Musharraf abruptly changed and threw in his lotwith the US risking Muslim outrage in the greaternational interest. Pressure on Musharraf to step
down ceased with equal suddeness now that he
had become an ally. This, in turn, encouraged
Musharraf to pursue his campaign in Kashmir.There had already been a serious crisis in thesummer of 1999, but in the winter of 2001 it
escalated to a confrontation that threatened to
ﬂare into war. The trigger was exchange of gunﬁre
and ﬁghting across the line of control in Kashmir,
the inﬁltration of guerrillas aided by Pakistan onthe Indian side and ﬁnally the attack by terror-ists on India’s parliament on 13 December while 
in session. India blamed Pakistan, the attackers
were killed but nine Indians lost their lives.In October 2002 Musharraf restored the sem-blance of civilian rule permitting a general elec-tion for the Assembly. A divided opposition
allowed Musharraf’s supporters to gain a narrow
win. But the most remarkable aspect was the rise
of the opposition Islamic religious parties. There
is strong opposition to Musharraf’s US friendlypolicy and anger at his abandonment of theTaliban. Musharraf remained firmly in control
holding the position both of president and chief
of the army. Kashmir remains the most important
goal making it difﬁcult for Musharraf to respondto Indian approaches. The Pakistan army contin-ued to support irregular units entering Indian-
controlled Kashmir where they committed
terrorist attacks.India’s democracy is embodied in its constitution,which, enacted by the Constituent Assembly inNovember 1949 came into force in January 1950.
In its form of government the Republic of India
leans heavily on British constitutional theory. The
president has a similar role to that of the sover-eign; the power of government is exercised by theprime minister, who chooses his Cabinet col-

leagues and is dependent on the majority support
of a political party competing regularly at general
elections. The Indian constitution departs from
its unwritten British model by incorporating a Billof Rights; another novel feature is the inclusionof ‘Directive Principles’ of state policy, intended
in a positive way to remedy particular Indian con-
ditions of exploitation and discrimination such as
exist in the caste system of untouchables. Indiawas proclaimed a secular state. Except for oneperiod of authoritarian rule under Indira Gandhi’s
Emergency (1975–7), democracy – with general
elections by adult suffrage, freedom of speech and
of the press, the toleration of non-violent polit-ical opposition, an independent judiciary andfreedom from arbitrary arrest – has prevailed since
independence. This reﬂects a harmonisation of
British tradition and post-independence Indian
political will. But, in practice, Indian democracy
is speciﬁc to India, and no mere copy of that inBritain or in the US.Political parties do not function as in mostWestern parliaments. The prime minister’s role
became pre-eminent not only in comparison with
the president’s, but – under Nehru – in relationto the Assembly as well. This was one conse-quence of Nehru’s complete dominance of
politics for the eighteen consecutive years he
served as prime minister. He was not even for-
mally chosen as their leader by the Congress
Party, but the mantle of Gandhi’s heir unques-tionably fell on his shoulders. He enjoyed supportthroughout the country and enjoyed touring and
addressing mass rallies. He carried the Congress
Party with him at every general election, in 1952,
1957 and 1962. In the Assembly, the Lok Sabha,Congress was by far the strongest party with neverless than 45 per cent of the total vote; the other
parties were fragmented and drew support only
from largely regional bases. So India looked like1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT637
becoming a one-party democracy. There are par-allels with Italy here. This had its effect on theCongress Party itself. It lacked any common ide-
ology or policies; it was just the ‘winning party’,
split into factions, with supporters of the right
and supporters of socialism. Various interestsbelieved themselves best protected by being onthe government side. This was hardly a healthy
basis for the development of a parliamentary
democracy.Power corrupts, or it nearly always does so.Nehru’s claim to statesmanship and greatness isthat power did not corrupt him. He had the meansto become authoritarian and follow the example
of other charismatic Third World leaders who,
once elected, became dictators, but he set himself
the task of making a success of the democraticexperiment in this huge country where the major-ity were poor or destitute and unable to read. 
He toured the country, educating the people to
use their precious right to exercise the vote. He
was prepared to listen, to discuss and debate with his ministerial colleagues and with the leaders ofthe Congress Party. Some were opposed to one 
or other of his policies, such as his insistence on a
secular state, his pragmatic socialism, his opposi-
tion to caste discrimination and his relations 
with the states of the Union. In his dealings withthose who opposed him, he was humorous,patient and tolerant. He distrusted theory, rigid
thinking and doctrinaire solutions. Consequently,
clear-cut and consistent policies were not a mark
of his years in ofﬁce.Nehru could irritate the West by preachingpeace; it accused him of hypocrisy, of underrat-
ing the menace of communism, and pointed to
inconsistencies in his tolerance and paciﬁsm, espe-
cially in his denial of self-determination to the
people of Kashmir and his readiness to use forceto defeat secessionist movements in the 1950sand 1960s. He was also ready to use force against
foreign nations. Portuguese Goa represented the
last vestige of European colonialism in India.
After long and fruitless negotiations Nehrumarched Indian troops into Goa in December1961 and the Portuguese surrendered.Nehru set himself a number of clear objectivesfor the future of India. With these he would notcompromise. The ﬁrst was to preserve the terri-torial unity of the state. The second was to ensurethe rights of all India’s inhabitants, whatever their
religion or ethnic cultural background. This
meant that India must be a secular democratic
country. The third was to raise standards of living,to develop India into a great modern state. Thefourth objective was to ensure Indian security.
This involved freeing India from economic
dependence on other countries. It would also
need a powerful army, but that army would be
subject to civilian control. Nehru’s aims help toexplain his apparent inconsistencies. His handlingof Kashmir was one of these. To allow religion to
decide allegiance could plunge India into chaos.
For similar reasons he also sent the Indian army
to suppress the independence movements of thetribal peoples in the extreme north-east of India.With the hundreds of princes and their states,Nehru had less trouble, apart from Kashmir and
Jammu. He left it to his able lieutenant, Sardar
Patel, to negotiate the abandonment of theirrights and the integration of their states in returnfor pensions. The princes, large and small, were
in a hopeless position confronted with the Indian
army. The Muslim Nizam of Hyderabad never-
theless postponed a decision: his people were
Hindu and his large territory was entirely sur-rounded by India, but he was not left a freechoice whether to accede to Pakistan or to India
– in fact, he dreamt of independence. An Indian
army police action in September 1948 put an end
to his prevarication and the integration processwas completed in 1950, the year in which Patel,India’s most able political leader after Nehru,
died. There was no room for the princes in
modern India.Nehru showed more forbearance when con-fronted by another problem that threatened tofragment India. This was the vexed question ofthe ‘ofﬁcial’ language to be spoken by all Indians.
English was the only common language, but it
was conﬁned to a tiny percentage of the educated.
Of the more than thirty major languages, the lan-guage of northern India, Hindi, was spoken bythe largest single group but not by a majority of
all Indians; large minorities of between 20 and 45
million (in 1971) spoke Urdu, Telugu, Bengali,638TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati and so on – some four-teen major languages. Urdu is the language of thelargest minority, the Muslims: in its spoken form
it is Hindi, but it uses a different script. Because
it involved the Muslim minority it was therefore
especially important to Nehru to ﬁnd an accept-able solution. The sensitivity of the language issueis that it can move beyond ethnic and cultural
identity to assertions of national independence.
Nehru wisely compromised, allowing many lan-
guages to coexist with English and Hindi and
postponing the introduction of Hindi as thenational language for ﬁfteen years – whereupon itwas postponed again. Nehru’s readiness to envis-
age a multicultural India took the heat out of the
divisive language issue. But when language was
being used as part of an independence claim, asin the extreme north-east of India, Nehru usedforce to suppress such movements.Nehru laid down the fundamental principlethat religion and politics should be separated and
that India was a secular state, all of whose citizens,of whatever religion, enjoyed equal civil rights.This necessarily represented a step away from the
spirituality that lay at the heart of Gandhi’s
mission. Muslims, who constitute about 11 per
cent of India’s population, had traditionally been
supporters of the Congress and continued to beelected to the Assembly and to serve in India’sgovernments. Nehru and his successors worked
hard to remove any discrimination against the
Muslims, but the improving Muslim–Hindi rela-
tionship was threatened in the second half of the1980s by the rise of a group of Hindu funda-mentalists. They began to stir up religious ani-
mosities by attempting to reclaim former Hindu
sites on which mosques now stood. So some
fanatical Hindi groups were acting against a tra-
dition renowned for its tolerance towards otherreligions.Nehru was the privileged son of a wealthyfamily. He nevertheless regarded democratic,
humane socialism not only as the best means to
secure Indian economic development, but also asthe best weapon to break down the evil of India’sdiscriminatory class and caste society. Before and
after independence, he linked socialism in India,
which he believed would free its peasant andurban poor from dependence and indignity, toliberating the oppressed in Asia and Africa fromthe dependence imposed by Western imperialism.
He was optimistic that reason, law and democ-
racy would overcome tradition and prejudice. His
was a noble vision that diverged signiﬁcantly fromreality both in his lifetime and after. But hisdemocracy of the poor did not deliver the results
he hoped for. The democratic structure became
distorted by the power and inﬂuence of family
connection and of caste, by the landowning 
class and the wealthy elite. A huge conservativebureaucracy clogs and frustrates fair and efﬁcientgovernment. India did not make the progress
Nehru expected by adopting scientiﬁc socialism
and Western liberal values, but that does not
mean that the fundamental principles of his policywere wrong. Indians, in developing their country,did not suffer the harsh fate that befell millions
of Stalin’s subjects and Mao Zedong’s peasants.India’s economic development from independ-ence to the 1990s only just kept ahead of its pop-ulation growth. In successive five-year plansNehru accepted the premise of the Soviet experi-
ence, that to come of age as an independent state
India would need to give priority to becoming a
modern industrial and military power, with its
own heavy industries. The public sector wouldenter into contracts with the key industries, andcentral planners would control the commanding
heights of the economy. As in Britain, commu-
nism and doctrinaire socialism were rejected in
favour of a mixed economy. Not until the 1980sdid the emphasis revert back to greater reliance onthe private sector. Despite the establishment of a
modern industrial core – steel, oil, chemicals,
power and transport – India’s economic develop-
ment mainly beneﬁted a growing urban middle
class, which demanded all the consumer luxuriesof the West. That development left behind theurban poor and the destitute, living in shacks and
on pavements in the cities – cities which, in this
respect, resembled the Third World urban sprawls,
with their contrasts between rich and poor.The increase in agricultural production wasalso disappointing compared with that attained by
other Asian countries, such as South Korea. The
‘green revolution’, which achieved a tripling of1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT639
cereal production in India, proved far less suc-cessful in raising the output of its staple food, rice.Again, agricultural production kept only narrowly
ahead of population growth. The emphasis on
industrial development delayed the investment
necessary to accelerate the growth of farming. Byworld standards, Indian yields were low, thoughthat at least left scope for spectacular improve-
ment. But such improvements would not occur
without social change and without greater
resources being devoted to the education of
India’s numerous peasantry. The states of Indiawhose inﬂuence predominated on questions ofland reform were controlled by the very landown-
ers who had little interest in bringing it about.
Consequently, reforms such as land distribution
to the landless or to those peasants without viableholdings were not implemented to any greatextent. Mass poverty persisted in India in the
1990s.Nehru died in 1964. His death left a politicalvacuum. Would so flawed a party democracysurvive after so many years of stability under
Nehru’s leadership? The Congress leaders had to
choose between the pro-Western conservative
Morarji Desai, a former finance minister, Lal
Bahadur Shastri, an elderly follower of Gandhi,or, on the left, Nehru’s daughter, Mrs IndiraGandhi. Their choice fell on Shastri. He held the
premiership only brieﬂy, incongruously a period
notable for the war with Pakistan, before dying
suddenly in 1966 while at Tashkent seeking tomake peace. Indira Gandhi succeeded to the pre-miership. In the Congress Party, Mrs Gandhi
defeated her rival Morarji Desai and went on to
win the elections of 1967; the reverence accorded
to her father was an enormous asset, though the
Congress Party lost seats. But Mrs Gandhi’sopponents in the Congress Party, especially theparty bosses in the states, had not given up the
struggle against her. In 1969 the party split.
Indira Gandhi was expelled but carried the major-
ity of the party in the Assembly with her, whichbecame known eventually as the Congress (I)Party. She called another general election in
March 1971 and completely defeated her oppo-
nents in the rival Congress Party. Her interven-tion in Bengal when civil war broke out inPakistan in 1971, the ensuing defeat of Pakistanby India and the creation of Bangladesh made her
a popular national leader and enabled her to win
state elections too in 1972.Indira Gandhi, lacking the moderation andrestraint of her father, established a strong, cen-tralised and personal style of ruling. She sought
to dominate state politics completely by appoint-
ing her own nominees to the chief posts. Was her
motive personal power alone? The old bosses had
certainly blocked all radical land reform andIndira Gandhi tried to help the peasants. But hernew policies promoting the ‘green revolution’
and the anti-poverty programmes had only
limited success. She soon ran into trouble. There
were food shortages, outbreaks of violence insome states and countrywide protests, until acourt ruling in June 1975 declared her 1971 elec-
tion to be invalid owing to irregularities. She was
ordered to be suspended from holding ofﬁce, but
she put a sudden end to opposition moves to dis-credit her by requesting the president to declarean emergency.Indira Gandhi now put in question her father’swork and the future of Indian democracy as civil
rights were suspended, press censorship imposed,
thousands of opponents imprisoned and the elec-
tions due in 1976 postponed. Particularly resentedwas her arrogant son Sanjay, not least for his laud-

able but insensitive campaign to limit population
growth by persuading peasants in the villages to
submit to sterilisation. Disaffection against the var-
ious arbitrary measures of the government grew.Mrs Gandhi, out of touch with the true feelingsof the country, called an election in December
1977 and was defeated by a coalition of opposi-
tion parties known as Janata. In a perverse way,
she had now produced a functioning democracywith the ﬁrst defeat of the governing party. ButJanata was simply a coalition of convenience to
oust Mrs Gandhi. Led by the venerable Morarji
Desai it restored normal government but in 1979
fell apart, allowing Mrs Gandhi to return to powerafter the general election of January 1980.She relied increasingly on her son Sanjay, untilhis death in an accident, as well as on other
members of her family and loyal retainers. She640TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
retained power because the opposition was toodivided to defeat her.The most notable crisis of Indira Gandhi’s ruleoccurred in the Punjab. Here, the Sikhs had
organised their own political party, the Akali Dal.
Even after partition religious and communalantagonisms in the Punjab were a cause of con-ﬂict between Hindu and Sikh. Although Sikhs in
the Indian army have been conspicuously loyal, in
the 1980s extremist groups demanded the cre-
ation of an independent Sikh state, Khalistan.
Moreover, a religious fanaticism was growingamong the Sikhs in the 1980s. Indira Gandhimade matters worse by attempting to play off the
more moderate Sikhs against the terrorists in her
efforts to secure central domination over the
state. In the end, in 1984, the killing of innocentHindus forced her to crack down on the extrem-ists, who withdrew with their armed bands to a
Sikh holy place, the Golden Temple in Amritsar.
In June she ordered the assault of the Golden
Temple and, with the loss of hundreds of lives, itwas bloodily cleared. The assault provokedoutrage among the Sikh community and cost
Indira Gandhi her life: two of her Sikh body-
guards assassinated her in November 1984. A
wave of violence and murders followed, directed
against innocent Sikhs in Delhi and other Indiancities. It was all a far cry from the days of Nehru,who had sought to conciliate and to reduce com-
munal strife and bloodshed.On a wave of sympathy and Hindu solidarity,Rajiv Gandhi succeeded his mother to the pre-miership and won a landslide victory in the general election held in December 1984. But his
government found no solution to India’s peren-
nial problems, prominent among them ethnic–
nationalist stirrings in some of India’s troubled
states. Terrorist attacks in the Punjab eventuallycaused hundreds of deaths and brought about the imposition of emergency rule. And, despite
meeting Benazir Bhutto, Rajiv Gandhi was unable
to bridge the gap between Pakistan and India 
over the Kashmir dispute. His boldest move, toassist the Sri Lankan government to suppress the Tamil Tigers by sending an Indian army to 
the island in 1987, ended in failure when his
forces withdrew in the summer of 1989. Sri Lankacontinues to be torn by civil war. Rajiv Gandhiand his ministers were accused of corruption, ofaccepting bribes when concluding a 1986 agree-
ment with the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors.
His Congress (I) Party, meanwhile, was as heavily
divided as ever, so it came as no surprise when it decisively lost the general election held inNovember 1989.A coalition of opposition parties assumedcontrol of the government under Prime Minister
Vishwanath Pratap Singh. Central and state gov-
ernment relations dominated the new govern-
ment. Kashmir erupted in what was more or lessrebellion and in 1990 suffered ﬁerce and bloody
repression from the Indian army occupying it.
This increased tension between Pakistan and
India, now both capable of ﬁghting with nuclearweapons. In the south, the government hascracked down on India’s Tamil state, which was
aiding the Tamils in Sri Lanka. At home Pratap
Singh’s efforts to assist the lower Hindu castes
through positive discrimination in governmentjobs led to violent protests in 1990 by the better-educated, higher-caste Indians, and young men
set ﬁre to themselves. Singh’s uneasy and feuding
coalition partners in government could not
provide the consistent and stable development
policies India desperately needed.Since the assassination of Rajiv Ghandi, India’sparty divisions have made it difﬁcult to create
governments based on stable parliamentary ma-
jorities. The emergence of the Hindu-nationalistBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has even threatenedthe cohesion of the state. Ambitious Hindu
leaders inﬂamed religious passions condemning
concessions to minority Muslims as a means to
power in an attempt to replace the Congress (I)
Party as the largest party in parliament. They succeeded only too well in 1992 in stirring upsectarian feeling. The flashpoint occurred in
December 1992 when a fanatical mob of tens of
thousands of Hindus tore down the sixteenth-
century Muslim mosque at Ayodhya. Militant BJPleaders accused the Muslims of having desecratedan earlier temple on the site dedicated to the
Hindu god Ram. The riots between Hindus and
Muslims, and the bloodshed that followed, were1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT641
reminiscent of confrontations of earlier years.Had civilised India made no progress? EvenBombay, where Muslims and Hindus were
devoted to making money and had lived together
for decades, erupted in violence in early 1993
with bombs and riots leaving hundreds dead. Yetquietly India’s 72-year-old prime minister,appointed in June 1991 as a ‘stop gap’, with the
able support of the ﬁnance minister Manmohan
Singh, set in motion a programme of reform, low-
ering taxes, and liberalising trade that has led to
foreign investment and lower inﬂation. The BJP’sinﬂuence has weakened and prospects for stabil-ity and development in 1994 began to look
better. Nevertheless, violence has a way of erupt-
ing unpredictably in India.The population of democratic India, at some860 million in the mid-1990s, was more thandouble what it had been on Independence Day
1947. By 1947 China had overtaken India in pro-
duction per head of population and India’s inabil-
ity to impose measures to control its populationhad a negative impact on economic growth.Another striking difference is China’s much
higher literacy rate. The Indian poor, on the
other hand, never had to suffer human catastro-
phes on the scale of Mao’s ‘mistakes’, which led
to famines in which at least 20 million died. Norhas India set up penal labour camps; freedom andthe rule of law are respected there.India’s ethnic, communal and religious divi-sions have made it difﬁcult to implement national
policies. This was compounded by political insta-bility and the corruption of leading politicians.Until the elections of May 1996 the Congress
Party had been the dominant ruling party for 
all but four years since Indian independence.
Recently governments have been made up ofunstable coalitions of twelve or more left-wingand regional parties, brought together only by thedesire to prevent the largest political party, the
militant Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), from
gaining power. There was one glimmer of hope
in India’s turbulent power struggles when an‘untouchable’, K. R. Narayanan, was elected pres-ident.India still suffers from the socialist economicpolicies adopted by Nehru; the successive ﬁve-year
state planning took its model from the Soviet
Union. Nehru’s aim was to turn India into a greatindustrial power, but the elephantine bureaucracy,the difﬁculties in securing planning permission
and the endemic corruption stifled enterprise.
High tariffs also interfered with market forces.
During the 1960s and 1970s Nehru’s daughter,Indira Gandhi, pursued such policies even morerigidly, while population growth left more than 
a third of the country below the poverty line.
Liberalisation of trade began in the 1980s but
made slow progress. India has remained saddledwith inefﬁcient state-owned industries; plans toprivatise minority interests in the most efﬁcient
were only at the planning stage at the end of the
1990s. With its large middle class and even larger
proportion of desperately poor people, the gap
between rich and poor is as wide here as anywherein the developing world. The need for change andreform and for a tough line on corruption has
been recognised, but implementation is proving a
painfully slow process.Kashmir continued to be the most serious issuein India’s foreign relations. The province was fullyintegrated into India; its predominantly Muslim
population remains an issue capable of quickly
ﬂaring into a crisis between India and Pakistan. A
large Indian army is in occupation but low-level642TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949

fighting continues; greater autonomy for theregion may provide an eventual solution.A sea change of politics occurred in the springof 1998. The decline of the Congress Party since
the late 1980s and the growth of regional state
parties allowed the Hindu nationalist BJP tobecome the largest single party in the Delhi legis-lature after the election was held, though well
short of a majority. The BJP had moderated its
tone to broaden its appeal and make possible the
formation of a coalition of smaller parties which
had, up to then, shunned the party associated withHindu extremism. The BJP’s ideology to turn secular India, the cornerstone of Ghandi’s and
Nehru’s legacy, into a religious state was threat-
ened, 120 million Muslims fearing the danger of
new religious conflicts. In Delhi, the BJP-ledcoalition was headed, since March 1998, by PrimeMinister Atal Behari Vajpayee, whose tone was
moderate. But control can be wrested out ofDelhi’s hands in the states. The worst atrocityoccurred in the BJP-controlled state of Gujaratwhose chief minister Nasendra Modi allowed a
pogrom to take place, killing thousands of
Muslims and driving 100,000 from their homes.The rise of militants in the BJP threatens theposition of Vajpayee who, already in his seventies,cannot continue in power for long. The deep-
rooted religious conﬂict, the struggle for India to
remain a secular country, mars India’s progress in
the new millennium. Its economy since the 1990s
has grown around ﬁve per cent, respectable in dif-ficult global conditions, benefiting the middleclasses, but without a much higher rate of growth
India’s masses are trapped in poverty and, in
2002, the BJP went slow on the highly necessary
programme of economic privatisation to avoidoffending electors. Foreign confidence in theIndian economy declined. The BJP were also
unexpectedly on the verge of losing power.1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT643
The impact of the American occupation years onJapan was momentous. The victor was admired
and America’s national sport, baseball, and
clothes and manners were widely copied, espe-cially by the young. The occupiers found it hardto believe that this was the enemy that only
recently had fought so ﬁercely and cruelly. To all
outward appearances Japan was adapting quickly
to a new image of ‘Made in America’. A brand
new constitution in 1947 introduced ‘democracy’and was based on the ﬁnest ideals of the West, amixture of Jefferson and Montesquieu. It pro-
vided for a parliament with an upper and a lower
house elected by universal suffrage, political
parties, a prime minister and Cabinet dependenton a majority in the lower house, and an inde-pendent judiciary. The emperor became a mortal,
a national symbol rather than a divinity. The
changes were for real, but this Western model of
democratic institutions had a very traditional
Japanese orientation. Western and Japanese atti-tudes fused to create something different fromthe constitutional governments of the West but
also from the autocratic military-dominated
regime of pre-war Nippon.The traditions survived of a hierarchical societythat placed great emphasis on personal relationsbetween the leader and the led, each knowing his
place. Japanese society tends to be organised in
groups, each with its own charismatic leader – the
‘parent’ groups begetting ‘child’ groups, thusbuilding up powerful ‘families’. Policies aredecided by the manoeuvres of the leading groups.Group thought prevails. Democracy, with its
emphasis on the individual, does not sit very easily
with such an ethos. Another weakness of Japanesedemocracy was that one party dominated Japan-ese politics for nearly half a century after the
Second World War; patronage and corruption
became so widespread, they were practically insti-
tutionalised.An important feature of Japanese governmentis the role of the bureaucracy, of the leading per-sonalities who guide the ministries and work in
close association with business. They are not civil
servants in the Western sense, simply carrying out
the instructions of politicians, their electedmasters; rather, Japanese mandarins built up anindependent network, providing constant guid-
ance and exchange of information with the busi-
ness elites. This role is not laid down in the
constitution, but conforms to Japanese traditions.
The prime minister and ministers rely on thebureaucracy not only for carrying out policies butfrequently for initiating them. So the bureaucrats
are in practice legislators themselves, and the pro-
ceedings of the Diet, or Assembly, no more than
a formality. In relations with the citizen they alsoprovide gyosei shido, or ‘administrative guidance’,which does not have the character of legislation,
and they enjoy a close relationship with members
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. It takes
prime ministers of exceptional strength and abilityto impose their wills on the bureaucracy, and ofChapter 59THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I
JAPAN, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, SINGAPORE
AND SOUTH KOREAthese there have been relatively few. The careersof bureaucrat and politician were not mutuallyexclusive, and it helps to understand their close
relationship when the careers of ministers be-
tween 1955 and 1980 are examined. Former
bureaucrats held the ofﬁce of prime minister forno less than twenty out of these twenty-ﬁve years.In dealings with business elites and with ﬁ-nancial policy the bureaucrats of a number of
ﬁnancial institutions have played a leading role,
pre-eminent among them the Japan Development
Bank and the Export–Import Bank, working withthe Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Inter-national Trade and Industry (MITI). Numerous
other agencies play a part, including the Science
and Technology Agency. Rivalry between these
institutions is endemic, which makes coordinationdifﬁcult. Japanese government is not therefore, as it is frequently believed to be, an efﬁcient, well-
oiled machine. Errors are made – for example, the
neglect until recently of the environmental con-
sequences of industrial growth – and it can takea long time before decisions are reached. Despitethese drawbacks, the Japanese political, bureau-
cratic and business elites for four decades since
the war contained enough men of outstanding
vision and ability to propel Japan’s phenomenal
economic growth.During these early years Japan’s unique busi-
ness organisation served Japan well. The Federa-

tion of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) was
founded in 1946 at the nadir of Japan’s industrial
fortunes and rapidly developed wide national andinternational interests, maintaining close contactswith bureaucrats and the ruling party. The Japan
Federation of Employers deals with employer–
employee relations, when necessary taking a 
leading role in ﬁghting labour demands. Another

inﬂuential body, which is independent but worksclosely with the bureaucracy, is the Japan Chamberof Commerce and Industry. All these trade organ-

isations publicise their views on national policy and
exert great inﬂuence on the political process. This
is not unconnected with the huge ﬁnancial contri-
butions that they make to the Liberal DemocraticParty, to groups and even to individuals within the
party. The other smaller, non-communist parties
have beneﬁted to a lesser degree from businesscontributions. Nor are bureaucrats immune frommore subtle forms of business ‘patronage’. What
businessmen want from government is to be ableto conduct their operations as proﬁtably as possible
at home and abroad with the minimum of interfer-

ence – in other words, capitalist enterprise with
government providing incentives, information, tax
breaks and so on, restricting imports and leavingthe door open for exports. Government, in otherwords, is required to create an environment in

During the ﬁrst decade after the war, a numberof parties competed for power, most of them con-
servative, though there were also socialist andcommunist parties. The socialists, in coalitionwith conservatives, actually held power for a few
months in 1947 and 1948. The threat that, with
a more united left, the Japanese Socialist Party
might return to power overcame the differencesamong the various conservative parties and drovethem to form in November 1955 the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP). But the left split again,
and from 1955 to 1990 was unable to mount an
effective challenge or to offer a credible alterna-
tive administration to the LDP. This enabled theLDP to form the government on its own or withminor allies following the twelve elections held
between 1958 and 1990. Only twice, in 1976 and
1979, did the LDP fail to win an absolute major-
ity in the House of Representatives and then onlyjust; the opposition was far too split to form an1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I645

more than 166 out of 467 seats (1958) and con-
tinued to grow weaker in the 1980s despite a
temporary upsurge in 1989. For more than threedecades the LDP was the ‘eternal’ ruling party.Nonetheless, there was plenty of politicalinﬁghting within the umbrella Liberal Democratic
Party. The various groups within the party all
follow their own leader, whose views they then
unanimously back. Membership of a group is amatter not of political attitude but of personalattachment and loyalty. The ‘boss’ determines the
power of the group or faction, which rises or falls
or splits according to its success in inﬂuencing the
overall leadership. Thus strongmen dominate theparty, and bargains and alliances are struckbetween the six or seven most powerful groups.
Cabinet posts, ministerial portfolios and party
executive positions comprise the patronage that
the president of the party is able to bestow oncehe has obtained the support of enough factionsto take over the leadership. The ‘leadership fac-
tions’, having backed the right horse, enjoy
enhanced power; the ‘non-leadership factions’
now work for change so that they can be on the
winning side next time. So ‘democracy’ worksafter a fashion, not between parties but within theLiberal Democratic Party. The emphasis is less on
policies than on the power struggles among the
factions. The president of the party automatically
becomes the prime minister of the country. Thatwas how all the prime ministers of Japan werechosen from the 1950s on.The Japanese in-groups in politics, businessand the bureaucracy know the rules and know
how to play by them so as to make their inﬂu-
ence felt. As individuals they have to conform tothe wishes of the leadership of their particularinterest group. From the interplay between these
groups, consensus policies eventually emerge. But
what about the sizeable minority who are not part
of the in-group – the politicians of the left, themore militant trade unionists, citizens who do notshare the views of the Liberal Democratic Party?
What about the generation gap, those young
people who rebel against the elders’ practice oftrying to determine every facet of their later life?And what about the small band of traditionalistsor nationalists who reject imported American
culture and Western-style politics? There is no
safety valve for their views. They are condemned
to be permanent outsiders, and their lack of inﬂu-ence through the established channels leads topent-up frustrations which periodically explode
into violence – as happened at the massive
demonstrations against the ratification of the
US–Japanese Mutual Security Treaty in April and
May 1960.Just as it did in the West, student protestboiled over in 1968 and 1969 in Tokyo, over the
need for university reform. In 1968 large-scale
demonstrations demanded the return of Okinawa,
the US-occupied island in the Paciﬁc, and clam-oured for the removal of American bases. Therewere also street battles between police and stu-
dents over the government’s decision to build
another international airport outside Tokyo on
farmland. The clashes continued into the 1970s.This was ‘direct democracy’, given that other con-stitutional means of voicing dissent were blocked.
But protest was never strong enough seriously to
imperil the Japanese way of government or of
conducting business. Economic progress and the
promise of material benefit encouraged themajority of the people to compete for the bestopportunities and to conform.The dominant political leader during the occu-pation years and immediately after was Shigeru
Yoshida, who was out of sympathy with GeneralMacArthur’s liberal and democratic views. Hewelcomed the ‘reverse course’ which was adopted
as soon as Washington became primarily con-

cerned with the containment of communism.
Yoshida headed the government ﬁve times from
May 1946 to May 1947 and then from October1948 to December 1954. A former career diplo-mat, he became prime minister only because
Ichiro Hatoyama, who was president of the
Liberal Party, had chosen him as his successor.
Hatoyama had had to leave politics for a timebecause he was unacceptable to the Americans:like many early leaders, including Yoshida, he had
shared the ideology of Japan’s ‘co-prosperity
sphere’ in Asia before 1945. Yoshida rehabilitated646TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
himself in the eyes of the Americans by coura-geously pressing for peace when the war was allbut lost; moreover, he blamed the military for
their adventurist readiness to go to war with the
West in 1941. In 1946 he recognised that Japan’s
recovery depended on being trusted again by theUS. This meant winning over MacArthur andaccepting the directives of his headquarters,
SCAP, when they could not safely be circum-
vented. He thus played a similar role to Adenauer
in West Germany. The escalation of the Cold War
in Asia, Washington’s loss of China as an ally andthe outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 hastenedJapan’s rehabilitation.Yoshida exploited with great skill theAmerican–Communist confrontation. MacArthur
had long been persuaded that his prescriptionshad turned Japan into a democracy. In June 1950Secretary of State John Foster Dulles came to
Japan, to win the Japanese as allies in Asia. He
wanted the famous Article 9 of MacArthur’s con-
stitution to be set aside so that Japan could rearm.Yoshida rejected rearmament, stressing all thenegative results it would have on the Japanese and
on Japan’s neighbours. Dulles was ‘flabber-
gasted’, but MacArthur sided with Yoshida. Japan
should build up its industrial potential and in that
way help the free world. Soon after the outbreakof the war in Korea, American orders for armscame pouring in and gave the Japanese economy
a much needed boost.Eventually the Japanese, under American pres-sure, did create a Self-Defence Force, initially ofonly 75,000 men. It expanded to 165,000 by1954 and 250,000 by 1980. The army, navy and
air force came to be equipped with the most
modern weapons, but in relation to Japan’s size
and wealth it was a small force. The Japanese
expended no more than 1.3 per cent of theirGNP on the military. The ‘saving’ as against theexpenditures of the Cold War countries was enor-
mous and was available for investment in indus-
try. But the Japanese elite was less niggardly in
building up a powerful paramilitary police forceof 250,000 to guarantee internal order.The negotiations leading to the peace treatyand the end of the American occupation were
long and arduous. Yoshida made as few conces-sions as possible. Japan would not rearm heavily;it would not itself participate in international dis-putes; it would rely on the US and its nuclear
umbrella for security. Japan would be the reliable
but passive ally of the US, which it would provide
with bases, and it undertook to grant no bases toother countries without American consent. TheAmericans retained Okinawa for military use only,
and the Japanese had to give up all the conquests
they had made since 1895. Yoshida also had to
concede that, if requested by the Japanese gov-
ernment, the US would provide assistance ‘to putdown large-scale internal riots and disturbances inJapan’. American rights inside Japan certainly
reminded the Japanese of the special rights that
foreigners had enjoyed in Japan until their aboli-
tion at the close of the nineteenth century. It washumiliating. Nevertheless these terms, embodiedin the US–Japanese Security Treaty, were signed
in San Francisco on the same day, 8 September
1951, as the Treaty of Peace with the Allied
powers. Australia and New Zealand were reluc-tant signatories, since they feared a Japanese mil-itary revival, but they were reassured by a
defensive treaty, ANZUS, with the US; the
US–Paciﬁc alliance structure was completed by
US treaties with the Philippines (1951), with
South Korea (1952) and with Taiwan (1954),and by SEATO (1954). Thus Japan was tied tothe anti-communist containment policy of the US
and thereby limited in its ability to adopt an inde-
pendent foreign policy.Japan had to follow the US lead in recognis-ing Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan as representingChina, and it was thus prevented from normalis-
ing its relationship with the People’s Republic.
Not surprisingly the Soviet Union refused to sign
any peace treaty with Japan, and a Japanese–
Soviet agreement formally ending hostilities wasnot reached until 1986 and territorial disputesstill stood in the way of a deﬁnitive peace treaty.The US–Japanese Mutual Security Treaty of1951 became a burning issue in Japanese politics.
The possibility that there might be nuclearweapons on US warships became a particularproblem; the left identiﬁed this treaty as a form
of US hegemony, which also keeps the conser-
vatives in power. Public hostility to the treaty1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I647
proved so strong, with widespread demonstra-
tions against it, that Washington agreed to reviseit in 1960. The changes were cosmetic, though
they allowed Japan a more equal voice; the
Japanese stressed their country’s residual sover-
eignty in the islands still militarily occupied by theUS. The revised treaty then came up for ratiﬁca-tion by the Diet. In April and May 1960 there
were unprecedented demonstrations and street
battles between the police and students and other
demonstrators. After unseemly scenes in the Diet
itself, the Liberal Democratic Party forced ratiﬁ-cation through. President Eisenhower was soincensed by these strong anti-American feelings
that he called off an intended visit to Japan.In 1970 the treaty was renewed again indeﬁ-nitely, subject to either country giving a year’snotice to terminate it. The following year aproblem was solved that closely touched Japanese
pride. The Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa,
were returned to the Japanese in the spring of
1972, though US bases were allowed to remainby agreement. But the territorial claim to fourislands of the southernmost part of the Kuril
island chain, occupied by the Russians, continued
to prevent good relations with the Russian 
republic. Thus after 1951 the American alliance,
despite all the difﬁculties it caused in internalJapanese politics, remained the sheet anchor ofJapan’s international position and defence.It was Yoshida who had set Japan on thatcourse. The close relationship with the US has
enabled Japan to eschew extensive military preten-sions, which could be seen as a threat to its Asianneighbours and endanger political stability at
home; but the relationship is also based on a
recognition that the US is indispensable to
Japanese prosperity, mainly by providing the enor-
mous single market on which that prosperity isbased. The Japanese have on a few occasions fol-lowed a more independent line from Washington
when their interests seemed to demand it. The
most notable instance has been in Japanese deal-
ings with the Arab oil states in the Middle East.After suffering from the effects of the Arab oilembargo in 1973, Japan made it clear to the Arab
states that it did not share Washington’s views on
Arab–Israeli issues and, indeed, supported theArab cause. In this way it bought the goodwill ofthe Arab states, who continued the oil supply vitalto Japanese industry. During the Iran–Iraq war in
the 1980s the Japanese attempted to stay on good
terms with both sides, despite America’s estrange-
ment from Iran, especially following the seizure ofthe American Embassy hostages. In 1990–1 dur-ing the Gulf crisis, Japan again displayed no
enthusiasm for the US position. The Americans
have at times shown little sensitivity for Japanese
feelings; Nixon’s sudden opening to China and
the dropping of the Nationalists in Taiwan in the1970s were undertaken without consulting Japan,which had faithfully followed the Washington line
in refusing to recognise communist China. But
despite strains, especially in matters of Japanese–
US trade, the alliance has held and what laterbecame known as the ‘Yoshida Doctrine’ contin-ued to chart the course of Japanese policy, with
only minor modiﬁcations.What then was the essence of that doctrine?Yoshida believed he would satisfy America’sdemands on Japan as an ally by offering facilitiesand bases and by restricting Japan’s own military
build-up. The Japanese forces were to be purely
defensive, forbidden to act except in defence of
the home islands, and Japan should forswear
development of nuclear weapons. In internationaldisputes its profile should be low. Japan hadfinally turned its back on achieving greatness
through military conquest; all its energies were to
be concentrated on economic rehabilitation and
growth. For its own security, Japan had no choicebut to rely on its American ‘ally’, which was alsoJapan’s most important trading partner. The
Yoshida strategy for Japan’s recovery was
accepted by the Liberal Democratic Party con-
sensus as the basis for Japan’s national policy and
long outlived Yoshida’s relinquishment of thepremiership in 1954. The doctrine was elaboratedand put into practice by Yoshida’s disciples and
protégés, for example Hayato Ikeda, who became
prime minister 1960–4, and Eisaku Sato, prime
minister 1964–72, and on into the 1970s and1980s. Yoshida’s vision helped to make Japaninto an industrial and financial superpower,
second only to the US, during the second half of
the twentieth century.648TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
The inner workings of a society are oftenobscured by outward appearances. This is cer-tainly true of Japan. Its early industrial successes
and its recovery from the low of war’s end might
at ﬁrst sight be ascribed to purposeful govern-
ments setting planned targets and, with the helpof the bureaucrats in the relevant ministries, espe-cially the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (the famous
MITI) and the Economic Planning Agency,
achieving them unfailingly. From the mid-1950s
onwards, plan after plan, some ten of them inthirty years, were produced, often interrupted,amended or discarded before they could run 
their ﬁve- or ten-year terms. There is no doubt
that in the early post-war years the inﬂuence of
governmental–bureaucratic measures was consid-erable. At ﬁrst, priority was given to coal andsteel, to provide the basic energy and material for
manufacture; then other sectors were successfully
developed – chemical fertilisers, shipbuilding,
cars, machine tools, transistor radios, cameras,television sets, video-recorders and microchips.MITI encouraged the formation of the keiretsu,the pre-war zaibatsus. Mitsubishi and Mitsui wereback in business and huge new conglomerates
came into being, such as the electronic innovator
Sony and car manufacturers Toyota and Nissan.Government–bureaucracy assisted during theearly years in various ways, most importantly by
managing the nation’s ﬁnances and investments
through controlling revenue and banks and by
making cheap loans to targeted industriesthrough the Reconstruction Finance Bank, theExport–Import Bank and the Japan Development
Bank. Industry expanded fast, fed by enormous
investments. Governmental–bureaucratic rules
and legislation in the 1960s and 1970s meanwhile
protected the emerging home industries, employ-ing many devices to prevent foreign imports frombeing competitive – where they could not be kept
out altogether. This was to lead to tension with
the US and Western Europe, which were threat-
ened with a ﬂood of Japanese exports. Japanesetrade unions became steadily more cooperativeafter the more turbulent 1950s; continual con-
servative government and rising prosperity under-
mined union militancy and membership.Undeniably, then, the government–bureaucracyhas played an important role in Japan’s rapid eco-nomic growth. But the notion that it has devel-
oped anything like a command economy is very
misleading. Since 1945, command economies
have failed all over the world. It would be strangeif Japan were the one exception. In fact, Japanesegovernment planning had far more in common
with the approach of Jean Monnet in France, that
is indicative planning, than with Stalinist forms of
control over production, investment, distribution
and pricing. Japan’s economy was and remainsthoroughly capitalist, with a proﬁt-oriented out-look, ﬁercely competitive at home and abroad.
The role of MITI declined after the early 1960s; it
remains a source of supplementary assistance to
industry but it has long since ceased to be decisive.Business leadership, however, was certainly deci-sive. But neither government–bureaucracy nor
business could have generated the colossal invest-
ment in technology necessary for the economies
of scale achieved as huge industrial conglomer-ates were built up but for the availability of funds. These came not from abroad but from the
Japanese man in the street, who lived frugally 
and saved a ﬁfth of his income year after year. 
The rewards of this frugality were not large in 
the short term. The return from interest and thegrowth of pensions was kept very low so thatcompanies could borrow money cheaply. In the
longer term, however, the Japanese did beneﬁt
from industry’s prosperity. Meanwhile, govern-
ment expenditure for non-industrial purposes wasalso held down – welfare payments, housing, theinfrastructure were all neglected. The contrast
between an automated industry employing the
largest number of robots in the world, on the one
hand, and the inadequate sewerage system in
many large cities, the over-crowded roads andextensive pollution, on the other, was the pricepaid for the single-minded pursuit of industrial
growth. The close links between savings, the
banks, their loans to industries good and bad
would lead to trouble later.At the start of the 1960s, the new prime minis-ter, Ikeda Hayato, promised to double everyone’s
income in ten years. Business met this target with
extraordinary rapidity, more than quadrupling1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I649
exports of ships, textiles, cars and electronic goodsduring the 1960s. The effects of this expansionpercolated far beyond the Japanese islands – to
Australia, where the ore was mined to provide
Japan with steel, to the Middle East, which sup-
plied much of its oil, to south-east Asia, especiallyIndonesia and Malaya from which it imported oiland raw materials. The rest of the world took note
and tried to gain access to Japan’s market for
industrial goods. The Japanese government lifted
restrictions and made genuine efforts in the 1980s
to open the home market more freely, to head offinternational hostility, especially from America.But the bureaucracy and business have used
administrative obstacles to make it as difﬁcult as
possible for foreign goods to penetrate the
Japanese market. Japanese business had the advan-tage of the protected home market as a base fromwhich to expand, protection in the end makes
home industry less efﬁcient.Toyota and Nissan began making cars beforethe war, copying British and American designs. In1950 Japanese motor manufacturers producedless than 2,000 cars. To take on the American
giants, Ford and Chrysler, or the British Austin
and Morris seemed a futile ambition. Initially they
made agreements with Western car manufacturers
to use their designs and technology, and theystudied American factories. In 1970 Japan pro-duced 5 million cars, providing Western cus-

tomers with what they wanted at a lower price
than similar Western cars. By the 1990s, to over-
come foreign resentment and pre-empt the exclu-sion of Japanese exports, the Japanese electronicﬁrm Sony and the Japanese car giants had set up
factories in the US and Europe. In industry after
industry, the Japanese improved technically onthe Western product, whether cameras ormachine tools. Then, exploiting heavy invest-
ment, the hard work of a skilled labour force, the
economies that come from large-scale produc-

tion, a more or less closed home market and a
worldwide export market, they raised productiv-ity sharply so that better goods could be pro-duced more cheaply. There is a constant battle for
improvement, for keeping ahead in research,
design and methods of production. The new gen-
eration of computers in the coming information
age is the latest industry to be targeted by Japanto become a world-beater. There will be fewindustries of the twenty-ﬁrst century in which the
Japanese will not excel; one of these, in the 1990s
still dominated by the US, is the aircraft industry.
After a phenomenal growth rate in the GNP of10 per cent a year in the 1960s, annual growthin Japan slowed in the 1970s and 1980s to an
average nearer 6 per cent, but that had the effect
of nearly doubling output in a decade. The highly
praised Japanese model ran out of steam andweaknesses of the ﬁnancial protected industriesbecame apparent. The stagnation of the economy
during the last decade of the twentieth century is
in stark contrast to earlier spectacular growth.Japan is governed by career politicians, byleaders of factions and local ‘favourite sons’returned to the Diet. Allegiance is less to massparties, more to individuals. Politicians play a con-
siderable role in the communities that elect them,
attending hundreds of events, including wed-
dings, funerals and festive occasions, at whichthey are expected to distribute largesse. Theirresulting need for money breeds corruption. They
do favours for their supporters, using their inﬂu-
ence as members of the Diet with ministries. In
return they receive cash donations. For example,
the country farmers enjoying farm subsidiessupport the LDP. The opposition support comesfrom the newer urban areas, which are discrimi-
nated against in that each of their electoral dis-
tricts contains a much larger number of voters
than those in the countryside. This suits the LDP.When getting to Tokyo, young LDP politicianshave to join one of the factions; thereafter they
will gradually rise in the hierarchy of national
politics, increasingly able to bestow favours.650TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949

The Yoshida faction and followers dominatedJapanese politics from 1946 through to the1980s. A rival was Hatoyama, who had earlier
stepped down and passed the presidency to
Yoshida, whom he expected to make way for 
him later. From 1956 to 1960 two protégés ofHatoyama became successively president of theparty and prime minister. But the second of these,
Nobusuke Kishi, fell from power in 1960. Kishi’s
anti-unionist and anti-socialist stance earned him
the hatred of a wide grouping among the oppo-
sition. The renewal of the US–Japanese SecurityTreaty in 1960 became the catalyst that broughtthe opposition on to the streets in April and May
1960. The polarisation, the violence of demon-
strators and police, and the intemperate scenes in
the Diet itself presented the ugly face of Japanesepolitics. These spectacles and the manoeuvring ofthe factions within the LDP forced Kishi to step
down. Hayato Ikeda took his place, representing
the Yoshida line, as did his own successor Eisaku
Sato (1964–72). Eisaku Sato’s selection was prob-ably effected by a deal between Ikeda and Kishi;he had the advantage of being Kishi’s brother,
and he proved himself a very adept politician.Sato’s eight years in ofﬁce were notable for theestrangement between Japan and the US arising
out of the Nixon administration’s demands thatJapanese textile exports to the US should berestricted. Nonetheless, the renewal of the
US–Japanese Security Treaty in June 1970
prompted Nixon, after much Japanese agitation,
to promise to return Okinawa, and an agreementto that effect was concluded in June 1971. Amonth later relations were soured again by
Nixon’s announcement that he would visit China;
his failure to inform Japan of this reversal of US
policy towards Nationalist China on Taiwan,
which the Japanese had hitherto supported,greatly angered the Japanese, who did not relishbeing treated as very much a junior partner in
Asia. The second ‘Nixon shock’, in August 1971,
was a devaluation of the dollar – in effect making
Japanese exports more expensive – and the impo-sition of a temporary import surcharge. TheJapanese interpreted America’s defensive eco-

nomic moves as unfriendly to themselves. These
foreign-policy difficulties and internal LDPmanoeuvres ended Sato’s premiership. In July1972, after bitter internal feuding between Sato’stwo principal lieutenants, the younger, more
ambitious Kakuei Tanaka defeated Takeo Fukuda
to win the presidency and become prime minister.Tanaka was unusually active in foreign affairs.He visited Beijing, following in Nixon’s footsteps,and toured south-east Asia, where memories of
the Japanese occupation were still too recent to
ensure a good reception. In Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand, demonstrators carried
placards demanding ‘Tanaka Go Home’. His pre-miership was anyway a stormy one. In 1973 theArab–Israeli War produced the shock of the qua-
drupling in the price of oil. This hit Japan par-
ticularly badly, as it depended overwhelmingly for
oil on the Middle East, and there was widespreadpanic. Tanaka now called in his arch-rival TakeoFukuda, a ﬁnancial expert, to take charge of the
Ministry of Finance. Fukuda imposed drastic
measures to squeeze the economy. It worked. By
1975 the Japanese economy was expanding oncemore by a healthy 6 per cent, which it continuedto do for the rest of the decade. Tanaka’s ambi-
tious plans to develop the Japanese regions had
been put into cold storage and were only gradu-
ally revived after 1975. More signiﬁcantly, Japan
took effective steps to reduce its reliance for poweron Middle Eastern oil by securing alternativesources and developing nuclear power stations.Even among Japanese political leaders, Tanakawas exceptional in the power and money he com-
manded. Institutionalised corruption had reachednew heights. In the end publicity about his ﬁnan-cial misdeeds in Japan and in the foreign press
undermined his standing. The LDP factions
agreed to replace him with a minor ﬁgure, Takeo
Miki, to restore an image of propriety. But Miki
proved rather too energetic in trying to reformthe LDP, especially when he had Tanaka arrestedin 1976 for accepting bribes in the Lockheed 
aircraft-purchase scandal. Lockheed had handed
over $12 million in bribes to Japanese bureaucrats
and politicians, including Tanaka, to ensure thatthe aircraft order went to them. Tanaka spentonly a short time in jail and was then let out on
bail, still a power-broker behind the scenes
among the LDP factions. The close of the 1970s1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I651
was a turbulent time in internal LDP politics, andfrom 1978 to 1982 further tame successors werefound.In November 1982 the LDP factions ofTanaka and Suzuki chose Yasuhiro Nakasone for
the presidency and premiership. He turned out tobe much more decisive and more of his own manthan Tanaka or Suzuki liked. His success in
winning the general election of 1986 enabled him
to stay a further year in ofﬁce, although LDP rules
would normally have required him to hand over
the presidency that year.Nakasone wanted to break away from Japan’soutdated traditions, to remove the heavy hand of
centralised control with its myriad regulations,
and so prepare the way for a new phase of eco-
nomic growth. He asserted Japan’s claim torespect from the world’s powers, a claim thatentailed losing its pygmy international status and
its dependency on the US. In 1986 he hosted the
annual summit of leading industrial nations in
Tokyo and that same year visited Beijing. Warguilt was now part of history. He would leadJapan, backed by popular approval, in the
American presidential style.Nakasone’s self-conﬁdence and his promise ofa more active Japanese foreign policy were wel-
comed by Western leaders. Visiting Washingtonin 1983, Nakasone promised President ReaganJapan’s active assistance in the containment of the
Soviet Union. He toured south-east Asia and
indicated that he was ready to expand Japan’s mil-
itary capacity. But his attempt to revise the con-stitution for this purpose so alarmed the Japanesethat he promised not to go ahead during his ﬁrst
term of ofﬁce. Nakasone engaged in high diplo-
macy with a relish, but government efforts to
open the domestic market to foreign goods, as
the rest of the world was demanding, were con-stantly frustrated by bureaucracy and business.Every year Japan amassed huge balance-of-
payments surpluses, while the US had to cope
with the largest debt in the world. The deﬁcit was
in part managed by Japan recycling its surplusinto the purchase of US treasury bonds. But theJapanese also bought many physical assets abroad
– real estate in California, the Rockefeller Center
in New York, factories in America and Europe.Japan’s ﬁnancial and manufacturing power glob-ally seemed to be on an ever continuing upwardtrajectory. When Nakasone ﬁnally left ofﬁce in
November 1987, his reputation internationally
and at home was at its peak. He had achieved a
great deal during his ﬁve years in ofﬁce, aligningJapan more closely with the West and freeing itfrom its shackles of tradition. But Japanese
politics were about to take a surprising turn.Nakasone’s successor, after much factionalstruggle, was Noboru Takeshita, who enjoyed
Nakasone’s support. Takeshita continued Naka-sone’s foreign travels, exhibiting thereby a moreindependent Japanese foreign policy, though the
American alliance remained the bedrock, despite
growing trade tensions. Progress towards closer
relations with China, however, was temporarilyupset by the Chinese leadership’s brutality in themassacre of Tiananmen Square. Takeshita’s
efforts at home were concentrated on reducing
direct taxation and increasing indirect taxation
through a sales tax, which was especially unpop-ular with the poorer Japanese families. But themost sensational event of the Takeshita premier-
ship was the uncovering of yet more corruption
in what became known as the ‘Recruit scandal’.
The Recruit group operated in publishing, real
estate and other areas, and it needed favourabledecisions from the government and bureaucrats ifit was to expand and start making large proﬁts.
To gain favours, the group not only lavished legal
donations on the political parties but also made
illegal payments to politicians and ofﬁcials. As
usual, money had been needed in the leadershiprace between the factions in 1986, and huge
profits were made by Nakasone’s ministers in
illicit share-dealings. The scandal broke in 1988
and its investigation continued into the following
year. Even Prime Minister Takeshita had receivedpolitical donations and was forced to resign.Many suspected Nakasone too, but he was not
formally charged. Nonetheless, the standing of
LDP politicians reached a low point in public
esteem, and for the ﬁrst time it looked as if theparty might lose power. Sousuke Uno, the newpresident and prime minister, did not last long
when a sex scandal arose to titillate the public.
Next, Toshiki Kaifu became prime minister and652TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
leader of the LDP; he pulled the party togetherand promised to rid it of corrupt politicians.It was enough. In 1990 the LDP was securelyback in absolute power after a landslide victory.
The dream that a charismatic female politician,
Takako Doi, who led the Japan Socialist Party,might effect a decisive change in Japanese politicson two counts – forcing the LDP into opposition
and advancing the cause of what was very much
the second sex in Japan – quickly faded again. The
majority preferred to stick with the party that had
presided over Japan’s growing prosperity.But the Japanese miracle began to fade in1990. Financial scandals continued to undermine
the standing of ministers and leading members of
the LDP. Some of the most renowned names
among securities companies had manipulatedstock-market prices by agreeing to compensatesome favoured clients against losses. Production
plummeted, loans based on inﬂated house and
land prices turned into bad debts, the Stock
Exchange registered huge losses and the wholeﬁnancial fabric appeared threatened.Kaifu was regarded as a weak prime ministerby the barons of the LDP factions, a good
stopgap while scandals still hung in the air.
During his two years in ofﬁce Kaifu nevertheless
was very popular among the Japanese people as aclean politician. This mattered little to the LDPand in October 1991 Shin Kanemaru, the most
powerful of the barons and chairman of the
Takeshita faction, forged the necessary alliances in
the corridors of power so that the premiershipshould fall to Kiichi Miyazawa. Miyazawa hadbeen minister of ﬁnance at the time of the Recruit
ﬁnancial scandal and had resigned in December
1988. His return to politics was intended to mark
the end of any recriminations. Cabinet posts were
distributed among the factions. Miyazawa facednew challenges. The trade surplus with the USwas the cause of considerable tension while
America remained bogged down in recession, and
President Bush’s visit to Tokyo in January 1992
did little to repair the image of the US, unable tocompete with Japan in manufactures such as auto-mobiles where it was once the world leader.Miyazawa, who abandoned most of Kaifu’sreform programme, was saddled in 1992 with anew investigation of a financial scandal thatpromised to be bigger even than the Recruitaffair. Known as Sagawa, it concerned the hand-
outs made to some hundred politicians, mainly
LDP, including two Cabinet ministers. Sagawa
Kyubin was a parcel-delivery ﬁrm that went intobankruptcy with huge debts. It was one scandaltoo many. The political power-broker Shin
Kanemaru was forced to resign in October 1992.
A breakaway faction of the LDP formed the
Renewal party. Elections in July 1993 resulted in
a political upheaval. The LDP fell from power.Morihiro Hosokawa headed a new seven-partycoalition government committed to reform until
his fall in April 1994.The contrast between Japanese politics – faction-ridden, endemically prone to scandal – andJapan’s success as an economic superpower sub-verts the claim that in all regions of the world
democracy is essential for prosperity. Indeed,
prosperity has undermined the growth of a
healthy democracy in Japan and in the more pros-perous nations of Asia – Taiwan, Singapore andThailand, not to mention Hong Kong. There is 
a parallel here with China, where Deng too
believed that the great majority of the people
would accept the communist political system as
long as it delivered rising standards of living; con-versely, democracy would be in danger wherestandards fell. Will Japan break this cycle and 
combine democracy and prosperity?Unlike the inhabitants of many countries inthe world, the Japanese enjoy civil liberties, andtheir government is neither dictatorial norauthoritarian. If it were, the politicians would not
have to distribute so much largesse and favours
to ensure their reselection. They have to keep on
the right side of the people. Politics is marginal
to the ordinary Japanese, except for necessaryfavours, his own job prospects, education and theoutlook for his children. Material progress and
security are what matter. Fo those who won
places in the right schools, universities and com-
panies, there were jobs for life. The company tookcare of you, and you owed it absolute loyalty. Itwas good for those who were ‘in’ – once they sur-
vived the fearsome competition. There is a place,
too, for those who are ‘out’, but there is also1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I653
much frustration and crime. In the early 1990sgrowth stalled, industrial and banking profitsplunged. The last decade of the twentieth century
brought changes and challenged old customs.Future peace in Asia depends on the relationsbetween the US, Japan and China. Japan has hadto adjust to the fact that in the 1990s its economy
was faced with economic difﬁculties and debt-
ridden banks. Once all that mattered was the
peaceful pursuit of global economic power, which
had replaced Japan’s military aspirations. Concernfor the quality of life and for the environmenttook second place and the Japanese accepted that
a benevolent bureaucracy would manage much of
their lives. Education provided post-war genera-
tions with equality of opportunity. But it was thebureaucrats rather than the politicians whowielded economic and legislative power. Dealings
between companies, bureaucrats and the politi-
cians of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),
which continued to govern Japan, had becomecorrupt. Bribery scandals surrounding the politi-cians became high-proﬁle news, but the bureau-
crats involved largely escaped detection. The LDP
fall from power in 1994 did not mark a dramatic
change in Japanese politics. By the October 1996
general election the LDP was again the leadingparty in the coalition government; fundamentalchange would prove elusive. The LDP prime min-
ister, Ryutaro Hasimoto, promised ‘administra-
tive’ reforms of the bureaucracy but little was
achieved. Changes in the conduct of politicianswill take even longer; the old party bosses of theLDP still pull the strings from behind the scenes.The stagnation, in the 1990s, of Asia’s biggesteconomy and the second largest in the world, 
still did not look like ending in the early twenty-
ﬁrst century. The boom of the 1980s turned tobust, property prices fell to lows not imagined,the Stock Exchange slumped by three-quarters,
unemployment rose to heights that made the
Japanese fearful. Although, at under 5 per cent,
it was good by European standards, still it meantthat a culture of a job for life in one of Japan’slarge corporations was changing, many businesses
went bankrupt. All at once the greatly admired
‘Japan model’ that had served the country wellsince the Second World War was blamed for sti-ﬂing change and bureaucratic sclerosis. An indi-cator of Japan’s loss of self confidence in its
managerial skills was the take-over by French
Renault of ailing Nissan especially when
European management turned it around. Whathad gone so drastically wrong in Japan?Politics were dominated by the LDP whichwas slow to react to new conditions at home and
in the world. The overexuberance of Japanese and
foreign investors sent shares to unsustainable
multiples of earnings. Investors from abroadpoured in funds. Banks in cosy relationships withJapanese conglomerates, the keiretsu lent moneyrecklessly, small businesses were showered with
easy ﬁnance, all leading to a huge build-up debt.
But no sector was as unrealistic as property prices– by the close of the 1980s Tokyo’s real estatewas valued as the equivalent of the whole of the
US. When the property prices slumped to a frac-
tion of their former value the banks that had
ﬁnanced the boom were in trouble, saddled withbad loans. The Asian economic crisis of 1997 and1998 did the rest, debts of businesses threatened
to bankrupt them. The government stepped in,
guaranteeing the savings of the people who oth-
erwise would have panicked and caused an eco-
nomic meltdown. Japan began to suffer fromdeﬂation, next year’s prices would be lower thanthis year’s, the frightened public more uncertain
of the future, saved more and consumption in
Japan dropped adding further to Japan’s woes,
the currency lost value to the dollar, but exportsof world-leading companies alone were not sufﬁ-cient to counteract consumer loss of conﬁdence
at home. Japan was caught in a spiral of low
growth. With near zero interest rates even inefﬁ-
cient companies could ‘service’ their loans and
stay aﬂoat. Then during the early years of the newmillennium, the US was struck by its own ‘eco-nomic bubble’, world growth slowed, Japan’s
export markets became more difﬁcult. After more
than ten years of such a depressing trend, possi-
bly the main obstacle to any dramatic improve-ment is the low expectations of the Japanesepeople who see no hope in political change.The Japanese absence of a ‘feel good’ factorwas reinforced by the poor performance of suc-654TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
cessive LDP governments and the uninspiringchoice of leaders by a cabal of powerful eldersbehind the scenes. Hasimoto admitted failure in
1998 and was succeeded by Keizo Obuchu, avun-
cular and unpretentious he did rather better,
introducing some cautious reforms; in April 2000Obuchu was felled by a stroke and died before heachieved very much, however. The elders of the
Liberal Democrat Party then gathered in secret in
Tokyo’s Akasaka Prince Hotel and from their
deliberations Yoshiro Mori emerged as caretaker
prime minister. He performed so badly that hewas pushed aside and ‘resigned’. His successor,Junichiro Koizumi, broke the mould of elderly,
staid politicians. He looked different for a start,
more with it, like a rock star with a trademark
shock of hair. For once the LDP power-brokershad clearly chosen someone who was popularlyacclaimed by the voters placing their hopes on the
exterior of his appearance. Koizumi may well have
been genuine when promising radical reform. He
called an election in 2001 campaigning for theLDP. They won in the Diet and dictated the paceof change. The power-brokers of the LDP had
not lost control. Koizumi was unfortunate to
come to ofﬁce during the economic world down-
turn. Deep reforms would cause massive pain.
The LDP did not change its ways, continued thepalliative of printing money, increased Japan’shigh debt to ﬁnance a wasteful public works pro-
gramme to prevent rising unemployment, and did
not clean up the failing banking sector, the root
of the problem. Some moderate reform openedJapan cautiously to fairer competition at home.Some keiretsushave improved their efﬁciency bylaying off workers and manufacturing abroad and
supporting factories in mainland China. But the
banks, burdened with bad loans, remained an
obstacle to ﬁnancial health. The big monopolieshave not been broken up, the stimulus of cuttinginterest rates has been applied to the point whereit can go no further as interest rates are set closeto zero, the huge public works budget was only
slightly reduced. Eventually, the economy will
emerge from the doldrums and perhaps sooner
than was expected, in 2003.Despite the stagnation of more than a decadeand the destruction of individual wealth, the
annual Gross Domestic Product at around
$38,000 per head is still the highest in Asia.
Abroad, Japan has followed a cautious policy of
improving relations with its neighbours. Koizumieven normalised relations with North Korea bypaying the Dear Leader a visit. But security is
founded on the military shield of its US ally. There
was debate about modifying its ‘peace constitu-

tion’ in which the Japanese people foreverrenounced war as a sovereign right of the nationand the threat or use of force as means of settling
international disputes; Japan further undertook
that land, sea, and air forces would never be main-

tained (Article 9 of the Constitution of 1946). Thereality is that Japan does have armed forces, mod-
est army, navy and air units for self-defence which
may support US forces, but cannot ﬁght offen-

sively abroad though Japan has supported a peace
mission in Afghanistan under UN auspices. Public
opinion remains strongly averse to any enhancedmilitary role. But Japan lies at the crossroads of a volatile tense region of China, Taiwan, North
and South Korea. Of greatest concern has been 
the development of missiles by the North Korean
regime. Their capacity was demonstrated when in 1998 a first-generation missile passed overJapan into the Pacific; it was probably not
intended as a threat, but was most likely a space
shot whose third stage had failed. Still there is no
complacency about North Korea’s missile capabil-

ity. North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, once assistedby Pakistan, and probable possession of a small1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I655

number of nuclear bombs, heightened the tensionin the new millennium. In the face of the threatJapan has not sought to shelter in neutrality in
place of reliance on the US alliance but is anxious
to play a role in cooling tensions in the region.The ‘other’ China, the Republic of China onTaiwan, was founded when the remnants of
Chiang Kai-shek’s army withdrew to the island 
in 1949. Some 20,000 Taiwanese who resisted
Kuomintang rule were killed that year and martial
law was imposed. Under American protection andwith American forces stationed in Taiwan, ChiangKai-shek and the ageing Kuomintang party and
military leaders were able to rebuild a formidable
military force of half a million men, ruling over
the native Taiwanese with only the façade of aconstitutional process. Security police ensuredthat no opposition could make itself felt for long.
Despite American influence, civil liberties and
democracy were given no real opportunity to take
root. Politically, Taiwan was an ally, and as suchthe Kuomintang acted internally as it thoughtbest. Taiwan was poor, but even under the
Kuomintang economic progress was achieved in
the production of textiles and simple electronic
goods such as transistor radios. Chiang Kai-shek
died in 1975, and after an interval was succeededby his eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, in 1978.The rapprochement of the US and thePeople’s Republic of China gradually led to the
withdrawal of US troops (in 1979) and of US
diplomatic recognition. Chiang Ching-kuo had toreadjust Taiwan’s international stance. He cau-tiously improved relations with the People’s
Republic, and trade and other links expanded.
The leaders in Beijing, meanwhile, had no inten-
tion any longer of attempting to unify China by
force. At home Chiang Ching-kuo likewise grad-ually followed a reforming policy, having to carrywith him the gerontocracy of Chiang Kai-shek’s
former political and military companions. He
ﬁnally lifted martial law in 1987 and permitted a
multi-party system to evolve. On his death, Vice-President Lee Teng-hui, the ﬁrst Taiwanese tohead the Kuomintang, became president and con-
tinued the reforms of the fragile democratic
process. Taiwan’s human rights record had previ-ously been lamentable; in contrast, its economicgrowth was another of the so-called economicmiracles, giving it an income per head twenty
times greater than mainland China’s.Lee Teng-hui won the elections of 1988, andcontinued to move away from the old authoritar-ian style. The most important foreign issue was toregularise relations with mainland China and
democratise politics at home. He encouraged
family visits with the mainland and economic
links. When in the spring of 1996 he campaigned
against the ‘one China’ formula, he brought thewrath of Beijing on his head. Missiles were ﬁredinto the Taiwanese Straits as a warning that China
would invade if independence was declared and
the US countered by moving two aircraft carriers
within striking distance. The crisis passed to berepeated during the presidential election cam-
paign of 1999. After the elections both sides
cooled their rhetoric once again.The changes in Taiwanese politics had begunin 1987 when martial law, in existence for morethan three decades, was lifted. Reforms to createa multi-party state were introduced. On 1 May
1991 Taiwan declared the forty-two-year ‘com-
munist rebellion’ at an end, code for recognising
the regime in Beijing. Reform at home made 
possible a historic change in July 2000 when the opposition candidate of the DemocraticProgressive Party Chen Shui-bian won the presi-
dential election. Talk of declaring independence
receded. Taiwan, too, had to adjust to the eco-
nomic crisis in Asia of 1997 and meet the chal-lenges of the new millennium.Another Chinese ‘miracle’ is Hong Kong, whichhas no resources except the ingenuity of its 
merchants and the enterprise of its Chinese 
population. Capitalist Hong Kong adjoins thecommunist mainland of China, on which it isdependent for water and food imports. Its geo-
graphical position makes it, in practical terms,
indefensible. Hong Kong island was seized by
Britain in 1841, and more territory was forciblysecured in 1860. Then in 1898 the Chinese weremade to lease the so-called New Territories for
ninety-nine years, in what then looked like
becoming a ‘scramble for China’. The lease656TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
expired in 1997, and the prosperous colony ofHong Kong rejoined the rest of China.Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative governmenttried to make the best of this predicament by
negotiating conditions for the return of the
Crown colony, at a time (the mid-1980s) whenthe presence in ofﬁce of a reform-minded Chineseleadership seemed to promise a liberal future. In
the Sino-British Joint Declaration negotiated in
1984, China pronounced that the government of
Hong Kong would be composed of local people
and that what would be known as the HongKong Special Administrative Region would enjoya high degree of autonomy. Britain, afraid to
offend Beijing, declined to pre-empt the choice
of a system of representation by creating a wholly
elected legislature before the Chinese takeover.The Declaration promised that the:current social and economic systems in HongKong will remain unchanged, and so will the
life-style. Rights and freedoms, including thoseof the person, of speech, of the press, of assem-bly ... of travel ... [as well as] private prop-

erty [and] ... foreign investment will be

protected by law.But Beijing’s Basic Law for Hong Kong, pub-lished in April 1988, raised fears that HongKong’s freedoms and autonomy would not be
respected after 1 July 1997 and would make
meaningless Beijing’s doctrine of ‘one country,
two systems’. In June 1989 the TiananmenSquare massacre of the student demonstrators notonly aroused passionate sympathy in Hong Kong,
but further undermined conﬁdence in a Chinese
takeover.For the ﬁrst time in its history elections wereheld in Hong Kong in September 1991. But theLegislative Council was still dominated by nomi-
nees, just over two-thirds chosen by the governor
and just over one-third by professional bodies,
leaving only eighteen of sixty seats to be contested.
China’s shadow loomed over Hong Kong’s devel-
opment. The attempts belatedly to broaden repre-
sentative government before the take-over as
proposed in 1993 by the British governor was
sharply condemned in Beijing. Democracy isanathema to Beijing. Only 50,000 favoured HongKong British passport holders were allowed tocome to Britain. The future of the more than 3.5
million people of prosperous Hong Kong lies with
China. The people of Hong Kong have been
watchful and deﬁant in the new millennium, mas-
sively demonstrating against any Beijing attemptsto circumscribe their freedom and the bases of
their prosperity.The Chinese of Singapore are much more fortu-nate in having their own independent island stateto which no one else lays claim. Singapore, whichhas been independent since it seceded from the
Federation of Malaysia in 1965, is a well-ordered
state with a democratic constitution, although
one party, the People’s Action Party, has ruledsince 1959. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, whoheaded the government for thirty-one years until
he stepped down in 1990, was notable for his
authoritarian tendency, his incorruptibility and his
almost puritanical zeal for law and order, whichextended to requiring long-haired youths to cuttheir hair short. In common with Thailand and
some other Asian countries, Singapore combated
the drug menace with draconian laws, including
the death penalty. It was, at best, half a democ-
racy. Opposition politicians and parties wereallowed, but the Internal Security Act passed in1963 permitted the authorities to detain suspects
without trial, and the power of the courts to
review administrative decisions was severely
restricted. Repressive politically, Singapore waseconomically free – enterprise was encouragedand since the island, like Hong Kong, was
without resources except ﬁsh, manufacture and
trade ﬂourished.Lee kept a watchful eye on his chosen succes-sor, Goh Chok Tong, remaining in the govern-ment as ‘senior minister’ and staying as generalsecretary of the Action Party. Democratic progress
of sorts was made in Singapore in the general elec-
tion held in August 1991, when the opposition
quadrupled its representation, from one to fourmembers, albeit swamped by the ruling ActionParty’s seventy-seven. Singapore remained an eco-
nomic powerhouse in Asia in the 1990s, robustly
tied to the West – the government welcoming the1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I657
US ﬂeet, which was offered facilities in Singaporeafter the Americans lost their Philippine bases.In 1990, unlike other south-east Asian leaders,Lee Kuan Yew did not leave under a cloud but
was deeply respected and was given the title of
senior minister. His inﬂuence behind the scenesremained considerable, his legacy of a well-ordered state, derided by some as a ‘nanny state’,
endured. Singapore is the cleanest city in the
world, there is no graﬁtti or chewing gum, hooli-
gans receive strokes of the cane. Society is orderly
and well behaved, the atmosphere restrictive, but the 4 million people enjoy the highest livingstandards in Asia. The democracy established here
was, in effect, one-party rule through repression
but by the consent of the majority. The opposi-
tion in the legislature has become more lively butis powerless and small.The economic crisis of 1997 did not passSingapore by, but Singapore soon recovered. As
a developed nation, Singapore faces new chal-
lenges in trade and its economy, surrounded bycountries that can manufacture the goods thatmade Singapore rich, more cheaply. There are
now, in the new millennium, no development
models to follow any longer. The high degree of
education and business skills of Singapore’s
people, the absence of crime and conﬂict providesa good base for the future.After the terrible devastation of war, Korea wasstill a partitioned country in the early 1990s.
Sporadic talk of bringing the two Koreastogether, of uniting families again, had made littleprogress. No personality cult anywhere equalled
the excesses of worship bestowed on Comrade
Kim Il Sung, the longest-ruling communist dic-
tator in the world. He had presided over the
‘democratic’ Korean Republic since 1948 and wasalready a veteran communist then. There was nofreedom in North Korea, with its showpiececapital Pyongyang, its huge and costly military
establishment and all the trappings of an oppres-
sive one-party state. Living standards were
appallingly low in consequence and did notcompare with those in the South.The history of South Korea can be told in twoquite different ways. When the world came to
Seoul in 1988 and the XXIV Olympic Games
were televised, a ﬁne modern city came into view
with well-dressed people in the streets. The eco-nomic recovery and industrial growth of SouthKorea, which accelerated after the 1970s, now
place it in Asia’s club of rich nations. The other
side of South Korea’s history, however, has to
recount the violence and brutality of its politics.For most of the years since the early 1950s themilitary ruled Korea oppressively, violent student
and popular protests were put down with force
and bloodshed. Aligned with the West, especially
with the US, South Korea had to make someshow of a democratic process with a nationalassembly and elections. But the military made
sure that they held on to power, ruling under
martial law, imprisoning opposition leaders and
resorting to torture and bloodshed to suppress
demonstrators who, in their frustration, fre-quently turned to violence. The ruling cliqueswere identiﬁed by those who opposed them with
the US, so anti-American and anti-military agita-
tion often merged. For the Americans such
authoritarian regimes were an embarrassment, butpressure to democratise took second place before1990 to the global aim of containing commu-
nism. South Korea was a frontline state of the free
world, and the credentials of the South Korean
rulers as implacable opponents of communism
were never in doubt.658TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949

South Korea’s ﬁrst president, Syngman Rhee,lasted until 1960. By then the old autocrat hadlost his grip and was forced to bow out after
student-led riots in April of that year, protesting
against corruption and election fraud. There was
a brief hope that the politicians might create atleast the semblance of civilian, democratic gov-ernment. After some months of turmoil, in May
1961 the military stepped in and a junta led by
Major-General Park Chung Hee took control.
His repressive military-police regime allowed just
enough leeway in the 1970s for political activityto function sporadically. But, whenever suchactivities threatened to become too assertive or
violent, Park reimposed rigid control by emer-
gency decree, arresting opposition politicians and
suspending civil rights. Suppression would be fol-lowed by a measure of liberalisation, as long as itdid not threaten military power. Korea’s chief of
intelligence assassinated him in October 1979. A
civilian president was tolerated for nine months
but the military remained the real power in theland.In 1980 a new general took over, GeneralChun Doo-Hwan, who was no less determined to
keep the opposition under ﬁrm control than Park.
The 1980s, like the 1970s, were plagued by peri-
odic demonstrations and riots answered by policetruncheons, ﬁrearms and torture. The killings inthe riotous town of Kwangju in May 1980, when
hundreds lost their lives, were just the worst of
these. But Korea’s rapid industrial development
made it desirable to create a better image in theWest. The opposition was again allowed a degreeof activity, political prisoners were released, and
the most prominent opposition leaders, Kim Dae-
Jung and Kim Young, were from time to time
freed from house arrest and allowed to campaign.
In 1987, on the eve of the Olympics, a relativelyfree presidential election was held. The general’snominee, Roh Tae-Woo, won, but the opposition
would have succeeded instead had they been able
to close ranks behind a single candidate. Without
full democracy it is difﬁcult, if not impossible, forpolitical parties and institutions to develop, whichare necessary for democracy to function. So South
Korean politics were caught in a vicious circle.
Roh Tae-Woo was prepared to allow a widermargin of political freedom than his predecessors.In May 1990 the opposition was strengthenedand gained a majority in the National Assembly
when two opposition parties combined. The well-
known dissident Kim Young Sam, leader of the
Liberal Democratic Party, was elected presidentin December 1992. He took ofﬁce in February1993, the ﬁrst civilian president in 32 years.The dichotomy between political backward-ness and economic modernisation had been 
a characteristic since 1962. For the ordinary
Korean, politics took second place to materialwelfare, which so rapidly increased for the major-ity of the people. Opposition politics and violent
demonstrations were for the young and for the
minority of political activists, not for the major-
ity. For those who did not actively oppose, therewas not only far greater prosperity but alsogreater freedom in the South. The inﬂuence of
the generals receded, and the president tackled
corruption; democratisation made some headway.
In the North, nothing much was to change untilKim Il Sung died in 1992 and was succeeded byhis son the ‘dear leader’.By the 1990s the reuniﬁcation of Korea hadfor long been one of the demands of the radical
opposition. All politicians in the South were in
favour of it; it was the ofﬁcial policy, and visits ofgovernment delegations from the North and theSouth were exchanged in 1990 and in 1991. In
December 1991 the communist North and the
capitalist South at their ﬁfth meeting signed a
non-aggression pact. The meetings continued in1992. North Korea was working towards themanufacture of nuclear weapons. The Americans
withdrew their army from the South, so President
Roh’s prime interest was to stop the North from
making its own bomb. The whole of Korea,
according to the wishes of the South, of Japanand of the US, should be free of nuclear weapons.South Korean enthusiasm for merger with the
North was at its height when Germany reuniﬁed
in 1989, but it waned in the light of German
experience. The population of the North with itslow standard of living is far greater proportion-ately to the South’s than East Germany’s was to
its well-off Western cousins. The Korean statistics
bring out this contrast very sharply.1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I659

heights. Japan also felt threatened by the situa-
tion’s volatility. Reductions in the large armies
and numerous weapons, a tremendous burdenespecially to the North, a lessening of tension andmore intercourse between North and South
nevertheless brought their own tangible beneﬁts
to a people who had suffered so much in the
twentieth century.North Korea remains one of the last unrecon-structed communist dictatorships. Its ‘Dear
Leader’ lives in luxury while the people starve.
Famine in 1997 caused the deaths of possibly as
many as 2 million. The population survives atsubsistence level at best, the gap in its grain madeup mainly by China and also the West. This does
not deter Kim Jong Il from diverting scarce
resources to a million-strong army, a missile and
a nuclear programme at the Yongbyon nuclearcomplex. The 1993/4 crisis, when North Koreathreatened to produce bomb-usable plutonium
by reprocessing fuel rods, was resolved by Clinton
concluding a ‘Framework Agreement’. The US
would build two Light Water reactors less ca-
pable of plutonium production and supply oiluntil they were built, and in return North Koreaundertook to freeze plutonium production.
North Korea also signed the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty. In October 2002 a new crisis
erupted. North Korea threatened to reactivate the plutonium reactor at Yongbyon and processfuel rods enabling it to make nuclear weapons. In
December the international supervisory inspectors
were thrown out and Kim threatened to discard
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.The timing was well chosen as Bush waspreparing for war against Iraq. The response fromWashington in partnership with South Korea and
Japan was to stop the supply of fuel oil essential
to North Korea as the construction of the two
reactors promised in 1994 had hardly begun. Asa member of Bush’s ‘axis of evil’, a regime thatcould not be allowed to acquire weapons of mass
destruction, North Korea’s challenge could not
have been more direct. The US went to war with
Iraq to destroy Saddam’s weapons of mass
destruction which he had not been proven topossess, but resorted to diplomacy with NorthKorea which almost certainly had nuclear bombs
already. The apparent inconsistency is not difﬁcult
to understand. South Korea is exposed to a North
Korean army of overwhelming strength. The37,000 US troops can act as no more than a tripwire in the event of an invasion. The US would
have to risk a nuclear war in defence of the South.
By sacriﬁcing the welfare of the people to build
his military arsenal Kim believes himself safe fromattack. He demonstrated his deﬁance in 2003 byﬁring a cruise missile into the sea of Japan and
sending ﬁghters to force down a US spy plane.
His regime may one day implode, but this is
something China is anxious to avoid as it would
upset the strategic balance. The reactivation in2003 of the nuclear bomb programme wascausing the greatest worry. The disarmament and
neutralisation of the Korean peninsula is a distant
hope.In the South the political leaders and the bossesof the big conglomerates, the chaebols, are beingcalled to account for misrule and corruption.
President Kim Young Sam was elected on an anti-
corruption platform. His two predecessors were1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I661

leaders while in ofﬁce. Kim Dae-Jung, former dis-sident, was elected president as the decade drewto a close in December 1997.South Korea was one of the most successful ofthe ‘Asian Tigers’, its economy boosted by global
exports. In this South Korea was following the
ﬁrst of the ‘Tigers’, Japan. But lax governmentmanagement, foreign debts, as well as competi-tion from Asian countries with lower labour costs
have created problems. Corruption in business
and politics has been endemic. Twenty-three
bosses of the big industrial conglomerates, thechaebols, were convicted of bribing the two dis-graced ex-presidents General Chun and Roh Tae-
Woo, but escaped prison terms. A country can
manage without ex-presidents but not without its
business leaders.By the autumn of 1997 the ‘Asian Tigers’ hadlost their bounce – not only Japan and South
Korea but also the younger more virile Tigers.
Stability and investor confidence, with money
from abroad readily available, had brought rapid,
seemingly unstoppable, growth. The abundanceof cheap credit led to mismanagement and excess:building – especially of ofﬁce block skyscrapers –
boomed. And then the giddy ride shuddered to
a halt and investor panic even engulfed the
sounder economies of Hong Kong and Singapore.North Korea’s military threat hangs as a shadowover South Korea. Kim Dae-Jung adopted a policy
of reconciliation with the North. Kim and his
regime, he believed, should be engaged not con-
demned to containment and isolation which
would, he believed, only increase the paranoia ofthe leadership. His ‘sunshine policy’ reached itsclimax when he met with Kim Jong Il in 2000,
both exuding smiles and friendship. The South
Korean president promised ﬁnancial assistance and
development help in return for closer linksbetween the two countries, open road and raillinks and for families torn apart by the Korean
war to be able to visit. Rather prematurely Kim
Dae-Jung was rewarded for his efforts with theNobel Peace Prize. In 2003 it emerged that thewheels had been oiled by a bribe of a large sumpaid by a company in the Hyundai chaebolto the ‘Dear Leader’, it is alleged with Kim Dae-Jung’s
knowledge. In South Korea politics were
enlivened by the corruption scandal investigation.Kim Jong Il was able to play on the resentmentof a new generation of South Korean anti-
Americanism which had its roots in ethnic resent-
ment and, justiﬁably, in protest at the American
support for past corrupt military regimes. Kim
Dae-Jung’s dissident politics in Korea remainedfar from clean. Corporate ‘donations’ and votebuying distorted the democratic process. In rela-
tions with the North, Kim saw no alternative to
the policy of engagement he was following
though it has yielded little positive results afterthe ﬁrst media-hyped family reunions.While Kim Dae-Jung’s ﬁve-year record as apolitical reformer does not shine, his govern-
ment engineered a spectacular turn around of the
economy from its depths in 1997. Once Japanwas the model, now Korea can serve Japan as anexample. The medicine was drastic. The IMF pro-
vided a loan to save the country from bankruptcy.
The chaebols, Korea’s largest conglomerates, over-laden with debt, were forced to restructure, those
that were unable to survive ﬁnancially were notbailed out but went to the wall or were taken overby foreign companies such as Daewoo managed
by US General Motors. The culture of business
secrecy and corruption was tackled. The banking
system was overloaded with bad debts. Banksunable to deal with them were taken over by thestate. Western management skills were intro-

duced, the country opened to competition and
deregulation. The pain was great, unemployment
soared. The people, however, responded to the
crisis with dogged determination to build theirindustries anew on a sounder basis. Inefﬁcientbusinesses were forced into bankruptcy. Within
two years, South Korea was back on a healthy
growth rate, once more attracting foreign invest-
ment but this time into a sound economy.Employment is back to pre-crisis levels. Yet theone thing the people wished for remained unful-
ﬁlled, the lifting of the threat of the armistice
frontier and the uniﬁcation of the country.662TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
The December 2002 presidential electionswere won by the more progressive Roh Moo-hynwho beat a conservative candidate. The issue of
how to deal with the North was a central issue.
Roh Moo-hyn campaigned on the promise tocontinue the ‘sunshine policy’ and end corruptionand was inaugurated in February 2003. Despiterising resentment of the US, which had supported
past military regimes, the bedrock of security
remained the US alliance.1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM I663
Of the inhabited continents of the world,Australasia is the least developed and the most
empty of people. The Aborigines had been build-
ing their lives and culture for millennia when, inthe late eighteenth century, settlement fromBritain began and progressively dispossessed them
of their lands. Regarded as little more than
savages, exploited and treated at best like chil-
dren, they lived an existence that was marginalised
until the third quarter of the twentieth century.Gough Whitlam, the Labor prime minister, in1972 condemned Australian racism: ‘Australia’s
treatment of her Aboriginal people will be the
thing upon which the rest of the world will judge
Australia and Australians – not just now but inthe greater perspective of history.’ But theAborigine voice of protest is not strong enough
to have made much impression on the world.Before the European came there were, accord-ing to rough estimates, between 300,000 and
400,000 Aborigines; by 1961 it was estimatedthat only 40,000 had survived. No one couldjudge their precise numbers because they were
not included in the census before 1967. They
posed no threat to white Australia. The menace
Australians felt came from outside the continent.The geographical position of Australia at the‘edge’ of Asia did much to shape the outlook of
Australians during the twentieth century. Asia,
with its poverty-stricken teeming millions loomed
menacingly over its southern neighbour, with itstiny and comparatively prosperous white popula-
tion of some 7 million in all in 1945, largely ofBritish stock, few of whom inhabited the northern
half. Could Australia survive as a ‘white’ outpost of
civilisation? That was the burning question. ForAustralians a civilised culture was a Western cul-
ture, the preferred ‘race’ people of British descent.In the nineteenth century there had been someChinese immigration and labour had been
brought in from the Paciﬁc islands. The number
of these workers, however, remained small, andthey mostly remained aliens with little defenceagainst deportation. In 1901, immediately after
Australia had ceased to be a colony and become
a self-governing federal commonwealth, signiﬁ-
cantly the issue of paramount concern was immi-gration. The Immigration Act of that year wasenacted to keep out ‘undesirables’; that included
all ‘non-Europeans’, as the ofﬁcial phrase went,
though the immigration programme is better
known as the ‘white Australia’ policy. Even after
large-scale immigration from Britain and Ireland,from 1909 to 1913 and from 1921 to 1925, thepopulation of Australia during the Second World
War had reached only 7 million.Before the Second World War Australia wasstill closely tied to Britain, and not only by com-mon bonds of origin. As a member of the empireand Commonwealth, Australia’s trade in wool and
other rural products enjoyed their main market in
Britain. British industry supplied most of its
imports. For defence, Australia looked to Britaintoo. When Britain went to war in 1914 and 1939,Chapter 60THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM II
AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALANDAustralian volunteer divisions fought side by sidewith the British in Europe and the Middle East.These were distant wars in defence of the mother
country. But the threat of Japan hung over the
Paciﬁc. In June 1940 after the fall of France acable from London to the Australian and NewZealand governments warned them that they
would need to look for protection to the US.
When Japan did enter the war in December 1941,the British nevertheless undertook to defend thekey Singapore naval base. The unexpected and
rapid victories of the Japanese came as a tremen-
dous shock to Australians. The British and Dutchfailed to contain the Japanese advance, and threedays after Pearl Harbor, on 10 December 1941,
two of Britain’s modern battleships, the Repulseand the Prince of Wales, sent to defend Malaya,were sunk from the air. Worse followed. InFebruary 1942, the great defence bastion, the
Singapore naval base, surrendered to the Japanese.
Fifteen thousand Australian troops were takenprisoner. Next the Japanese speedily captured theDutch East Indies (Indonesia). They were now
close to the northern shores of Australia. Darwin
was bombed. Queensland and the NorthernTerritories lay open to invasion.In Australia a mood close to panic ensued.Three seasoned divisions were ﬁghting overseas in
Libya. Two were withdrawn. Plans were made toabandon central and northern Australia, up to the‘Brisbane line’. Now what London had foreshad-
owed came to pass. Australia and New Zealand
were dependent on American protection. Thearrival of General Douglas MacArthur and a con-tingent of US troops, with headquarters in
Melbourne, steadied nerves. African American
GIs were another shock, of a different kind, but
they had to be tolerated while the war lasted. NotBritain now but the US had become the princi-pal Australian ally. Australians made a major mil-
itary contribution. While one division continued
to fight under Montgomery’s command, themain effort was directed to the war in the Paciﬁc.By the time the war came to an end 863,000
Australian troops had been mobilised.The experience of war heightened Australian fearsof the Asian menace from the north. Empty
Australia must be ﬁlled with migrants or Asianswould move in. Immigration had now become amatter of survival. These fears also reinforced the‘white Australia’ immigration policy, which was
racist at heart. The Labor government, in power
since 1941, shaped these racist preconceptions.
Prime Minister Chifley had appointed ArthurCalwell to head a new department of immigra-tion. A propaganda campaign was launched to
overcome Australian fears that substantial immi-
gration would only increase unemployment. The
government played on Australian fears that in the
absence of such migration Asians might overrunthe continent. In Europe, Australia was presentedas a country of sun and freedom where families
could build a new life and prosperity in a society
not riven by class consciousness and prejudice.
Passage for ex-servicemen and their families wasfree; others paid a nominal £10. The assistedmigrants found life hard, especially during the
ﬁrst two years, during which they were housed in
camps and put to work on such huge schemes as
the Snowy Mountain hydroelectric dams.The post-war boom fortunately created labourshortages in Australia. Britain and Ireland were
regarded as the right reservoir for immigrants,
and immigration ofﬁcers were sent secret instruc-
tions to reject applicants of non-European origin;
a Jamaican grandparent in Cardiff would excludea whole family. The immigration ofﬁcers were leftto form a judgement based on the colour of the
skin or such ‘tell-tale signs’ as an oriental slant of
the eyes. Some unfortunate British applicants
were even rejected when they arrived sunburntfrom a Mediterranean holiday. Jews were sepa-rately categorised; like most established immi-

grants, Australian Jewish welfare organisations
were not in favour of allowing unrestricted entry;
however, nearly all the Jews they applied for were
allowed to come; between 1945 and 1954 some17,000 arrived from displaced persons camps. Butthere simply were not enough pale white Britons
to satisfy the enormous demand for migrants.
Calwell ﬂew to Europe to widen the net. Light-
skinned Balts were favoured next. Until the mid-1950s immigration ofﬁcers were instructedto ensure that migrants were of pure ‘Aryan’
descent. The efforts to increase the rate of immi-
gration were a great success. When the supply of1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM II665
pale northern Europeans proved insufﬁcient, thegovernment encouraged, at ﬁrst discreetly, immi-gration from the Mediterranean countries – Italy,
Greece, Yugoslavia, later on Turkey and the
Lebanon – and simply braved the continued prej-
udice in the 1950s and 1960s of the majority ofthe Australian people. Asians, except in smallnumbers, were rigidly excluded, and some of
those who had settled were even deported.With the changing generation came a changein attitudes. Australia could not escape its 
proximity to Asia. From the late 1960s onwards, 
Asian immigration was liberalised. Refugees from
Vietnam were accepted in the early 1970s. A third
of all immigrants now came from Asia. An obses-
sion with assimilating all ‘new Australians’ to
Australian culture and the English language wasreplaced by an acceptance of a multiculturalapproach. Australia’s population would have
increased only slowly but for mass immigration
from Europe and Asia. By 1967 its population 
had reached 12 million and by 1990, 17 million, 
a rate of increase exceeded only by Israel. The 
successful absorption of so many millions, the
weakening of bunkered racial attitudes and greater
tolerance are among the most important achieve-
ments of recent Australian history. Australia
enjoyed, in 2000, the second-highest gross
national product per head of population in Asia
(GNP per head in 2000 was $30,420), beaten
only by Japan with $38,160.The expansion of the Australian economy wasmade possible by the migration, which broughtyoung families and people of working age to manthe factories and the mines and to help build the
country’s infrastructure. The demand for housing,
furniture, cars and other goods is largely met by
Australia’s own manufacturing industry, which
together with mining and services absorbs most 
of its labour, housed in big-city conurbations.
Australian society is obviously no longer pastoral,
but the rest of the world is not so aware that
Australia has fundamentally changed since the
Second World War. Nevertheless, its export trade
is still heavily dependent on primary products –
wool, wheat, minerals, coal, iron and steel – and
on their price ﬂuctuations.Wool no longer held ﬁrst place as an exportearner during the last quarter of the twentiethcentury; coal and iron ore brought in more
dollars. Australia’s prosperity was always depend-
ent on its external trade. Britain had traditionally
been the best market and supplier of capital andmanufactured goods, but long before it joinedthe Common Market on 1 January 1973 the
trend for Australian exports to go to Asia, the US
and the wider world had been well established.
Exports to the US and Canada in 1967 began to
exceed those to Britain, while exports to the restof the European Community almost equalledexports to Britain. But the most startling change
was exports to Japan, which exceeded in value
exports to any other country. A new trading
pattern was being established. Australia aggres-sively sought new markets in the Paciﬁc. Wheatexports went to China, beef to the US. The
south-east Asian nations and Japan accounted for
more than 40 per cent of its exports.The economic miracle in Japan, which beganits take-off in the 1960s, had a huge impact onAustralia. Initially short of coal, iron ore and min-
erals, its mining industry rapidly expanded; vast
new reserves of iron ore were discovered in the
Pilbara region of Western Australia. The indus-
trial development of south-east Asia added to thedemand. During the last quarter of the twentiethcentury prosperous Western Europe has remained
an important market, but Australia’s most import-
ant trading partners are the nations of the Paciﬁc
basin.When Emperor Hirohito died in 1988 ﬂags onofﬁcial buildings in Canberra ﬂew at half-mast.
This token of respect symbolises just one facet of
the transformation of Australia’s relations with 
the rest of the world. It is still an important mem-
ber of the British Commonwealth, the queen of Britain was still queen of Australia in 1992.Australia owes its constitution and legal system 
to Britain, as also its commitment to democracy.
Test matches between the two countries are fol-
lowed avidly by cricket enthusiasts throughout theCommonwealth. Thousands of Australians visitLondon. Family ties persist. But Australia’s future
lies in the Paciﬁc. Fear of Japan has been replaced
by economic interdependence. Japanese invest-666TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
ment, businessmen and technologists are welcomein Australia. Australians can no longer look toBritain to safeguard its security in Asia but must
rely on its own relations with post-colonial Asian
nations, and on its alliance with the US.For more than two decades after the Second WorldWar the US and Britain were Australia’s most
important allies. Together with New Zealand,
Australia concluded the defensive ANZUS alliance
with the US in July 1951. The US was only reluc-

tantly willing to extend its commitments to thesouthern Paciﬁc to meet Australian fears of a resur-
gent Japan, with whom the US was then wishing
to conclude a peace treaty. Britain, although aban-

doning its imperial role in India, was still the mili-

tary shield of its own and Australian interests in theregion, vigorously defending Malaya during thecommunist insurrection in the 1950s. During that
decade aggressive communism was perceived in
Australia as posing as great a threat as Japan had
done in the past.The Cold War, which began in Asia in 1949–50, came to dominate relations in south-east Asia
and Australian foreign policy. The communist
victory in China in 1949 revived fears of millions
of poor Asians expanding south by direct aggres-
sion and subversion. China might repeat Japan’sthrust south – prosperous and underpopulatedAustralia would be a tasty morsel. But it was in
the north Pacific, in Korea, that war actually
broke out in 1950. Australia sent troops to South
Korea to help American and United Nationsforces to halt aggression. Still closer to Australialay Indonesia. Australian leaders after the war had
sought to establish friendly relations with the
newly independent states. Indonesia, after India
and Pakistan, was one of the earliest objects of
this policy, as Australia mediated between theIndonesians and the Dutch.But Indonesian expansion was a worry. Britainin the 1950s and for much of the 1960s was still
the dominant military power in this region. In the
early 1960s after the formation of Malaysia,Australia joined Britain in the confrontation withIndonesia, though it wanted to live on good
terms with the former Dutch colony, whose pop-
ulation dwarfed its own. In 1962 Indonesia andAustralia became neighbours in New Guineawhen Indonesia absorbed West Irian. Until 1968when Britain progressively withdrew from its mil-
itary role ‘east of Suez’, Australia maintained links
with a British and Commonwealth alliance. But
the events of the Second World War had shownthat for Australia’s and New Zealand’s security inAsia the alliance of the US had become more
important, indeed essential.The defeat of France in northern Indo-China in1954 and the Geneva settlement did not bring
peace to the region. Australia became a foundingmember of the South-East Asian Defence Treatywhich, under US leadership, attempted to provide
collective security. Britain and France were mem-

bers too, yet refused to send military help for the
defence of South Vietnam. But successiveAustralian governments accepted the validity of thedomino theory – that communist China was ﬁght-

ing proxy wars to advance communism and that
unless it was halted one state after another would
fall like a row of dominoes. So it was in Australia’sown security interests to provide military help to South Vietnam. It was no less important to
demonstrate to the US that Australia could be
relied on as an ally. But sending conscripts to
Vietnam proved controversial at home. From the
1950s to the 1990s the American alliance hasremained the cornerstone of Australia’s foreignrelations, as the ties that bound Australia to 
Britain weakened. Fear of Japan has long since
been replaced by cooperation. The prosperity of
the region has been hugely promoted by Japan’seconomy and overseas investment in the non-communist nations of south-east Asia. In the
1990s Japan has emerged not just as the most
important bulwark against communism, but its
successful example is undermining the ideology of
central planners in the remaining Asian communistnations.Australian politics at home revolved around threeparties, the Australian Labor Party, the Country
Party and the Liberal Party, but in practice a two-party system operated, with the Country andLiberal Parties forming coalition administrations.
Each party itself represented various interests 
and views. The Labor Party, founded by trade1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM II667
unionists, fought to improve conditions for thepoorer section of the population by means of leg-islation, but in practice it was not a Marxist–
socialist party and supported a privately owned,
free-enterprise economy with a minimum of state
ﬁnancial controls. At state and federal level the dif-ferences between the parties were more a matterof personalities, emphasis and attitudes than any-
thing profoundly ideological. Labor’s long period
in opposition from 1949 to 1972 increased fac-
tional tensions within the party, but it achieved 
a sustained period in ofﬁce from 1972 to 1975and after 1983. The Country Party has its base inthe rural areas and represents the farmers and 
their special interests. Vehemently anti-socialist, it
is a minority party but as coalition partner of the
Liberal Party its inﬂuence has been greater than its numbers. The Liberal Party too is largely con-servative, reluctant to extend welfare and keen 
to prevent the trade unions from exerting too
much inﬂuence. A small Communist Party has its
strongest support among some trade unionists.On the whole, Australian politics revolves lessaround ideologies than around the appeal of indi-
vidual politicians and special-interest groups.As prime minister, John Curtin led a Laborgovernment which earned Australia’s gratitude for
the successful prosecution of the Second WorldWar. Welfare provisions were modestly extendedand Canberra’s federal muscle in policy making
was greatly strengthened in 1942 by taking over
from the states the sole right of imposing income
tax. The states remained jealous of their consti-tutional rights and the tug of war between themand the federal government continued as a recur-
ring feature of post-war Australian politics.As early as December 1942 Curtin’s govern-
ment made plans for a better post-war Australia,
setting up a department of post-war reconstruc-
tion. The guiding inspiration was more Roosevelt’sNew Deal and Keynes than socialist doctrine. Able
young economists worked on a masterplan under
Ben Chifley, the minister responsible. It was
Chiﬂey who on Curtin’s death in 1945 becameprime minister. What haunted Australians, as ithaunted the rest of the Western world, was the
prospect of a return to the 1930s and mass unem-

ployment. So planning was undertaken in relationto housing, farming, industry and training.Australians were to be assured that they wouldhave work and adequate housing for the family.
The extension of welfare provision was more mod-

est: pensions for widows were granted, but persis-

tent efforts to extend state cover against illness,even the minimal proposals for free medicines, fellfoul of the powerful medical lobby, which fought
tooth and nail against any form of ‘socialised medi-
cine’ and which especially abhorred the model of
Britain’s National Health Service, the most
important achievement of Britain’s post-warLabour government.Ben Chiﬂey’s attempts to extend welfare bene-
ﬁts and to maintain in peacetime the federal pow-

ers Canberra had secured in war were challenged
by the states, whose claims were generally support-ed by a conservative High Court. The most impor-tant of Chiﬂey’s reforms was to secure government
control over monetary policy by nationalising
Australia’s central bank, the Commonwealth Bank,
in 1945, though an unpopular and unnecessaryattempt to extend control over all private bankswas eventually struck down by the High Court.
Conditions were favourable for the Australian
economy in the post-war years, there being a high
demand for its wool, meat and wheat, which
ensured good prices, growing prosperity andlabour shortages. Chiﬂey’s sound ﬁnancial man-
agement and limited federal engagement in indus-

try left the bulk of the Australian economy in
private hands. Unlike the British Labour Party, the
Australian Labor Party was ready to work with andproﬁt from private enterprise, attempting only toregulate the market and rejecting nationalisation.Chiﬂey’s Labor Government would have notruck either with militant trade unionism, which
was now recovering after the hardship and
exploitation of working men before the war.Strikes were blamed on the communists, and theopposition tried to tar Chiﬂey’s cautious and prag-
matic administration with this brush. But the
prime minister continued to insist that settlement
of trade union demands should be reachedthrough the Arbitration Court, which he refusedto dismantle. The Arbitration Court was conserv-
ative, as was clearly shown for instance in its rejec-
tion of equal pay for women in 1950, but granted668TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
basic wage demands and the forty-hour weekwhich the trade unions had fought for. Chiﬂey didnot hesitate to take tough measures against unions
that went on strike. The most serious of these
stoppages was the miners’ strike in the summer of
1949. With the country threatened with paralysis,troops were sent in to reopen the coal mines andthe miners were forced back, winning only some
of their claims. The general inﬂuence of commu-
nists in the trade union movement receded,
though it was strongest among the miners after
the unsuccessful 1949 strike, but obsession with anon-existent communist threat remained a featureof Australian politics for years to come.In December 1949 Australians felt secureenough to vote the Labor government out of
ofﬁce. Robert Menzies, who had led the Liberal–Country Party opposition, promised prosperityand a better life free of bureaucratic control. Like
the Conservatives in Britain in 1945, where the
tactic had misﬁred, he now warned against totali-

tarian socialism. There was no such danger ofcourse, but the electorate was ready for a swing ofthe pendulum. Menzies, who soon became one of
the best-known politicians on the world stage, had
founded the Liberal Party and rebuilt the opposi-

tion during the war. He was a moderate conserva-

tive, appealing for consensus, an Australian versionperhaps of Stanley Baldwin, a middle-of-the-roader with a common touch, standing for decency
and family values and fulminating against commu-

nism and trade unions, especially when they went
on strike. Later his staunch support of British roy-
alty and his deference to and affection for theyoung Queen Elizabeth II appeared to reinforce
the old traditional Britishness and dependence of
Australia. But behind the avuncular image lurked a
shrewd politician.His government made no great changes fromLabor’s previous policies. Some welfare provisionswere improved; more was done to pay for health
care, in the teeth of the suspicious medical pro-
fession. Although Australia was in no danger of
being subverted by communism, Menziesattempted to stir up feelings against the smallCommunist Party and in 1950 legislated to
outlaw it and seize its assets. It is to the credit of
the Australian High Court’s sense of democraticvalues that it struck this measure down by amajority decision; the Australian people them-
selves rejected it, but only by a tiny margin, when
in 1951 Menzies campaigned to outlaw the party
in a national referendum.Menzies dominated Australian politics in the1950s and 1960s. These were the golden years ofexpansion and continuous improvement in the
standard of living. More than 2 million immi-
grants were successfully absorbed. The black spot
was the continued neglect of Aborigine interests.
They had little share in Australia’s boom. As far aswhite Australia was concerned there seemed noneed to take risks by turning to Labor, whose poli-
cies were no more hostile to the capitalist basis of
the Australian economy than the Menzies-led
government. The Liberal–Country Party coalitionwas therefore able to stay in ofﬁce for most of thethree decades up to the 1980s. Prosperity had
eroded working-class support. Condemned to
almost virtual opposition Labor became faction-
alised. Can parliamentary democracy really survivein such conditions? Reassuringly it did. Labor didwin power in a number of state governments. In
1966 Menzies retired after serving continuously as
prime minister for sixteen years. His one enduring
domestic achievement, apart from presiding prag-
matically over Australia’s years of prosperity, wasthe giving of government support for school anduniversity education, which greatly expanded. The
timing of his departure was well judged, as more
difﬁcult economic times lay ahead, and a new
generation of Australians prepared to face them.Most Australians remained resolutely anti-communist, but the challenge from the younger
generation, which swept the Western world in 
the mid-1960s, did not entirely pass Australia by.
The Vietnam War gave the discontent a focus.
Demonstrations were mounted against thesupport that successive governments gave to theUS from 1966 to 1971 under Harold Holt, John
Gorton and William McMahon, the three prime
ministers who followed Menzies. They were pre-
cursors of a shift in Australian political loyaltiesafter twenty-three years of Liberal–Country Partydomination. Industrial disputes became more fre-
quent. The Labor Party drew new hope from
these conditions, which many Australians blamed1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM II669
on the Liberal–Country Party’s political elite, justat a time when Labor had at last found a resource-ful new leader with national appeal and charisma
in Gough Whitlam.In December 1972 a majority of Australiansvoted Labor to power and Gough Whitlambecame Australia’s first Labor prime ministersince 1949. That vote for Labor was a signal for
a fresh start, for new faces, but not for socialism.
Australia would remain an economy of free enter-
prise where the few could amass large fortunes.
Whitlam had not risen from the ranks of theworking man. University educated, a lawyer bytraining, a politician by profession, he relished
power and did not go out of his way to avoid
confrontations and antagonism. He regarded
Labor’s victory as a mandate for social change andpromised to bring it about with an immediateburst of activity, as Franklin D. Roosevelt had
done in the early weeks of the New Deal. God
had taken seven days to create the world; Whitlam
reshaped Australian politics in fourteen. The listof decisions taken and promises given was star-tling: Aborigines were promised better treatment,
Papua New Guinea was given independence,
national service was ended, Vietnam draft default-
ers were pardoned, a stand was taken against
racism in the Commonwealth, communist Chinawas recognised, and plans were drawn up forcloser supervision of manufacturing industry.During the ﬁrst two years the Labor govern-
ment’s main goal was to reduce the inequalities of
opportunity suffered by the less well-off Australian– migrant, worker or professional; white, brown orblack. The great leveller was education, and better
schools for the disadvantaged and universities open
to students on merit were among Labor’s achieve-

ments. Another was the legislation creating a uni-

versal insurance-based health service. Labor’sconcern for the poor was also reﬂected in the
expansion of the social services. It all cost money,
and inﬂation could not forever delay the day of
reckoning. Labor’s fortunes declined in 1974. The
economy had been hit by the world economic cri-
sis that followed the ending of the Vietnam Warand the oil-price rise. Inﬂation and unemployment

were rising. The measures taken to curb inﬂation

were bound to be unpopular. Financial ineptitudeand scandals, and unemployment reaching 5 percent, cast Labor’s management of the economy ina bad light. The anti-Labor press made the most of
these difﬁculties.The Labor government came to a dramaticend in November 1975. The leader of the oppo-sition, Malcolm Fraser, assembled enough votesto deny passage of the Budget, justifying this by
accusing the government of ﬁnancial mismanage-
ment. At the height of the constitutional crisis,
the governor-general Sir John Kerr, who as 
representative of the queen held a ceremonialappointment with theoretical powers, chose actu-ally to use them and, acting insensitively and
high-handedly, dismissed Whitlam from the pre-
miership. Whitlam accepted his dismissal and gave
Fraser the task of forming a caretaker governmentuntil new elections to be held in Decembershould decide the issue. When Australia voted
there was less concern for the constitutionality of
the dismissal than for the country’s economic
prospects, which were grim. It seemed safer to amajority of Australians to return to power theLiberal–National (formerly Country) Party. Labor
had been unlucky to hold power during what had
been difficult years throughout the Western
world. Whichever party had been in ofﬁce would
probably have been voted out. But, for all its mis-takes, the Labor government’s aims of greatersocial justice and racial harmony foreshadowed a
return to these aspirations when Labor regained
power in 1983 and this time stayed in govern-
ment for more than a decade.The Liberal–National coalition headed byMalcolm Fraser took up the reins of the admin-
istration again after the short and eventful Labor
intermission. There was nothing startling about
the next seven years of moderate conservative
government. Where Whitlam had stood some-what left of centre, Fraser was not too far to theright of centre. The trade unions were conve-
niently blamed for economic ills. When the world
recession eased, Australian exports, which were so
dependent on international economic health,recovered. Fraser was more conciliatory than hispredecessor had been towards state rights and
their relations with the federal government in
Canberra.670TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
Australian society had steadily become morepolarised. Many Australians, particularly the pro-
fessional classes, enjoyed a high standard of living.
But working people during the 1970s had made
less progress and more than one Australian in every
six was classiﬁed early in that decade as living inpoverty or close to it. Fraser’s economic policy wasorthodox. Despite increasing unemployment,
social beneﬁt expenditure did not rise. A backward
step was the dismantling of Whitlam’s health care
provision, Medibank, and its abolition in 1981;
free medical provision was restricted to the poor,who qualiﬁed by a means test or as senior citizens.In March 1983 Fraser’s Liberal–National coalition
lost the general election and a Labor government
was once more returned to power.Robert Hawke, who dominated Australianpolitics as Labor’s dynamic and colourful leaderfor the remainder of the 1980s, was academically
well qualiﬁed and had won his spurs in Australian
politics as a research ofﬁcer for the Australian
Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) thirty yearsearlier. Bob Hawke had been an active and skilfuladvocate on behalf of ACTU and, eventually, its
president. He entered the House of Representa-
tives in 1980, determined to gain the leadership
of the Labor Party.Hawke’s period in ofﬁce was marked by con-ciliation with the business community on the onehand, and trade union moderation on the other.
He wanted all sides of industry to work together,
with the federal government playing the role of
benevolent third party. This time Labor was luckyin the timing of its victory. The mid-1980s wereyears of unprecedented world economic boom.
Australia did well out of it. There was nothing
radical or socialist about Hawke. He used to good
advantage his trade union experience of negotiat-
ing and balancing opposing sides, in this wayholding the Labor Party together and resisting itstendency to split into left and right wings. Nor
was there any great move to beneﬁt the poorest
section of Australians by extending and increas-
ing social beneﬁts, except in the area of healthcare. A national health scheme providing univer-sal beneﬁt had become something of a political
football in Australia, with the Australian Medical
Association ﬁghting a ﬁerce rearguard action overthe decades. Hawke’s administration resurrectedWhitlam’s Medibank, now called Medicare, andAustralia’s doctors acquiesced. But the Labor
government did not engage in a spending spree
or impose high taxation policies, and in this
Hawke was loyally and ably supported by his min-isterial colleague Paul Keating. But the privatesector and state governments were running up
large debts. Most political excitement during
these years was caused by Hawke’s efforts to 
rid Australian politics of corruption. Australians
approved of his undoctrinaire approach, hisfriendly relations with business and the apparentstability of the economy, which was expanding
with the inﬂux of foreign capital. The price was
paid later in recession and spectacular business
failures. Hawke won the two elections of 1984and 1987, his expansive personality and self-confident espousal of an Australian identity
making him for a time the most popular prime
minister in the country’s history. He presided
over the bicentenary in 1988, a ﬁtting celebrationof an Australia reaching maturity.But the festivities also became a reminder that onegroup of Australians, its oldest settlers, the
Aborigines, had not shared equally in that wealth,
and that their grievances had not yet been ade-
quately addressed. The early settlers of the lateeighteenth century had been instructed to deal
with the Aborigines as a whole, leaving them ‘in
the full enjoyment of their possessions’. But the
benevolent intentions of the sovereign’s govern-
ment in London thousands of miles away did notmake much impression on pioneers engaged in the
hard task of making a living out of what appeared
to them to be empty lands. State governments’
efforts in Australia and missionary endeavours
could do little to alleviate the disastrous impact ofWestern lifestyles on the culture and way of life ofthe exploited Aborigines. After the Second World
War the Aborigines began to organise themselves,
demanding citizens’ rights and better wages. In
1957 the Northern Territory admitted mixed-raceAborigines and full Aborigines who could lookafter themselves to citizenship. Aborigines were
regarded as civilised if they assimilated to white
Australian culture – assimilation was the welfare1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM II671
aim. The ‘white Australian’ policy in practice hadthe effect of demoralising them.Only slowly, beginning in the 1960s, didAborigines win equal rights. An Aborigine lead-
ership emerged able to organise effective protest
movements and focus demands on wage issues,discrimination and land rights. Gough Whitlam,when he came to power in December 1972,
broke with tradition by paying attention to the
needs of the Aborigines, promising schools for
them and the protection of their land rights
against mining companies that wished to exploitthe mineral wealth below. The companies’ desireto extend exploration in this way pitted proﬁt,
national production and wealth against the rights
of the Aborigines. The following year another
well-intentioned effort led to the establishment ofa National Aboriginal Consultative Committee.The improvement in Aborigine welfare has
brought abuses into even sharper relief.Discrimination remained rife in Australia in theearly 1990s. The Aborigines, denied good healthcare, housing and education, were trapped; highunemployment added to their misery, to the
problems of crime and alcohol abuse. Australians
were shocked by a report that more than a
hundred Aborigines had died locked up in police
cells since 1980. As recently as 1992 one of thecommissioners investigating these deaths found itnecessary to say, ‘We as a community have to
change our attitude toward Aborigines. We have
to recognise them as a distinct people who were
dispossessed of this continent and deal with themwith respect.’ Racism could not be obliteratedovernight. But white Australia was not alone in
confronting what in the 1990s was now one of
the major causes of war and bloodshed elsewhere
in the world. The task of raising the standards 
of a minority who had for decades lived in orclose to destitution was a formidable one. TheAustralian Labor government in 1992 unveiled
another scheme to improve the educational,
housing and health provisions for Aborigines and,
above all, to ensure better treatment by the policeand courts. White Australians would be obligedto consult with representatives of Aborigine
groups about measures and actions that affected
them.The boom of the 1980s began to overheat in1988. But despite economic worries Bob Hawkeled Labor to a fourth successive victory in federal
elections in 1990. Labor had been following a
market-economy philosophy, reducing protection
for Australia’s industries, raising interest rates andstriving to keep money supply under control. Hitby a recession that showed no sign of lifting, and
faced with another election in 1993, the Labor
Party changed its leader in December 1991. Bob
Hawke was dropped and his long-time treasurer
(ﬁnance minister) and political rival Paul Keatingbecame prime minister. Far from changing direc-tion, Keating announced the government would
move with even greater determination to make
industry more efﬁcient, abolish tariffs and help
business with tax breaks, while keeping govern-ment expenditure under tight control.In the early 1990s Australia suffered badly fromthe recession in the West, with an unemployment
rate of 10 per cent. The growth of the south-east
Asian economies of Indonesia, Thailand andMalaysia did not provide an immediate cure tounemployment as Australian business increasingly
relocated industry where the markets were and
where labour was cheap. In March 1993 Keating
narrowly won another term for Labor against the
expectation of many observers that the severerecession would cripple his chances of re-election.By the 1990s Australia was a sophisticated cos-mopolitan culture. With more than 30,000 mil-
lionaires it was hardly classless, but ‘class’ had
hitherto been based on the wealth of the self-made man, not on birth to high station. But thatwould change as wealth was inherited. The
Australians were conscious of great changes to
come. Industry and industrial exports would have
to play an ever increasing role in the economy.
The traditional export markets of Europe and theUS retained their importance but the new, rapidlyexpanding markets lay in Asia, where nearly half of
Australia’s exports now went. Australia could no
longer afford to ‘ﬁght against the reality of its own
geography’, to quote Gareth Evans, Australia’sdynamic foreign minister. Japan was the model foreffective, advanced industrial organisation. Yet
Australia is not an Asian country: the majority of
its people are of European origin, and its majority672TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
culture and way of life and its democratic form ofgovernment are Western. In the 1990s it wasbeing inexorably drawn closer into Asia yet
remained apart. Although the ‘white Australia’
immigration policy was abandoned in the mid-
1970s, Asian resentment of Australian racism hadnot disappeared. Nor was the multiracial Australiauniversally accepted by Australians. No wonder
that the national identity and future of Australia
were hotly debated.The elections of March 1996 brought aLiberal–National coalition back to power and JohnHoward became prime minister, having to cope
with Australia in recession. The conservative gov-

ernment passed tax reforms, privatised state indus-

tries and faced a tide of racist anti-multiculturismwhich had, for a long time, brought to prominencea new One Nation Party led by Pauline Hanson
directed against Asian immigration and the expan-

sion of the rights of Aborigines. The government
was struggling to bring into operation the NativeTitle Acts passed in 1993 which recognised thatthe interests and rights of the native people had
not been superseded. The basic issue was whether
pastoral leases on Crown land had expunged
Aboriginal land rights, land important in
Queensland Western Australia with mining inter-
ests. In 1995 the High Court conﬁrmed that the
federal government, in applying the Native Title
Acts, could override state governments. The strug-

gle was not over. The amended Act of 1998 was
designed to make it ‘more workable’. Between1994 and 1998 1,200 native title agreements werereached between indigenous groups, pastoralists,
miners, industry and the government. The govern-

ment also acted on a shocking revelation that
Aboriginal children had been forcibly removed
from their parents during the years from the 1880s until as recently as the 1960s. The govern-
ment offered monetary compensation, but John
Howard refused a collective apology for the ‘stolen
generation’. Aborigine activists remained dissatis-

ﬁed with government compromises.In foreign affairs, Australia’s relations with thePaciﬁc countries deteriorated. John Howard was
opposed to the inﬂux of refugees from the trouble
spots of Indonesia and East Timor which threat-ened to descend into anarchy and bloodshed.Helping the UN to restore order was a notableachievement. By the time of the November 2001
election the granting of asylum to refugees had
become the big issue. John Howard earlier that
year had been expected to lose the election toLabor. His high proﬁle uncompromising stand onrefugees brought him the support he needed to
meet the challenge of the Australian Labor Party.
In August 2001, 430 wretched Afghan refugees
were stranded offshore and prevented from
landing. They were eventually sent to a detentioncamp in the South Pacific paid for by theAustralian government. In the election the coali-
tion was able to retain ofﬁce, the Australian Labor
Party had secured marginally more votes but the
National Party swung the balance. John Howardcontinued as prime minister in the new millen-nium. One issue likely to be revived is whether
Australia should become a republic severing the
link with the Crown. A referendum hotly fought
in 1999 rejected a change to a republic, but theresignation of the governor-general appointed bythe queen on the advice of the Australian prime
minister raised what many Australians continued
to see as an outworn anomaly.Not Sweden, but a small and remote Britishcolony in the South Paciﬁc, New Zealand, canmake a good claim to being the precursor of the
welfare state. Since its foundations in the 1890s
when a Liberal government came to power and
passed welfare legislation, benevolent interventionby the state to protect the poorer and weaker inthe community was a persistent feature of politics,
whichever party was in power, at least until the
early 1990s, through both good times and bad.The Liberals, in power for twenty-one years(1891–1912), were radical reformers. Compulsoryarbitration of labour disputes introduced in 1894protected what were at that time weak trade
unions. A year earlier women had been enfran-

chised. In 1898 New Zealand pioneered the old-
age pension. The Liberals believed in democracyand what in later times would be called ‘social jus-
tice’. They accepted capitalism, that is private own-

ership and the market, and had no socialist
aspirations, but wished to use the power of the1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM II673
state to curb the exploitation of the weak. Theirideal was a more egalitarian society. But in theprocess the national government also greatly
increased its own power. Early in the century some
of the main lines of political development were set.The Liberals aimed at a harmonious nationalconsensus, between country and town, worker andemployer, farmer and businessman. They suc-

ceeded for a long period but sectional interests in
the end destroyed the aim though not the reforms
the Liberals had enacted. The increase in the num-

ber of urban workers stimulated the formation of adistinct Labour Party more narrowly identiﬁed
with their interests, and the trade unions grew
more militant. Largely based on the dairy farmers,
a more conservative opposition, the Reform Party,
evolved. Between 1912 and 1935 no one of thethree parties had a clear lead over the others. The1920s were a period of general depression, with
falling prices for New Zealand’s farm produce. The
depression of the early 1930s was even worse. New
Zealand was utterly dependent on world prices forits exports, and Britain, its main market, was deeplydepressed. Even so the early Labour Party’s social-

ist programme could not hope to ﬁnd sufﬁcient

support to make Labour the governing party. The
great majority of New Zealanders had no truck
with Marxist socialism or the abolition of propertyrights. On the contrary, they aspired to a higherstandard of living and to owning their own land
and home. The New Zealand Labour Party there-

fore accepted socialism in theory but not in prac-

tice. These were the politics of the white NewZealand settlers. But what of the original indigen-
ous New Zealanders, the Maoris?The early impact of the European was cata-
strophic, as it was on the indigenous peoples of the
Americas. The new settlers sometimes acquired
land by fair means but more usually they did so byfoul. As their numbers increased so did the pres-
sure on Maori land. European settlers disrupted
traditional societies. Worst of all, they introduced
new diseases against which the indigenous people
had no defence. When the Europeans ﬁrst settled
it is estimated that there were about 200,000Maoris in New Zealand, mostly inhabiting North
Island, which was divided by warring tribes.
Possession of land by the tribe was the mostimportant indication of status – and it belonged tothe community as a whole and not to individuals.In the nineteenth century, dispute over land led to
violent conﬂict with the settlers, the Maori wars.
Some 2,000 Maoris lost their lives. The rapid
decline of the Maori population to 42,000 by theturn of the century was, however, due more to dis-
ease and the disruption of their traditional culture
and lives than to war.Far away in distant London the intention of governments towards indigenous peoples 
had been benevolent. Unlike the Aborigines ofAustralia, the Maoris had even received guaran-tees by treaty intended to preserve their rights.
That compact was the Treaty of Waitangi in
1840, by which Maori chiefs ceded New Zealand
to the British Crown and in return were guaran-teed possession of their lands, forests and ﬁsheriesand granted the rights and privileges of British
subjects. This gave the Maoris a solid legal basis
for demanding the righting of wrongful seizures,
which has persisted to the present day. In the rela-tions between the white settlers and their descen-dants and the Maori people this treaty is a crucial
contract, though its interpretation in contempor-
ary conditions is certainly complex. The Maoris
thus attained rights in the nineteenth century not
enjoyed by the Aborigines until late in the twen-tieth century. They were also granted separateelectorates and four members of parliament in
1867. Later in the twentieth century, to preserve
their sense of identity, Maoris as well as descen-
dants of mixed race who wished to be identiﬁedas Maori could be entered on the Maori electoralroll on request.The Maoris began to recover only in the twen-tieth century after they had lost or sold most of
their lands. A leadership educated in an Anglican
school for Maoris began to emerge early in thecentury and a modest measure of local self-government was granted before the First World
War. The Maori population recovered slowly. By
1921 it numbered 56,000. Their cultural identity
was now greatly strengthened by the establish-ment of a distinct Maori religious cult, the RatanaChurch, founded by Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana,
who had had a vision in 1918. Ratana disciples
captured all the Maori political seats in parliament674TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
and formed an alliance with Labour. WhenLabour came to power in 1935 it began a pro-gramme of Maori welfare campaigns in education,
social entitlements and land settlement.By 1946, the Maori population had increasedto about 100,000 and it had doubled a genera-
tion later (1966) to over 200,000; by then abouthalf the Maoris lived in urban areas. White New
Zealand no longer aimed to assimilate them. 
New Zealand had become a multicultural society.Racial discrimination lessened and was replaced bya renaissance of interest in Maori culture. Maori
achievements in battle during the Second World
War and on the rugby ﬁeld became a matter ofpride for all New Zealanders. Discriminationremains, however – not on grounds of colour but
because of the lower educational attainments of
the Maori people. This places Maoris at a severedisadvantage and their unemployment in times ofrecession is much higher than that of white New
Zealanders.From 1935 to 1949 New Zealand politicsregained stability with the Labour Party in power.
The party had shed much of its theoretical social-
ism and now appealed to sections of the middleclasses as well as to working people; it also guar-anteed prices for farm produce. Labour wished to
protect the farmers and manufacturers by insu-
lating New Zealand from its dependence on worldprice ﬂuctuations through greater state control ofmarketing and distribution. It also followed the
earlier humanitarian tradition of the Liberals in
extending welfare safeguards for the poor. TheLabour government led by Michael Joseph Savagewas an able one and was lucky to come to power
as world economic conditions began to improve.
It created the modern welfare state. Workers weresafeguarded by a minimum wage, but trade unionpower was limited by the reintroduction of com-
pulsory arbitration for industrial disputes; public
works programmes on the model of the New Deal
were implemented; unemployment was reduced;pensions were increased. The Social Security Actof 1938 was also notable for starting a national
health service with virtually free treatment and
medicines a decade before Britain did so. In1945–6 a second burst of legislative energy pro-vided child beneﬁts without a means test for everyfamily. New Zealand thus created an integratedand comprehensive social-security system thatabolished fears of extreme poverty and included
white New Zealanders and Maoris alike. The con-
trast between New Zealand’s social policies andAustralia’s treatment of the Aborigines at thetime, and Australia’s bitter battles over health ser-
vices, is striking. But social provisions had to be
paid for by a relatively high level of taxation. NewZealanders could afford their welfare state duringthe post-war decades because there was great
demand for their farm products – beef, lamb and
dairy produce.The opposition, the Reform Party and the oldLiberal Party, combined to form the National
Party. Like Labour it accepted the welfare-state
provisions – indeed, in outlook it no longer differed
markedly from Labour, except insofar as it empha-

sised reduced state intervention and the importanceof individual enterprise. New Zealand’s most distinguished historian, Keith Sinclair, described
both the Labour and National Parties post-war as
‘conservative’. This remained true for Labour in 
the 1980s.In the 1949 general election the NationalParty won power, promising to end unnecessary
socialist controls and to follow policies more in
New Zealand’s interests than the internationalism
of Labour had been. Sidney George Hollandbecame prime minister. By this time, Cold Warhysteria had spread to New Zealand. The gov-
ernment defeated the more militant unions,
which were accused of fomenting unrest in
Russia’s cause. The National Party won election
after election. New Zealanders were well satisﬁed,prospering from the post-war economic boom.Sid Holland anticipated British conservative
politics in enabling tenants to purchase on
favourable terms their publicly owned (state)
houses. But control over the marketing wasretained to ensure more stable prices. In 1957Holland was replaced by Keith Holyoake. The
general election gave Labour a narrow victory,
only for the party to preside over three difﬁcult
economic years, 1957–60. In consequence the
government had to raise taxes and was punishedby defeat at the next election. Keith Holyoake,returned to power, led a government determined1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM II675
to carry on the reforming tradition: capital pun-ishment was abolished; an ombudsman wasappointed who could adjudicate where aggrieved
citizens had complaints against government de-
partments; compensation for accidents and equal
pay for men and women were introduced.Another Labour administration in 1972 had tocope with the worry about New Zealand’s future
exports now that Britain was joining the European
Economic Community, though transitional ar-rangements cushioned the blow. Meat and butterwere still the major exports. Diversiﬁcation of
markets and the development of non-primary
products became ever more urgent. By the mid-1970s markets had diversiﬁed and the Japanese
imported from New Zealand almost as much in
value as Britain. While only a minority of the work-

force was needed for farming, and industry hadgreatly expanded in petroleum products, paper,wood, plastics, chemicals, iron and steel and
machinery, New Zealand was still dependent on
exports of meat and dairy products to pay for itsimports. Therefore, it relied on its earnings fromfarming and on the low cost of imports. But the
former dropped and the latter rose, plunging New
Zealand into severe economic difﬁculties in the
1970s, especially after the rise in the cost of oil.The golden years of afﬂuence were over.
The electorate was fairly evenly divided betweenNational and Labour during the unsettled 1970s.
In 1975 Robert Muldoon became prime ministerwhen the National Party won the general electionand he and his party just managed to gain more
seats in parliament for him to retain the premier-

ship after elections in 1978 and 1981. Electionswere decided by the state of the economy and bypromises to lead New Zealand back to prosperity.
Muldoon was a robust political leader, inclined to
berate the opposition. But in the one area of gov-
ernment dear to all New Zealanders, social welfare,he legislated the most generous retirement provi-

sions in his country’s history. The economic con-

dition of New Zealand was grim in the 1980s, withunemployment and inﬂation rising.
New Zealand is divided from Australia by 1,300miles of sea, but by the 1990s relations between
the two former British dependencies had becomeincreasingly close. No other Western developedcountry may be reached after a few hours’ airtravel. In their white pioneering phase, bothcountries had faced similar problems. Yet their
development has been distinctive in the twentieth
century, and the New Zealander takes pride in the
differences.Economically New Zealand’s mineral andpetroleum resources were of limited signiﬁcance.
Unlike Australia, it was overwhelmingly depend-
ent on agriculture for exports. But in one respect
the two countries confronted a common concern
in the twentieth century. They were countrieswith small populations in relation to the millionsof Asians to the north. To safeguard their secu-
rity both countries felt the need for a powerful
ally. As part of the empire and Commonwealth it
was Britain on whom they could rely. As long asBritain still ruled the waves, they would be safe.Reciprocal feeling of kinship and support played
a part, and New Zealanders (no less than
Australians) fought with Britain in both world
wars in Europe and in the Middle East.After the fall of Singapore in 1942, NewZealand did not bring the bulk of its troops home
from Europe and the Middle East. The threat of
Japan now loomed large, but Britain could spare
no forces. It was a portent for the future when a
US marine division of 20,000 men was stationed inNew Zealand. The US was seen to be protectingthe Dominion.In 1944, New Zealand and Australia formedtheir own regional mutual security alliance, the
Canberra Pact, since they could no longer rely onthe defence link provided by Britain before thewar. When the war was over, the US became New
Zealand’s principal ally, as it was Australia’s. But
the Americans had been willing to extend their
commitment to the South Paciﬁc only after the
Cold War had broken out in Asia. The USresolved to rebuild Japan and concluded the tri-partite ANZUS defence treaty in September 1951
to allay Australian and New Zealand fears of a
Japanese resurgence and of Asian communism.
Excluded from ANZUS, Britain – with NewZealand – joined SEATO. New Zealand sentforces to defend Malaysia in the confrontation
with Indonesia, and a token force in the 1960s to
Vietnam. New Zealand was showing loyalty to676TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949
both allies, the US and Britain. But there was lit-tle doubt which was the more important. From1966 to 1976 Britain progressively withdrew 
from its responsibilities ‘east of Suez’. ANZUS
remained the sheet anchor of New Zealand’s and
Australia’s defence policies. In New Zealand thiswas to change dramatically only in the mid-1980s.The Labour government, which came to powerafter the landslide victory of 1984, set to with a will
to cure New Zealand’s economic problems with
Thatcherite fervour. The identiﬁcation of Labour

in New Zealand with politics of the left is quiteinappropriate. The consensus over welfare legisla-
tion remained intact, as it did in Conservative-
governed Britain. What Labour set out to do was
to make New Zealand more competitive – deregu-

lating, removing subsidies and tariffs, turning stateenterprises into corporations and raising new taxes.At the same time a tight monetary policy was fol-

lowed. Unemployment increased and the standard
of living began to drop. But the electorate trusted
the government’s harsh remedies, believing therewas no other way. Labour was re-elected in 1987,despite the hardship the restructuring was causing
to many New Zealanders.Prime Minister David Lange’s forceful conductof New Zealand’s relations with powerful nations
gained popularity and compensated to some extentfor problems at home. New Zealand would not bepushed around. Lange rightly discerned that the
old Cold War mentality was outdated. Nuclear
testing in the Paciﬁc by the French had been

widely condemned. Labour had made an electionpledge in 1984 to ban nuclear-powered warships.Lange’s government saw no future in a nuclear
defence of New Zealand that would destroy the
Dominion. But in American eyes the nuclear
deterrent was the only credible means of defence.
The temperature of the nuclear controversy wasraised to fever pitch in New Zealand when in July1985 French secret agents sank Greenpeace’s ship
Rainbow Warriorin Auckland harbour just as itwas preparing to set sail for the French nuclear
testing site; one crewman was killed, and twoFrench agents were captured. Later a US nuclearwarship was refused permission to visit New
Zealand. For Washington this was a test case.
When the Lange government would not relent,the US responded by declaring that it no longerfelt bound by the ANZUS commitment to defendNew Zealand. Fortunately, with the world changes
taking place, the need to defend New Zealand
from any hostile nation became ever more remote.In the 1990s New Zealand’s future was boundup with its foreign relations and trade in thePaciﬁc basin. The European Community, includ-
ing Britain, remained an important market for its
agricultural produce, but its largest trading part-
ners were Australia, Japan and the US. The Paciﬁc
now accounted for three-quarters of its trade.Although the economic remedies were not liftingNew Zealand out of recession, the government
did not alter the main thrust of its policies. In
1989 David Lange gave up the premiership, but
this did nothing to aid Labour’s popularity. Theelectorate had suffered enough pain, and no ben-eﬁts were in sight. During the election of 1990,
many people supported third parties in their dis-
illusionment. This allowed Jim Bolger to lead a
National government.Bolger’s main policy was to continue deregula-tion. In an attempt to alleviate unemployment, his
government repealed those measures that pro-

tected wages and trade union rights. The consen-
sus over welfare support was broken. Universal
family beneﬁts were abolished and cuts in otherwelfare programmes were made. The governmentsucceeded in reducing inﬂation in 1991 to just
over 2 per cent. The cost – over 10 per cent unem-
ployment – was high. The rich had got richer and
the poor were poorer, with the Maoris, lacking thewhites’ standards of education, now at the bottomof the unemployment heap. The ideal of an egali-
tarian society had long ago vanished. The govern-
ment responded to the country’s economic ills by
slashing welfare further. But the New Zealand
economy in the early 1990s failed to respond tothese drastic changes. In conditions of prolongeddepression the real danger lay in the electorate
despairing of their politicians altogether.New Zealanders are pioneers. They pioneeredthe welfare state. In the early 1990s they were pio-
neering the most radical U-turn away from thewelfare state, with the intention as the government
saw it of weaning the people off the expectation of
automatic handouts. Trade union power was1THE PROSPEROUS PACIFIC RIM II677
weakened by the ending of the closed shop andcentralised wage bargaining; trade union protest in1992 was faced down by Bolger’s government.
Publicly owned industries were privatised or
turned into corporations, and the ﬁnancial sector

was deregulated. Protected markets of farmers andmanufacturers were opened to the winds of com-
petition. State spending was slashed. The break
with an almost century-old tradition of state regu-

lation and welfare was a radical one. Instead of pro-

gressive taxation, which transfers income from the
rich to the poor, high rates of income tax, typicalof the welfare state, were slashed. The shortfall inrevenue was made up by an indirect tax on services
and on everything sold, even food, which hit the
poor hardest.What endured were the democratic parliamen-
tary traditions and the legal framework of the state,with the ideal of equal justice for all its inhabitants
of whatever race, religion or ethnic background.
New Zealand had grown from a population of less
than 1 million at the turn of the century to close on3.5 million in 1992, and enjoyed one of the high-
est standards of living in Asia.The hardships, deregulation of employer tradeunion relations and budget tightening reduced
support for Bolger. In the 1993 elections his
majority was reduced to two. But Bolger’s eco-nomic policies paved the way for years of strongeconomic growth from 1993 to 1996. After the
1996 elections he formed a new coalition admin-
istration with the centrist New Zealand First
Party. In the following year while Bolger wasabroad, Jenny Shipley organised a demonstrationcoup that ousted Bolger from the party leader-
ship. She then headed a minority government 
in December 1999 as New Zealand’s ﬁrst woman
prime minister. Economic growth continued
despite the Asian crisis, but the coalition wassteadily losing popularity as it entered theNovember 1999 general election. Labour wonthe election handsomely and a former universitylecturer, Helen Clark, became prime minister. She
was pragmatic in her approach to traditional
labour policies and described her policies as
seeking a better balance between policies of the‘head’ such as economic deregulation and of the ‘heart’, providing targeted welfare that the
country could afford. She expresses her views
robustly and has reasserted some of New
Zealand’s distinctive foreign policy, moving away
from close identification with the US. Sheopposed Britain’s and America’s leadership towage war in Iraq in 2002 and renewed New
Zealand’s nuclear-free policy. Forthright and
plain-spoken she impressed the electorate which,
in the general election in 2002, gave her party alarge majority (41 per cent) over the NationalParty (21 per cent). At home Helen Clark did
not avoid some controversial legislation such as
legalising prostitution for the sake of protecting
the welfare of the women concerned. Thoughregarding the link with the Crown outdated,Clark recognised that the time for making New
Zealand a republic had not yet come. There were
at any rate more important issues to handle.
Immigration is also causing some popular anxiety
and Helen Clark has to be careful in following anon-racist ‘skills’ approach. A quota system is inplace limiting immigration annually. As long as
the New Zealand economy continues to do well
and adapt to conditions in the new millennium,
becoming less dependent on the export of primarycommodities, the Labour Party will continue to receive strong support. Important for New
Zealand is the removal of European Union and
American trade barriers. Clark presses New
Zealand’s interests in this respect. New Zealand
is a country that can look with conﬁdence intothe future of the twenty-ﬁrst century.678TWO FACES OF ASIA: AFTER 1949

LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945:
PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
The population of Latin America and theCaribbean reached 519 million people at the close
of the twentieth century. Yet in twentieth-century
world history Latin America was usually margin-alised, perhaps because it did not in the ﬁrst half ofthe century play a major role in the global conﬂicts
of this century, which had their epicentres in
Europe and Asia. Perspectives began to change
only in the 1950s – not because of a belated
recognition that millions of the world’s popula-tion deserved better, but because of the Cold War.Before then only Argentina’s ﬂirtation with fas-
cism had aroused wider interest. After the Second
World War the spread of Marxism and the inﬂu-
ence of the Soviet Union aroused Western con-cern, especially that of the US. Attention focusedon Arbenz’s Guatemala, on Che Guevara’s efforts
to spread communism from Cuba to the main-
land, on Allende’s Chile, on the Sandanistas in
Nicaragua and on the civil wars in El Salvador,
Guatemala and Peru.With the launching of President Kennedy’sAlliance for Progress in 1961 the US made an
attempt to address the social, economic and polit-
ical injustices of Latin America. But as the fear of
Marxist revolution grew in the 1970s and 1980s,positive policies took second place to ensuring themilitary defeat of revolutionary movements.
Then, as the 1980s drew to a close, two new
issues attracted world attention to South America.
One was the dangers besetting the global envir-onment. Life on earth is dependent on carefulbalances, on a shield in space enveloping theworld. The ruthless destruction of Brazil’s huge
rainforest could have incalculable consequences
for the world’s climate. Attention was thus drawnto the plight of the Indians in Brazil and to thedevastation of large forest areas.The second problem was drugs – cocaine,heroin and marijuana. Heroin was trans-shipped
mainly from Asia, where the poppies grew, and
also from Mexico. Marijuana was cultivated inMexico, Colombia and Jamaica. The greatestdemand, especially in the US, came to be for
cocaine and its derivative, crack. Drugs posed an
immediate threat to the well-being and lives of
mankind. It was estimated that in 2000 therewere 14.5 million addicts in the US alone, spend-ing a hundred billion dollars annually. The drug
scourge had a particular hold on the deprived and
unemployed, so it was rife in the poor black
ghettos. But it was by no means conﬁned to the
poor: crack was used by the jaded and hedonisticof all social classes. Yet the illegal drug trade wasassociated with crime and violence on a hitherto
unprecedented scale.For many peasants in Latin America in the lastdecades of the twentieth century the growing ofthe coca leaf was their only source of income.They were paid little for it. Most of the leaves
were grown in Peru and Bolivia, but Colombia,
with its illegal reﬁneries, was the drug centre of
Latin America; here cartels and drug barons reapcolossal rewards.1Chapter 61THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA
The economic problems of these debt-riddencountries gave the US some leverage in its battleagainst the drug scourge. In return for aid and
trade concessions, President George Bush hoped
to cooperate with the governments of the three
Andean nations, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.Peru was in bad shape economically and polit-ically. It was beset by a hardline active Maoist
guerrilla movement, the Sendero Luminoso or
Shining Path, which specialised in killing sup-

porters of the government. Peru also had a large
foreign debt equivalent to half its gross nationalproduct. Neighbouring Bolivia was one of thepoorest countries of Latin America, with a crush-
ing foreign-debt burden. The armed forces of
these countries, with US help, destroyed some of
the plantations of coca in almost impenetrablejungle clearings, but the growing of coca leavescontinued in many others. Medellín, the drug
capital of Colombia, became the centre of vio-
lence too, with determined government efforts to
strike against the drug barons being answered bybombs and assassinations. In Paraguay, where thedictator General Alfredo Stroessner ruled for
thirty-four years supported by the military, gov-
ernment enjoyed a cosy relationship with the drug
barons. A military coup ﬁnally overthrew him in
1989. It was uncertain whether his successorswould end the corruption and curb the trade indrugs. Drug trafficking involved the whole of
Latin America in shipments to North America and
Peru from the Atlantic ports as well as those of
the Pacific. As long as so profitable a marketexisted in the West, the chances of suppressing itat its source were slim.With the end of the Cold War and the demiseof the Soviet Union, the problems of Latin
America were viewed in less ideological terms. It
was an important world trading partner, most USexports going to the region, and its debts were asignificant factor impeding trade and develop-

ment; to default on them would present a serious
problem to Western banking. Latin America was
also a vital source of raw materials, not leastVenezuelan oil. In Latin America, the ThirdWorld and the Western world lived side by side.
But the enormous economic growth since the
1960s did not improve social justice; democracyremained weak, the military strong; the richbecame richer, the poor beneﬁted little, if at all.Latin America presents a rich palette of cultures;
there is racial injustice but also much intermar-
riage and blending of races. As the twentieth
century neared its end, a demographic time-bombwas ticking away: could the rapid populationgrowth be slowed to a manageable increase? The
problems of the continent were enormous, and it
was vital to ﬁnd solutions for them. Latin America
was not likely to disappear from the agenda of
world history again.In the nineteenth century, investment in LatinAmerica became a proﬁtable destination for the
venture capitalists of Western Europe and the US.
Britain built railways and became the principalinvestor before the First World War, and the US invested particularly in Cuba and Central
America, buying up many great plantations.
While coffee-growing remained largely in Central
American hands, American investment and polit-ical inﬂuence at its height was epitomised by theUnited Fruit Company, which monopolised the
banana plantations and trade, owning its own
shipping line and much else besides by the close
of the nineteenth century.Despite this large inﬂux of foreign money, themasses of Latin America remained poor and thedisparity of wealth and poverty extreme. During
the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, moreover,
there was only a small manufacturing industry
throughout South America. Essentially thereexisted an alliance between the Latin Americanelites – the cattle-raisers of the Argentine, the
owners of the coffee plantations of Brazil and
local merchants – and foreign-owned enterprises,
from which both drew immense proﬁts in good
times, to the exclusion of the subsistence masses.For the consumption of manufactured goods andluxuries the Latin American market remained
small, since 90 per cent of the population did not
earn enough to buy them. This has been one of
the principal impediments to the continent’sindustrial diversification. Without an adequatedomestic base the difﬁculties of establishing man-
ufactures that can be proﬁtable at home and com-
petitive abroad are immense.682LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
Latin American governments are also charac-terised by instability, which, in the past, has dis-
couraged investment – the local elites simply senttheir money abroad to safer havens. It is instruc-tive to compare the heavy indebtedness of Latin
American nations with the estimated flight of
capital abroad from 1982 to 1988. Nevertheless,state sponsorship and foreign investment since1945 are gradually transforming Latin America,
and large-scale industries have been established in
all the major Latin American nations, Mexico,Brazil, Argentina and Chile. As in industrialEurope, there has been a shift from agricultural
pursuits to manufacture, from rural society to
urban. But the forced pace of rapid industrialdevelopment has left many Latin American statesburdened with huge debts to the West which
most have no prospects of repaying at high inter-
est rates. The expectation that with modernisa-tion, with the expansion of a professional middleclass, with the growth of an urban skilled work-
force, their standard of living rising, and with
increasing education and literacy Latin Americanauthoritarian politics would give way to Western-style democracies is not yet being fulﬁlled. In

Latin America, as in other developing regions,
there is no such automatic and inevitable linkbetween economic progress and democracy.In many Latin American states in the 1980s,the military handed government back to demo-
cratic civilian rule. But frequently this representedan improvement only on the surface. AmnestyInternational publishes an annual survey ofhuman-rights violations. It makes salutary read-ing. Torture and killings were still widespread inthe exercise of political power against opposing
groups. During the 1970s and early 1980s this
barbarism probably reached heights not witnessedbefore in modern Latin American history and, onehopes, not to be reached again. At least 90,000
people simply ‘disappeared’; no one knows for
certain how many were picked up from theirhomes or in the street, never to be heard of again.At the trial of the Argentinian junta chiefs in
1985, it was estimated that 9,000 had disappeared
during the six years of military rule from 1976 to1982; in Guatemala, Chile, Haiti and El Salvador,torture and executions without trial by ‘security
forces’ or death squads were widespread.In the 1960s a powerful new voice of pro-test against oppression made itself heard. TheCatholic Church, which for centuries had been a
pillar of conservative society, ceased to give
unconditional support to the ruling elites. But theVatican and Pope John Paul watched with con-sternation any Marxist leanings of bishops, priests
and nuns amid the social tensions and political
struggles of Latin America. In its most extremeform, ‘liberation theology’ looked to Marxism foran explanation of poverty and oppression but
rejected atheism. But mostly the Church was
simply speaking out against the extreme inequal-ities of wealth and against the unjustiﬁed andindiscriminate use of force.This became clear to the rest of the world in1968 when the bishops of Latin America met atMedellín in Colombia in the presence of PopePaul VI and published a most remarkable decla-
ration which read in part:Latin America still appears to live under thetragic sign of under-development ... Despite
all the efforts that are made, we are faced with
hunger and poverty, widespread disease and
infant mortality, illiteracy and marginalism,profound inequalities of income, and tensionsbetween the social classes, outbreaks of vio-
lence and a scanty participation of the people
in the management of the common good –Complaints that the hierarchy, the clergy, thereligious are rich and allied with the rich also
come to us.1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA683

The Church dedicated itself to becoming theChurch of the poor and oppressed. In 1978 theLatin American bishops met again in Puebla,
Mexico, and the majority progressives pressed on
with the new liberation action. ‘Between Medellín
and Puebla, ten years have gone by’, the bishopsdeclared.If we focus our gaze on our Latin Americanregion, what do we see? No deep scrutiny is
necessary. The truth is that there is an ever
increasing distance between the many whohave little and the few who have much ... we
discover that this poverty is not a passing
phase, instead it is the product of economic,
social and political situations and structures.What was needed, the progressive Church leadersurged, was ‘personal conversion and profound
structural changes that will meet the legitimate
aspirations of the people for authentic social
justice’.In Latin America the leading members of theChurch hierarchy knew that if the Church failed
to take the side of the poor the masses in their
desperation would turn for their salvation away
from the Church to a godless Marxism. The
Church soon discovered the inevitable politicalimplications of its new role. It spoke out againstthe ‘disappearance’ of people in Argentina and
Chile and against the death squads of El Salvador
during the 1970s; it defended the rights of labourunions and spoke up for the Indians excludedfrom the mainstream of development in Boliviaand Peru.The most far-reaching change in the attitude ofsections of the Catholic Church took the form of a
campaign to reach out to the ordinary people, togive practical help, to communicate and to organ-
ise by creating thousands of grass-roots commu-

nity groups. These Christian communities in Latin
America sought to ‘liberate’ the people through
exercise of the faith and through stress on the value
and dignity of human life. They were based on self-help through discussion and common action con-
cerned with the practical issues of life and politics.
Priests, nuns and Catholic laity provided leadership
and teaching. But, unlike a left-wing party under
rigid hierarchical control, the groups that sprangup relied on their own initiative. In Brazil, wherethe communities were developed to their greatest
extent, tens of thousands of such groups had been
formed in the countryside and in the shanty towns
by the early 1990s, and as many as half a million of the disadvantaged poor had been broughttogether. A community might consist of twenty or
thirty people meeting in a simple building. They
would celebrate mass with a priest, and then dis-

cuss their immediate problems and concerns. They
would decide on action: to demonstrate, to peti-
tion, to demand basic services for their commu-
nity, such as electricity and housing or perhaps a
health centre. They acquired a sense of self-worth
and conﬁdence in acting together against corrupt
local authorities. Devoted priests, nuns and laityserved them. They taught respect for Christian val-
ues, as well as basic democracy and non-violent
methods of action to improve their lives. In Brazil,
the hierarchy spoke strongly in support of this
community movement and accepted the strained
relations thereby created with the state.Repressive governments understood the risknationally and internationally of taking any drastic
steps against such a strongly united Church.
Nevertheless, there were many martyrs when the
military, no longer conﬁning themselves to accu-sations of communist infiltration, resorted toharassment and murder. One such incident which
attracted worldwide attention in 1980 was the
murder of Archbishop Oscar Romero, an out-684LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED

opposition, the Church became the sole national
voice of freedom. It was itself deeply divided in
some Latin American states, where the hierarchymight be more ready to support the ﬁght againstcommunism than criticise authoritarian govern-
ments. In others, as in Brazil and El Salvador, the
Church was more united in opposition. On the
whole the Church was not revolutionary in
action, but where it took a clear spiritual standagainst injustice and economic exploitation itbecame a force that weakened the standing of
repressive authoritarian regimes and tore aside 
the veil of secrecy with which these regimes
attempted to hide their crimes. In the longer termthe Church functioned as an opposition which,because of the international respect it enjoyed,
undermined Western, especially American, supp-
ort for regimes whose human-rights records had
become indefensible. Other organisations, such asAmnesty, trade unions and resistance groups, alsohighlighted the practices of torture and murder,
but the majority of the church representatives
when they spoke out enjoyed the inestimable
advantage of not being identiﬁed as part of the
left of politics, despite the attempts by regimesseeking to silence them to slander and misinter-pret their motives.In the early 1990s the Church was still makinggreat efforts to improve the lot of the poor
masses. But on the crucial issue of populationcontrol Pope John Paul’s pronouncements wereuncompromising. The only means of birth
control permitted by the Church, the rhythm
method, was too unreliable and was anyway not
effectively practised. Millions of women suffered
the dangers and misery of repeated abortions. Buthigh rates of infant mortality and poverty werealso responsible for the poor desiring large fami-
lies. So there were multiple reasons for high birth
rates. Whatever its cause, the galloping popula-
tion growth undermined progress. It is charac-teristic of regions with high birth rates for theyoung to predominate, and boys and girls from
the shanty towns surrounding many of Latin
America’s major cities turned to begging, stealingand prostitution. Young lives became cheap, forinstance in Rio de Janeiro, where vagrant childrenand petty criminals were found shot dead by vig-
ilante groups. Moreover, millions of peasants and
urban poor in Latin America were malnourished.
Much of the increase achieved in agricultural pro-duction, including coffee, was sent for export – itdid not feed the peasants, who were landless or
eking out a living on the small areas of arable land
divided between them. Most of the land was
allotted to the larger estates. Only two Latin
American countries had low rates of birth in theearly 1990s and these were the two with pre-dominantly European populations, Argentina and
Uruguay. Without population control, moderni-
sation would do little to help the urban poor or
the peasants.With an average annual rate of increase of 3.4per cent, the population doubled every twenty-
one years. Population growth in different coun-
tries varied enormously. Cuba under Marxist
policies cut its increase to just 1 per cent; the high-est rates, above 3 per cent, were to be found inCentral America and Mexico. More than half the
population of the continent lived in two countries,
Brazil and Mexico, with a growth rate above 2 per
cent in Brazil and 3.5 per cent in Mexico.Generalisations about Latin America tend torequire many qualifications. For instance, it is true that only two languages predominate, Por-
tuguese in Brazil and Spanish in the remainder of
Latin America (except for French in Haiti), but
numerous Indian languages are still spoken, such as Quechua and Aymará, derived from theIncas and Maya and Guarani. Cultural traditions
originate not only from the indigenous Indians 
but from the waves of immigrants through the 
centuries: Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, British,
French, slaves from Africa and, in the nineteenthand twentieth centuries, labourers from Italy,Germany, North America and Asia.1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA685

ColombiaColombia is ostensibly a democracy on the USmodel with a directly elected president and anelected Congress, but the conservative elite con-
tinued to ensure its retention of power. Between
1910 and 1930 literacy qualiﬁcations for the fran-
chise excluded 90 per cent of the people. Thelandowners dominated Colombia in the ﬁrst halfof the twentieth century. Coffee became its prin-
cipal export, while bananas were cultivated by 
the ubiquitous United Fruit Company. Modest
reforms inaugurated by the Liberals in the 1930smade only a small impact. The major conse-quence of such attempts was to galvanise right-
wing reaction supported by the hierarchy of the
Church, the wealthy landowners and industrial-
ists. Their declared enemy was one of the leaders
of the Liberal left, Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, whoseradical proposals in the 1940s of land reform andstate intervention in industry were anathema to
Colombia’s elite of so-called liberals and conser-
vatives, who shared power. It was this coalition of
interests that controlled Colombian politics for adecade after the Second World War, opposingland reform and state intervention.The discontented masses of workers and land-less peasants looked to Gaitán for leadership and
change. The government responded with repres-
sion. In 1948 Gaitán was assassinated, an eventthat prompted one of the grimmest chapters inColombia’s violent history. Workers in Bogotá
and peasants in the countryside rose against the
government, occupying factories and seizing land.
Order was restored by the army at the cost ofthousands of lives.After an election had been held in 1950, theconservatives ruled dictatorially alone. Colombian
politics now exhibited two characteristics: violent
repression and liberal economics. But repression
never solved the problem. The geography of thecountry, with poor communications, mountains,valleys and plateaux isolated from each other, was
ideal for Marxist guerrilla groups to operate in.
Police terror and anarchy, guerrilla warfare and
banditry swept through the countryside. By themid-1960s more than 200,000 Colombian peas-ants had been killed.Violence remained endemic in Colombia.Reforms have been too few and too ineffective tohelp the million landless peasants. In the cities the
harsh economic climate of the 1970s the world
over was a further blow to industrial workers.
Coffee prices ﬂuctuated but were generally low.The isolated peasantry now turned to a new crop,the growing of coca leaves. As the 1980s drew to
a close, guerrillas and drug barons perpetrated 
a culture of violence unparalleled elsewhere in
Latin America. In the early 1990s the Colombian
government tried to end the violence by reach-ing agreements with the drug barons and theguerrillas, and a new more democratic constitu-
tion was framed. The violence in the countryside
from fighting between the army and Marxist
guerrillas and the drug trade drove one and a half million peasants to poverty on the edges ofcities. Although weakened, by the end of the
Cold War Marxist guerrilla groups had not been
eradicated. The US, meanwhile, has been princi-
pally concerned to destroy the coca ﬁelds, theonly source of income for the peasants, with herbicides, and cooperated with the army supply-
ing helicopters. But progress in Colombia has
only resulted in driving the growing of coca and
the trade to neighbouring Andean countries,
Bolivia and Peru. As long as the demand forcocaine in the West produces proﬁt for the traf-ﬁckers the growing of coca will continue. The
cycle of the conﬂict and low economic growth is
condemning the great majority of the people to
poverty in the twenty-ﬁrst century. In the newmillennium 40 per cent of the country is in thehands of the guerrillas.PeruThe vast Andes mountain range divides the coastal
strip of western South America from the rest of
the continent. The highlands of the western coast
from Ecuador to Peru and Chile are populated
mainly by Indians, whose way of life has changedlittle over the centuries. In complete contrast, inthe cities on the coast, Santiago, Valparaiso and
Lima, Western traditions and a twentieth-century
way of life prevail.686LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
The masses of Peru suffered during the courseof the twentieth century from a kaleidoscopicvariety of more or less oligarchic governments,
none of which succeeded in bringing about the
fundamental economic and social reforms the
country needed. Despite opportunistic politicalparties proclaiming high ideas of reform, periodsof government by Congress and presidency with
a semblance of democracy were punctuated by
spells of authoritarian rule. Peru was unable to
develop its industries, oil extraction or mining
from its own capital resources. Loans and foreigninvestment were encouraged in one decade, onlyto arouse a nationalist reaction against foreign
dependency in another. The economy swung
from expansion to bust, depending on world
prices for the commodities Peru exported, andlater in the century the crushing foreign debtadded to its burden. But the pattern of Peru’s
economic development did not fundamentally
differ from that of its neighbours.The effect of bad times on the poor was all themore catastrophic as the disparity in wealthbetween the top 7 per cent and the bottom 40
per cent was extreme, even in the 1990s. Almost
all the Indian population, comprising about a
third of the total, was wretchedly poor, the chil-
dren malnourished. Alcoholism and ill healthﬂourished and in the early 1990s cholera frompolluted water supplies reappeared.The splendid buildings in Lima dating from theSpanish colonial period present a bitter contrast to
contemporary misery. A society deeply divided isbound to be a society in conﬂict. Those who ruled
Peru variously tried reform and repression, some-

times both at the same time. The landless Indians
in the highlands hungered after land reform,
migration of Indians to Lima created unsanitary
shanty suburbs, and local industries produced anurban working class. It was fertile territory forcommunism in the 1920s. One of Peru’s best-
known political leaders, Victor Raúl Haya de la
Torre, responded with a socialist programme of
anti-imperialism, state control, nationalisation andthe protection of freedom and human rights. Hefounded in 1924 the Alianza Popular Revolu-

cionaria Americana, APRA for short. APRA was
still a political party in the 1990s and still had astrong following. It soon shed its Marxist inten-
tions when it came to practical politics, since itcould attain power and the presidency only with
the support of the middle class. It never effectively
tackled the Indian problem, which could not be
solved without radical land reform.In the 1960s Belaúnde, of the Popular ActionParty, was elected as a reforming president. But
when the 300,000 Indian peasants rose in revolt
in 1965, the army was sent in to crush them. The
history of Peru does not always follow what is
regarded as a Latin American pattern. The armystaged a coup in October 1968 at the height ofanother economic slump. The junta was headed
by General Juan Velasco Alvarado, a man with
sympathy for the oppressed Indians and the poor
(the Peruvian military has not always been a reac-tionary force). Alvarado declared that the juntawould reform the ‘unjust social and economic
order’ and end subordination to foreign eco-

nomic interests. A revolution was attempted from
above. The large coastal sugar estates were expro-priated and turned into cooperatives. Thelandowners on the coast and in the highlands
were destroyed as an elite with political power.
About 40 per cent of land had been transferred
by 1975. The three-quarters of a million squat-
ters in the shanty towns were given rights to theland and a sense of community was encouraged.Worker co-ownership in factories and manage-
ment was designed to establish ‘industrial com-
munities’ in parallel to the rural communities.
Foreign-owned companies, mainly American,were nationalised. General Velasco’s aim was toestablish a distinctive Peruvian socialism.The economic flaws soon made themselvesfelt. While some workers and Indians were
helped, overall the reforms did not bring the full
beneﬁt that had been expected. Artiﬁcially lowfood prices, designed to help the urban poor, hitthe peasantry. The world economic recession of
the mid-1970s led to a fall in copper prices and
those of other commodities at a time of heavy
Peruvian indebtedness to foreign investors. Thediscredited military junta handed the countryback to the civilian politicians.In 1980 Belaúnde was elected president again.He dismantled the kind of corporate state the1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA687
junta had wanted to set up. Orthodox ﬁnancialmanagement, especially policies designed toreduce the foreign debt, inevitably resulted in
hardship, unemployment and protest. There were
many strikes in Lima. In the remote highlands
opposition was being organised by a new guer-rilla group, the Sendero Luminoso, known in theWest as the Shining Path. Inspired by Maoist doc-
trines, the Shining Path was ruthless in waging
war on the class enemies. Despite sweeps by the
army, the insurgents retained their bases and
plunged the country into bloody strife.In 1985, Peru’s new hope for recovery was theelection of the leader of the Alianza Popular
Revolucionaria Americana (APRA), Alan Garcia.
Young and dynamic he instituted an economic
reform plan that attempted to promote Peruvianindustry. He was no socialist, preferring to leaveindustry in private hands, and his refusal to pay 
all the interest due to foreign investors made him
popular. Thus began a long tussle between 
foreign governments and banks, with the LatinAmerican debtors no longer prepared to impover-ish their people in order to honour their ﬁnan-
cial obligations. Initial American reactions were
hostile especially as Garcia also took a stoutly 
independent line in foreign policy. By the 1990s,
with the US now taking the lead, it was acceptedthat Latin America’s debt burden was too heavy,and that it was better for bankers to accept a
reduction than repudiation and a breakdown in
trade relations. By the time it came to elections
again in 1990, the economy was in a dreadfulstate, crime and drugs were rampant and theShining Path was carrying the bloody struggle
from the interior to the shanty towns around
Lima, murdering ﬁfty mayors in the countryside,
as well as missionaries, priests and peasants. In just
one year, 1989, insurgents and the governmentdeath squads, between them, killed over 3,000people. The people’s disillusionment with their
politicians was vividly demonstrated during the
contest for the presidency in June 1990 when the
son of a Japanese immigrant Alberto Fujimoro, auniversity academic promising reform but virtuallyunknown before, won by a convincing majority.Fujimoro was determined to crush the ShiningPath. In return for protection of the coca growersand drug barons, the Shining Path was ﬁnanced bythe drug trafﬁc. The president introduced emer-gency powers and the conﬂict was stepped up by
both sides. Fujimoro also launched an economic
austerity programme, at the same time liberalising
the economy and denationalising state enterprises.The immediate result was huge unemployment.Backed by the military, Fujimoro seized dictator-
ial powers, dissolving Congress and arresting some
of the political leaders.Fujimoro claimed that he required executivepowers to carry out his programme of deregulat-ing the economy, cutting subsidies and privatis-ing, as well as to ﬁght the Shining Path more
effectively. His ﬁrst success was to capture the
guerrilla group’s leader after an intelligence oper-
ation in a ﬂat in Lima in September 1992. But thatwas not likely to end the struggle with the ShiningPath or the drug growers and merchants. For the
Indians the growing of coca leaves had become an
essential part of their survival economy. Great
hardship was suffered by the people of Peru, andeconomic reforms – if they succeeded – wouldtake years to raise the low standards of living.In 1995 Fujimoro was re-elected. Two yearslater he became a popular hero when he rescued
hostages taken in the Japanese Embassy. He had
taken personal charge of the military operation,which ended with the shooting of their captors.He waged a successful ﬁght against the Shining
Path guerrillas. This reconciled many to his
increasingly authoritarian rule. But by 2000 the
corruption that was uncovered blighted hisattempts to get re-elected despite a constitutionalbar for a third term. The scandal broke, Fujimoro
left the country. The arrest of his spy chief
Vladimoro Montesimo uncovered a veritable can
of worms, widespread fraud, bribery and kick-
backs. The army generals were deeply implicatedin the subversion of democracy and human rightsabuses. President Alejaudro Toledo, Fujimoro’s
successor, promised to restore democratic rule,
and cut the overpowerful army down to size. A
dozen generals awaited trial in 2003 and largenumbers of ofﬁcers have been retired. The guer-rilla movement is not dead but no longer poses a
serious threat. President Toledo’s aim is to return
to democratic civilian government.688LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED

grants. Among Chile’s population, intermarriage
has created a society European in outlook and rel-
atively free from racial prejudice. There are fewpure Indians left, perhaps 300,000, among themthe Araucanian Indians of the south, who have
tried to preserve their way of life against the
encroachments of modernisation.Chile’s riches in metals and minerals made it,by the 1990s, one of the most developed andurbanised nations in Latin America. In the course
of the twentieth century the towns absorbed most
of the population. Agriculture played a signiﬁcant
but decreasing role in the economy, with the 
traditional structures of large estates in the fertilevalleys of central Chile worked by a poor landlesspeasantry surviving into recent times. The close
ties between wealthy landholders and wealthy
industrial magnates enabled these conservative
groups to wield political power far in excess oftheir numerical strength. Industrialisation andurbanisation in the twentieth century created a
relatively large working class, born in Chile and
playing an important role in Chilean politics. The
authoritarian Pinochet regime that ruled for two
decades (1973–90) concealed what had been oneof the distinguishing features of Chilean politicsin Latin America, its traditional constitutional and
parliamentary system, with the military accepting
their subordinate though highly respected posi-
tion. Escalating political conﬂict, the result of
violent clashes of economic and social interests inthe 1970s, a national economy in deep trouble as
a result of failed socialist measures and of a denial
of assistance from the West, especially the US, led
in 1973 to a military coup and, as few had
expected, to a prolonged, ruthless dictatorship.Before the 1920s the Chilean economy wasdependent on the world price of a single com-
modity, nitrates; since then it has been copper.
Prices ﬂuctuated violently and so impeded con-
sistent internal development. Politics, too, werevolatile. It is all the more remarkable that from1891, after the end of a short but bloody civilwar, until 1973, with the exception of a shortperiod (1927–31) of suspended civic liberties andmilitary rule, the parliamentary system survived,
with regular national elections and peaceful trans-
fers of power from one ruling political coalition
to another. Throughout these years political for-tunes were heavily dependent on the economichealth of the state, which in turn was dependent
on the economies of the industrialised West.
What made Chilean progress even more prob-
lematical was that its prime export-earner, copper,
was owned by foreigners. US companies trans-ferred the bulk of the proﬁts home and did notinvest them in the less favourable conditions of
Chile. The one issue on which all political parties
were agreed was resentment of the US, and when
the copper companies were eventually nation-
alised in 1971 by Salvador Allende, the measureuniquely received unanimous support in the
Chilean Congress.Characteristic of the period of politics in Chilefrom 1891 to 1927 was the emerging alliancebetween the conservative landowner–merchantelite and a middle class alarmed at the rising
demands of trade unions whose members were
struggling in the inflation-ridden economy to
maintain their living standards. The government
response was more often repression and impris-onment of union leaders than concession andlegalisation of union activities. At the same time
efforts were made to reduce workers’ militancy by
means of welfare legislation. The military took
over in 1927, but the impact of the depressionmade government a thankless task and the gen-erals handed control back to the civilian politi-
cians and Congress in 1931. Copper prices, which
had fallen precipitously, recovered very gradually
after 1932; the economy was so managed that
Chile escaped the scourge of the 1930s, massunemployment, at the cost of low wages andinﬂation. As the decade drew to a close, Chilean
politics had become polarised. Working-class
politics and union strength had greatly increased
and a popular front was formed, a coalition thatwas no more than mildly socialist in its policies,and inherently unstable when in ofﬁce. At no time
did it pose a threat to the Chilean tradition of
parliamentary government.1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA689
The coalition of the left was exposed to thehostility of the US as the Cold War developed. In1948 the Communist Party was outlawed (though
not for long). During the next twenty-ﬁve years,
Chilean politics remained deeply divided, elec-

tions ﬁercely contested. The left could not mustermajority support and was kept out of power by acoalition of the centre-right. Unemployment was
still held in check but the economy was stagnating
and inﬂation a constant problem. The beneﬁts of
a substantial rise in copper prices from 1945 to
1955 were counterbalanced by an equally large fallin production. In the 1960s Chile’s economic andsocial problems multiplied and would have been
even worse without the support of Kennedy’s
Alliance for Progress. The problems of the rural
poor had not been effectively tackled; their inﬂuxinto the cities created massive new demands forhousing, education and employment, a common
experience in the underdeveloped regions of the
world. The small population (11.2 million in
1980) and its weak buying power could not sus-tain large-scale home industries except in the mostbasic goods, which poor people can afford to buy.No Chilean government in the twentiethcentury had, so far, found a solution to social and
economic problems: to the confrontation of polit-
ical parties and to the opposing interests of thepoor, the middle classes and the wealthy elite.Any bold policy that attempted to breach the
status quo was immediately stymied by the oppo-
sition in the Chilean Congress. Yet, for just one
decade from 1964 to 1973, Chile’s politicalleaders did try to break out of this cycle, and theirfailure had tragic consequences.As the presidential elections of 1964 ap-proached, the communist–socialist alliance, led 
by a veteran Marxist politician Salvador Allende,
looked like polling the most votes, though hewould not win an absolute majority; the parties ofthe right were second in strength, and third was a
new Christian Democrat Party, pledged to imple-
ment thorough reforms and led by Eduardo Frei.
To prevent the left coming to power, the partiesof the right decided to back Eduardo Frei. Allendecalled for a socialist revolution and Frei for a ‘rev-
olution in liberty’, which would not endanger
civic rights or rights to property. The Johnsonadministration in Washington was determined todo what it could to keep Allende from winning.There must be only one ‘Cuba’ in the hemisphere.
The CIA channelled substantial funds to Frei’s
campaign, and he won easily. Nevertheless,
Allende, who had nearly won in 1958 in a three-cornered contest, made a strong showing.Frei’s policies were boldly reformist and he washelped by a large inﬂux of US aid amounting 
to $327 million from 1964 to 1967. One long-
standing problem concerned the US copper con-
cerns. Frei did not nationalise them, but bought astate share as part of a Chileanisation programme.The state took an interventionist role in planning
the economy. Local industry was diversiﬁed; with
the country rich in timber, a paper industry was
established, and petrochemicals were developed.Joining the Andean Pact with Peru, Bolivia,Ecuador and Colombia created a larger market.
But the emphasis was on nationalism and inde-
pendence from foreign economic domination. A
more determined attempt at rural reform wasmade and the break-up of the large estates wasbegun. Between 1964 and 1967 copper prices
rose steeply, as did production. Then copper
prices fell again and inﬂation soared. There were
large-scale strikes met by violent repression. As the
1970 presidential elections approached, all classesof society, for different reasons, were becomingdisenchanted with Frei’s economic reforms. With
the conservative right now putting up their own
candidate and the constitution preventing Frei
from standing again, it was clear that this wasAllende’s opportunity.President Nixon and his national securityadviser, Henry Kissinger, regarded an Allende vic-

tory as totally unacceptable to the US. It would
end Cuba’s isolation and, they believed, mark the
beginning of an advance of Marxism in SouthAmerica. Subsequent US congressional investiga-
tions have revealed the extent of US intervention.
The Chilean military were encouraged by the CIA,
on instructions from Washington, to stage a coup
to prevent Allende assuming the presidency. Butthe Chilean army commander-in-chief, GeneralRené Schneider, stood by the constitutional
process and blocked the plot. The conspirators
thereupon decided to remove him: he was shot and690LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
killed, possibly accidentally, when a third attemptwas made to abduct him. This brutal interventionoutraged the Chilean generals and the planned
military coup did not materialise; another constitu-

tionally minded commander-in-chief replaced the
murdered man. When the election results wereannounced, Allende had won the largest numberof votes, 36.3 per cent, but his rightist rival came a
close second with 34.9 per cent and the Christian
Democrat had secured 27.8 per cent. Allende
could rightfully claim the presidency and was duly
inaugurated by Congress, but he could not assertthat he had won a national mandate to undertakea socialist revolution. For that, in any case, he
would need majorities in Congress, which would
be able to veto any Marxist transformation.The three years of Allende’s presidency in Chileare one of the most bitterly disputed periods inLatin American history. To some Allende became
a martyr; his supporters accused the US of repress-
ing the righteous struggle of a Marxist for the bet-
terment of the people. In fact, he achieved moreby his death at the hands of the military than hehad accomplished during his presidency; the bar-
barity of what followed brought out the contrast
between the humane president and his successor,
General Augusto Pinochet. ‘Allende’ became the
rallying cry of the left and of the many demandingjustice and change in Chile.The economic fundamentals were not favour-able to Allende, and the price of copper was turn-

ing down from a peak in the late 1960s. Although
Frei had made progress, it was not enough; andhigh inﬂation, which Frei had attempted to checkwith austerity measures, had returned. Allende
restored and improved the living standards of the
workers by a large increase in wages while control-

ling prices. The beneﬁt was short-lived: a boom
was followed by higher inﬂation. Allende’s left
coalition was committed to a transition to social-
ism, which meant state control of the economy to
a much greater extent than his predecessor had
thought possible or desirable. On the issue of for-

eign companies operating in Chile, nationalismand resentment of their economic role united allparties when in 1971 Congress approved the
nationalisation of the US copper companies.
Compensation was denied on the ground thattheir excess proﬁts over the years had exceeded anycompensation due. Other US companies, powerfulin the US, such as Ford and ITT, were taken over
too; but when it came to nationalising the big
banks and the largest concerns in Chile, there was
an outcry from the industrial elites. Vigorous landreform enacted by Frei but until then hardly imple-
mented added the landowners to the implacable
opposition. The middle classes were alarmed by
the expansion of state control, from which only the
smallest enterprises appeared to be exempt; it was
easy to frighten those small shopkeepers by sug-
gesting that their private ownership would not lastlong either. Meanwhile, the expectations of many
workers ran high. Through occupation of factories
they tried to force the hand of the government,
and sometimes they succeeded in doing so, thoughAllende tried to retain control of policy.A number of key questions now arise. WasAllende leading Chile to a fully Soviet-style state,
as his opponents maintained? Allende was an
experienced politician who had participated inChile’s constitutional politics for many years. Henow headed a coalition of the left, which extended
from moderate socialists to the communists, who
were themselves more moderate than their East
European counterparts; but the coalition also
embraced extreme radical groups who wanted tohasten the creation of a socialist state. WouldAllende be able to control the coalition, or would
the extreme elements take over? By 1973 Allende
had boxed himself in; he could rid himself of the
extremists only if he could secure the support ofthe reformist Christian Democrats. That he triedto make an opening to the centre shows that his
intention was not only to maintain himself in
power but to moderate the course of change. He
was not a mouthpiece of Moscow but a socialist
seeking a Latin American solution to Chile’s eco-nomic and social problems.Nor was Allende following in Castro’s path,though the Cuban leader was enthusiastically
received when he visited Chile in 1971. Allende
did not forcibly dissolve Congress, abolish theopposition parties or rule by making use of repres-sion, terror, censorship or the suspension of civil
liberties. There may have been supporters for such
a course among his coalition partners, but the1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA691
army’s loyalty was to the constitutional processand if Allende had tried to establish an authoritar-ian Marxist regime he would have plunged Chile
into civil war.The path to socialism was blocked byCongress, where the opposition had a majority.Allende resorted to undemocratic means to bypassCongress and to continue expropriations, making
use of his presidential powers. He proposed a con-
stitutional amendment, replacing Congress with a
People’s Assembly and submitting this to a
plebiscite. Congress predictably rejected thisdevice in 1972. The proposal marked the highpoint of Allende’s attempts to create a Marxist
state. Allende did not pursue this extra-legal
course; instead with the economy in chaos he
moved towards Frei’s Christian Democrats. Theirsupport would have provided the coalition with aﬁrm majority in the country while neutralising the
extremists in the coalition. The negotiations came
to nothing and the appalling state of the economy
in 1973 was creating widespread unrest. The inﬂa-tion rate had reached 150 per cent, inexperiencedbureaucrats were running the state sectors of
industry, private industry was demoralised and fac-
tory owners were not inclined to cooperate with a
socialist government. A black economy ﬂourished.
Foreign credit was exhausted. And the sorry stateof the economy was primarily the result ofAllende’s policies, though the Nixon administra-
tion remained implacably hostile and helped to
undermine Allende. The principal US weapon was
to deny aid and loans, which totalled only $18million for the three years from 1971 to 1973, asagainst $156 million from 1968 to 1970. Since
mid-1970 Nixon had blocked the Chilean econ-
omy, and private investment dried up.For a year, from the summer of 1972 onwards,there were increasing numbers of strikes, boycottsand mass street demonstrations of the pro- andanti-Allende masses. The opposition encouraged
this public confrontation and the Marxist coalition
called out its supporters. In the congressional 
elections in the spring of 1973, which were freeand democratic, Allende’s Unidad Popular notonly held on to its support but increased it (com-
pared with the presidential election) to 43 per
cent, though this was still less than the combinedopposition ﬁgure of 55 per cent. The weakness ofAllende’s ‘transition to socialism’ was that it neverwon the support of the lower-middle class – the
shopkeepers and small traders, those with some
stake in a free-enterprise economy. By the summer
of 1973 terrorist incidents were added to large-scale strikes and demonstrations. After negotia-tions with the Christian Democrats had failed,
Allende sought the support of the army and
brought in a moderate general as minister of
defence. On this general’s resignation, Allende
turned to another who was believed to share thearmy’s traditional constitutional outlook –Augusto Pinochet. But the military were plotting
a coup. On 10 September 1973, they struck.
Allende hurried the following morning from his
private residence to the presidential palace, reject-ing offers of safe conduct and exile in the LatinAmerican tradition. By this courageous decision
he ensured that the coup would be condemned as
unconstitutional. An attack by ﬁghter planes set
ﬁre to the palace and Allende died there resistingthe assault on his authority, an outrage in the longconstitutional history of Chile.The military junta’s campaign of repressionagainst civilian supporters of the former Allende
government also had no parallels in Chilean
history. Certainly nothing as bloody had occurredsince the civil war almost a century earlier.‘Suspects’ were rounded up in the football
stadium. Thousands of likely opponents were
imprisoned; thousands were murdered, perhaps
5,000, possibly three times that number, duringthe early days after the seizure of power. Thehope of the urban poor and peasants for a new
deal was buried under bayonets. The military
ruled, Allende was gone and Washington heaved
a sigh of relief. But it was one thing to get rid of
a Marxist leader, another to replace him with areformist, democratic, free-enterprise governmentrespecting human rights. This is what the US
wanted, as did the majority of the Chilean people.
General Pinochet, who emerged as the caudillo,
the strongman of the junta, broke with Chileanmilitary tradition and did not hand back power tothe civilian politicians. His regime ‘suspended’ all
political activity, sent Congress packing and drove
political parties underground. The democratic692LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
representative constitution was set aside and anemergency ‘state of siege’ declared that effectivelyabolished freedom and civil rights. These were
not short-term measures. The ‘state of siege’ was
only lifted ﬁfteen years later in the summer of
1988 as Pinochet was seeking to improve theimage of his repressive regime on the eve of a ref-erendum designed to conﬁrm him in power; even
Chilean exiles were now invited to return.But Pinochet’s ﬁrst task in 1973 was to ensurethe security of his military regime. This he did
during the next ﬁfteen years by waging a ruthlesscampaign to eliminate any opposition; peoplewere picked up in the street or in their homes and
just ‘disappeared’, without trial; their relatives
were told that nothing was known about them.
All social classes were affected, and all shades ofpolitical opinion, though the main target was theleft wing. A regime of terror was inaugurated.
Women as well as men were imprisoned, tortured
and killed; others languished in prisons and
camps. The ‘disappeared ones’ became one of themost horrifying features of recent Latin Americanhistory. In Chile (a rough estimate) 3,000 are
missing, in Argentina 30,000, in Guatemala
35,000, in El Salvador 9,000, in Haiti 15,000;
children were orphaned, their identities obliter-
ated, and they have been adopted by politically‘safe’ parents. These ﬂagrant violations of humanrights aroused only sporadic protest in the West,
but Pinochet was safe from any effective inter-
national interference. The attitude of the US was
of particular importance.The Nixon–Ford administrations wanted astable government in Chile, preferably one that
was reasonably democratic and supported a free-
enterprise economy, with a decent human-rights
record. But the US also saw in Marxism a cancer
spreading out from Cuba; it had to be containedin Cuba; should it break out of this isolation,given the severe problems of Latin America, it
would not halt in any one country, but would
spread to the neighbours of the US and present
a threat to America in its own hemisphere. Thefight against communism was therefore to begiven priority. Large-scale aid once more ﬂowed
to Chile: loans to assist economic recovery, aid
under the Food for Peace programme (eighttimes larger than what was given during theAllende years) and funds to purchase arms. In allthese measures the Nixon–Ford administrations
expressed their support for Pinochet. It is true
that their purpose was to defeat communism, not
to underpin the Chilean regime’s brutalities, butthey could not escape the dilemma: the two werelinked – they were making, as they saw it, the
choice that best served US interests. As Kissinger
explained, the US should not become involved in
‘temptations to crusade’. But Senator Edward
Kennedy and other members of Congress embar-rassed the Republican administrations with theiropposition and their attempts to restrict aid to
Chile by linking it to human rights. The admin-
istrations’ task thereby became more difﬁcult, but
ways were found to continue giving aid from1973 to 1976, the most repressive years of thePinochet regime, during which the opposition
was decimated. For them, by the time the new
Democratic president Jimmy Carter made human
rights a key plank of US policy, with particularreference to Latin America, it was too late. Aid toChile and other repressive regimes was drastically
cut, without noticeable effect on the brutality of
these regimes. The US could not bring about
their fall by economic means, nor was economic
aid sufﬁcient to maintain them. That is why USpolicy in Chile is such an instructive example ofthe difﬁculties and frustrations that appeared to
face Washington’s policy makers.It was in Chile, too, that Western academiceconomists and technocrats were allowed a deci-
sive inﬂuence in policy making to cure the eco-
nomic chaos that was prevailing at the end of
Allende’s presidency. The Chilean generals did 
not understand economics but, opposed as they
were to socialism, backed free-market remedies
being advocated by Professor Milton Friedman’sChicago School. At its most basic, the theory wasthat the free-market system should be allowed to
function and that all artiﬁcial restraints, such as

protection of economic sectors that were otherwise
not competitive, trade unions bidding up wagesbeyond their market value, state-run industries notdependent on commercial profits, should be
removed. Inﬂation would be cured, and market
forces would achieve a balance between supply and1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA693
demand, provided the government balanced itsown budget and kept the supply of printed moneyin check. Ideologically, the father of this eco-

nomics was Friedrich Hayek, who saw in socialism
and its central controls the modern road to slavery.
The attitudes and expectations of workers andemployees could best be changed by the sharpshock of changing the protectionist system quickly.
Paradoxically, it was a nation that had fallen under
a vicious dictatorship, the kind of state Hayek most
abhorred, which now provided the laboratory.In Chile the technocrats did not have to worryabout the immediate practical consequences:workers would be cowed and trade unions would
not be allowed to interfere. In a less authoritarian
regime, the severity of Chile’s inﬂation (it had
reached 500 per cent in 1973) would haveensured that the remedies were applied with morecircumspection. Looked at in the short term, the
economic policies adopted in Chile were success-
ful. People even talked of a ‘Chilean miracle’;
inﬂation was down within a few years to less than10 per cent; the growth rate in the 1970s washealthy. But the price paid in terms of distress
experienced by the poorest was equally spectacu-
lar; there was large-scale urban unemployment
and mounting debts. The bankers had miscalcu-
lated in their belief that good proﬁts could beearned from Latin America’s most repressiveregimes which had a record of keeping their coun-
tries stable and which repaid their foreign loans
punctually. Then the decline in commodity prices
in the early 1980s hit Chile hard, dependent, as itstill is, on exports of copper; servicing the foreignloans places an increasing drain on an economy.The Pinochet regime also came under mount-
ing pressure, not only from opposition at home
expressed in massive strikes, but from the Reagan
administration, which in 1986 sponsored a UNresolution criticising Chile’s human-rights record.Even his fellow generals opposed Pinochet when
he declared he would stay in ofﬁce until 1997. In

September 1986 he narrowly survived an assassina-

tion attempt; this he countered with another boutof severe repression, which included arresting lead-
ers of the opposition. The left-wing guerrilla
group, the Patriotic Front, planted bombs. The
papal visit of John Paul II in 1987 brought morecriticism on Pinochet’s head and the generals wereopenly calling for a hand-over to a civilian presi-
dent. Violent street demonstrations accompanied
Pinochet’s 1988 campaign for the plebiscite
designed to conﬁrm him in the presidency until
1997, but the general was sufﬁciently conﬁdent to
lift the state of emergency and to allow the oppo-
sition to campaign against him. In the event the
Chileans rejected Pinochet by the surprisingly
small majority of 463,833 votes out of a total of
just over million. No doubt the improved econom-
ic situation, with substantial growth from 1985 to1988, and memories of the chaos Allende had leftbehind him had persuaded nearly half the voters 
to back Pinochet – better the devil you know. But
the result was decisive enough. In December 1989
Patricio Aylwin Azócur, a 71-year-old lawyer, wonthe presidential elections and was inaugurated inMarch 1990. Pinochet did not retire but conﬁned

himself to the role of commander-in-chief. In
November 1990 he celebrated his seventy-ﬁfth

birthday – too old, one might hope, to turn theconstitutional clock back again, but it remained tobe seen whether the army would resume its former
role of respecting representative constitutional
government. Although the price paid in human
terms was considerable, the Pinochet years trans-

formed the national economy.In the aftermath of the military regime, thecountry learnt the grisly truth about the years of
dictatorship. Nearly 2,300 had died, many by
shooting and torture, and nearly 1,000 had simply
disappeared (at least one unmarked mass gravewas uncovered). One of the hardest tasks con-fronting Chile in the 1990s was to come to terms
with its past, and to keep the military in check. It
also faced the challenge of reforming its social and
economic structures – including health provision,
education and housing – while at the same timeensuring employment and maintaining a free-market economy. The ghosts of the Pinochet
years are receding, Pinochet old and ill has slipped
into irrelevance. The democratic government is in
control. Constitutional reforms in 2003 elimi-nated the life senators and the army will no longerbe permitted to play a leading role in politics. The
amnesty for the part played in the ‘dirty war’ was
also annulled.694LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
ArgentinaLike Chile, Argentina was ruled by an authoritar-ian military junta during the 1970s which paid no
respect to human rights. Unlike Chile, however,Argentina had never developed a broadly basedparliamentary tradition. The second-largest coun-
try in Latin America after Brazil, Argentina covers
an area greater than Western Europe, but the
countryside is sparsely populated, since grain-pro-duction and cattle-ranching, the agricultural back-bone of Argentina’s export economy, require
relatively few labourers. It trades profitably,
exporting wheat and refrigerated beef and import-
ing manufactured goods. Before the SecondWorld War, Britain had the largest foreign stake,having invested in railways and some industries.
Argentina’s population is concentrated in the
towns and grew rapidly from less than 2 million in
the mid-nineteenth century to 8 million by 1914,
and to 37 million in 2000. This growth derivedmainly from massive immigration from Italy andSpain during a period of rapid expansion from the
1880s until the onset of the depression in 1929.
Argentina thus became the most Europeanised of
Latin American nations, but these Western tradi-tions were more those of southern Europe, whererepresentative government and democracy had
not ﬂourished in what was still, then, a largely
underdeveloped region. Government in Argentina
was nominally representative and democratic, but
in reality it was manipulated by a wealthy oligarchywhose power was based on their ranches andrelated agricultural industries and, of course, on
the support of the army. The oligarchy had noth-
ing to fear from peasants in the countryside, as
there were practically none; nor were there indi-genous Indians in signiﬁcant numbers: they hadbeen decimated in the last of the Indian wars
towards the close of the nineteenth century whenthe military took away their lands to the south andsouth-west of Buenos Aires.Political, social and economic tensions arosefrom a different quarter as Argentina developed –
from the urban workers, the small shopkeepers,the low ranks of trade, industry and the profes-sions, excluded from inﬂuence and from a fair
share of the country’s growing wealth. They did
not, however, organise themselves to participate
in the electoral process. Trade unions, which fol-
lowed the anarchist and syndicalist traditions ofSpain, were severely repressed and their leadersimprisoned.More successful was another new group ofoutsiders, the recently prosperous and the middle
classes, who had gained their share of economicbut not political power. They formed the RadicalParty and ﬁnally came to power in 1916. In the
strikes following the First World War, their
earlier, more sympathetic attitude to the urban
workers turned to repression. In socialism, syn-dicalism and anarchism they identiﬁed the enemywithin. During the 1920s the urban workers’
wages rose but expectations grew even faster. The
Radicals had made many enemies on the left as
well as among the ousted conservative oligarchy,
and a limited democracy functioned only until amilitary coup in 1930. The conservative–militaryalliance, contemptuous of democracy – though
manipulated elections were held – saw much to
admire in the Nazi Germany of the 1930s and
only entered the war against the Axis at practi-cally the last possible moment to avoid exclusionfrom the Allied United Nations in 1945.1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA695

By then the military had tired of the vestiges ofrepresentative government, with its party systemand the disproportionate power the conservative
oligarchy enjoyed. In 1943 the ofﬁcers organised
a coup; the rising star among them was Colonel
Juan Perón. While the corporate state in Europefaced defeat, it survived in Franco’s Spain and wasto survive in Perón’s Argentina. Perón and his
mistress and later wife, Evita, created a new power
base, an alliance of the army with the hitherto
politically powerless masses of urban workers. The
workers remained powerless but they gained theillusion of power by supporting the charismaticcaudillo. Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and
Perón in Argentina were apparent anachronisms in
the Western world, which had fought for freedom
and democracy, but they survived and ﬂourished.Perón could also claim legitimacy after he wonelections in 1946 with a strong showing of 54 per
cent. One reason for his success was the introduc-
tion of a host of social welfare schemes, higher
wages, minimum wages and pensions. Evita usedstate funds to ﬁnance her foundation which show-ered beneﬁts on orphans and the poor. When she
died in 1952, still young and beautiful, the
national mourning was unprecedented. The myth
of Evita supported Perón’s rule which, under its
glossy populist surface, used the repressive tacticsof a fascist regime. A state economic plan and stateintervention, with a drive to industrialise, were
designed to build a new Argentina. The workers
prospered.The economic downturn after 1949, however,soon brought old tensions to the surface. Moreorthodox economic management lowered stan-
dards of living and political theatre and the sup-
port of the Peronist masses alarmed the Church
and the oligarchic and military elite. In September
1955 the military engineered another coup andPerón quietly departed into exile. An independ-ent, elected, civilian president was allowed to rule
for just four years from 1958 to 1962, before the
military deposed him and seized power again: they
were always ready to mount coups when the out-come of the electoral process displeased them.The president elected in 1963 lasted only another
three years before a further military coup. But
throughout the decades the appeal of Peronism,despite the efforts of the military to suppress it,did not lose its glamour among the urban masses.Argentina depended on world markets for itsexports and imports, but in general the terms of
trade during the 1950s and 1960s moved against
primary producers, though there were brief peri-ods of prosperity, not least because it presented ahome market large enough for considerable
expansion of the industrial sector. Argentina was
plagued by wild swings of economic policy
between boom and slump, and it was saddled with
the ever increasing burden of foreign loans.Despite its ‘European face’, in its economic devel-opment and the strength of its military, Argentina
was also very much a Latin American country.Amid mounting political violence, Perónreturned in 1973 and was elected president, butit was too late for him to achieve a political rerunof his former success. Nine months after his elec-
tion he died. His third wife brieﬂy assumed the
presidency, but she was quite unable to master
the deteriorating economic and political situation.In March 1976 a military junta staged yet anothercoup and took over power for the next six years.This junta turned out to be the most bloody andrepressive in the modern history of Argentina.
The world media was able to draw attention toits brutality thanks to the courage of the women,the ‘grandmothers’ who every week demon-
strated silently before the presidential palace,
holding placards and pictures of members of their
family who had ‘disappeared’. Their disappear-ance was the consequence of the ‘dirty war’ thejunta waged indiscriminately against the opposi-
tion; not only were guerrillas arrested and killed
but anyone regarded as subversive could suffer
the same fate. For the military there were no con-
straints imposed by a rule of law. Mass graveswere subsequently discovered, but no one can besure how many died during the years of terror –
perhaps 30,000. And in managing the economy
the generals were no more successful than their
predecessors. Early improvements in response tostricter monetary controls gave way to inﬂationand recession in the 1980s.In a bid to divert popular discontent the junta,then headed by General Leopoldo Galtieri,696LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
decided on a surprise invasion of the BritishFalkland Islands, claimed by Argentina as Las IslasMalvinas. The Falklands had come under British
occupation in 1833, and the sparse population of
some 2,000 overwhelmingly wished to remain
British. Under international law, the Argentinianshad a doubtful case, but successive British gov-ernments would still have preferred a solution
that satisfied Argentinian national pride. The
main obstacle to a settlement proved to be the
British Parliament which understandably would
not hear of any diplomatic solution that mighthand British citizens over to an authoritarianArgentinian regime. There was no chance of any
peaceful outcome once the Argentinians launched
an invasion of the islands on 2 April 1982. The
British governor and his guard of a few soldierscould offer only token resistance. The UnitedNations and other intermediaries, including
General Alexander Haig, the US secretary of
state, attempted to find a peaceful solution,
before the British military and naval task forcebeing assembled 8,000 miles away could reachthe Falklands. One of the most controversial
events in the war was the sinking by a British sub-

marine of the Argentinian cruiser, the Belgrano,on 2 May with great loss of life, at a time when
the Argentinian navy was on its way home. PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher was accused at thetime of having deliberately torpedoed a promis-
ing peace plan that had only just been proposed.
It is more than doubtful that the generals would
have withdrawn the force from the Falklands,which was the minimum British requirement. Ina short conﬂict the untrained Argentinian con-
scripts were no match for the British profession-
als, but the Argentinian air force, with its modern
ﬁghters and up-to-date weapons, inﬂicted severe
casualties on the task force. On 14 June 1982Port Stanley was recaptured and the Argentiniancommander surrendered.In Britain there was no feeling of enmity orhatred for the young Argentinians caught up in
the conﬂict. At the ‘victory’ church service in StPaul’s Cathedral, prayers were said for both theBritish and the Argentinian dead. It was the most
unnecessary war of modern times, and could per-
haps have been prevented had the British govern-ment listened in time to warnings of an impend-ing invasion. Instead, inadvertently, the wrongsignals were sent to Buenos Aires. The invasion
itself had been greeted in the Argentinian capital
with wild enthusiasm, though the British residents
were not in any way molested – to that extent, atleast, it was a civilised conﬂict. A deep chord inArgentinian nationalism had been touched, and
the generals were heroes. The let-down of defeat
was bound to be traumatic. The one good result
was that the military junta could not hope to stay
in power much longer. The military made way forcivilian rule in October 1983. Raúl Alfonsín andthe Radical Party won the subsequent election.Alfonsín inherited appalling economic prob-lems exacerbated by his inability to end the state
of conﬂict on the basis of accepting British sover-eignty over the Falklands. After the casualties theBritish had suffered, a compromise of that princi-
ple, possible perhaps before the invasion, had now
become unthinkable. The Argentinian economy
did not recover, which made Alfonsín increasinglyunpopular at home, but the president, a lawyer byprofession, restored the rule of law, and human-
rights violations ceased. This earned him inter-
national recognition and goodwill. Those in the
military responsible for torture and murders dur-
ing the ‘dirty war’ were brought to trial, a devel-opment unprecedented in Latin American history.A handful of the military, as well as the leaders of
the junta, were sentenced to various terms of
imprisonment in 1985. But Alfonsín was not
really strong enough to come to grips with themany criminals in the army, which remains apotential power in the state. The most serious and
immediate threat to democratic institutions in
Argentina, however, has been the perennial prob-
lem of the economy. When Raúl Alfonsín became
president in December 1983, the inﬂation ratehad reached 2,000 per cent, and foreign capitalhad ﬂed from the shattered economy. Alfonsín’s
conservative economic measures and his wage and
price controls stabilised the economy only for a
time, and did so at the expense of the workers’standard of living.In 1986 the Peronist General Confederation ofLabour called strikes against the economic pro-
gramme and in the following year the Peronist1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA697
opposition provided good evidence of their reviv-ing strength when, in elections for provincial gov-ernors, they won most of them while Alfonsín’s
Radical Party only just retained a majority in the
Chamber of Deputies. The economy continued to
deteriorate, and the army was growing restless,though attempted coups by rebellious elements ofthe military were easily defeated by loyal comman-
ders. Inﬂation was close to 200 per cent in 1988
and reached 600 per cent in 1989; the hardships
this caused were a gift to the Peronists. Their
choice for presidential candidate in May 1989 wasan unusual one, the charismatic 59-year-oldCarlos Saul Menem. Alfonsín had lost the will to
govern and transferred the presidency to Menem
(who had won the election) prematurely in July.Menem began with a drastic austerity pro-gramme, but by the end of the year Argentina wassuffering even worse inflation. The president
attempted, in a Peronist spirit, to build agreements
between state employers and trade unionists, with
the blessing of the Church. Amnesties granted tothose members of the military convicted ofhuman-rights offences, including three of the
imprisoned junta, were also intended to reconcile
the army. The breakdown of Menem’s marital rela-

tions, his wife claiming she had been locked out of
the presidential palace, added an element of colourto Argentina’s chaotic domestic situation.In October 1990 Menem issued decrees curb-
ing the right of the Peronist-dominated trade
unions to strike, a move that created a split among
his supporters. Two months later, the restivenessof the military led to an attempted coup, and topacify the armed forces Menem pardoned the
high-ranking ofﬁcers responsible for torture and
murder during the ‘dirty war’. His reputation ulti-

mately, though, would depend not only on
whether he could dismantle the Peronist corporatestate, with its featherbedding, its swollen bureau-
cracy and its uncompetitive state enterprises, but
also on whether inﬂation could be kept under con-

trol in the long term. He made a determined start
in 1991 to privatise state industries and turnArgentina into a deregulated market economy.Hyperinﬂation was curbed, the internationalbankers were delighted and overlooked the risks.
The price of modernisation and reform was highunemployment, but by 1997 the Argentine econ-omy seemed to be in robust growth as trade liber-alisation, privatisation and foreign investment
fuelled production. It all went horribly wrong.
The Argentine peso had been pegged to the 
dollar on a one-to-one basis during the decade ofthe 1990s and Argentinians had enthusiasticallychanged their pesos into US dollar greenbacks.
Rising foreign and international debts, the world
economic slow down and unbalanced budgets,
brought about a spectacular crash when the
International Monetary Fund would not rescuethe currency. In December 2001 devaluation fol-lowed and Argentina defaulted on its debts. The
dollar peg was unsustainable. The banks closed
their doors. The economy descended into barter,
angry Argentinians demanded that they beallowed to draw on their savings now frozen bydecree. Rioting in Buenos Aires forced President
Fernando de la Rua to resign in January 2002.
Congress appointed a caretaker president who was
then followed by Eduardo Duhaldo. It was theworst ﬁnancial crisis in Argentina’s history withconsequences reminiscent of the Great Depression
of 1929. This time not only the poor but the mid-
dle classes were venting their anger. Argentina’s
default on its debts closed help from the Inter-
national Monetary Fund. Remarkably, democraticinstitutions did not collapse and bring the army topower. After a year of chaos Eduardo Duhaldo’s
interim government succeeded in creating a sem-
blance of stability once more. The future, how-
ever, in this once wealthiest of Latin Americancountries remains clouded by the continuingﬁnancial crisis and weak political leadership. More
than half the people live in dire poverty and one in
ﬁve are unemployed. A new surge of protest and
unrest has only been avoided by governemnt
ﬁnancial handouts. The International MonetaryFund is in negotiation with the government toﬁnd a way forward.UruguayA contrast to a large and powerful country is the
small state of Uruguay. Uruguay had for a long
time enjoyed a tradition of comparatively free and698LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
representative civilian government. It was a pro-gressive and prosperous country exporting meat,cereals and wood and its population of less than
2 million in the 1950s, with large-scale Euro-
pean immigration, was relatively homogeneous.
Uruguay also enjoyed the distinction of havingintroduced the ﬁrst welfare state in the Westernhemisphere. It was not coincidental that tiny
Uruguay was chosen to launch the Alliance for
Progress in Latin America. But the strength of
these traditions did not save Uruguay from a mil-
itary coup in 1973. The excuse was the need tosuppress the left-wing Tupamaros guerrillas. Theﬁrst three years of military rule witnessed torture
and killing of victims as horrifying as any in Latin
America.As elsewhere in much of Latin America, mount-
ing economic problems returned the soldiers tobarracks in 1984. The military leaders handed over
to a civilian government the task of clearing up the
mess and assuming responsibility for the unpopu-

lar austerity measures that would be required. Thecivilian president in turn attempted to amnesty the military who had been involved in human-
rights abuses, but angry demonstrations and the
Uruguayan Congress frustrated his efforts until
1989. Austerity measures provoked strikes and
general dissatisfaction. One positive developmentwas that the Tupamaros guerrillas ended their ﬁght
and entered politics; another that free presidential
elections could be held in November 1989, which
gave victory to the candidate of the opposition.
Democracy has shown itself admirably robustdespite its economic problems. Uruguay was badlyhit by Argentina’s ﬁnancial collapse. To help the
country from following Argentina into default a
savage austerity programme and IMF loan condi-

tions caused the population real hardship.BrazilUruguay’s north-eastern neighbour is Brazil, the
largest and most powerful country on the SouthAmerican continent. Although Brazil is the neigh-bour of all but two South American nations
(Chile and Ecuador on the west coast), geogra-
phy and the Portuguese roots in its history havetended to isolate it from the rest of the continent.Yet there are common Latin American featurestoo, such as the question of the fate of the indi-
genous Indians; in Brazil, intermarriage has prac-
tically submerged them in the multiracial society
of European and African origins. In the leastapproachable recesses of the Amazonian jungleIndian tribes are precariously surviving, threat-
ened by progress, exploitation and the cutting
down of the rainforests. There are probably only
about 220,000 Indians still inhabiting the fron-
tier regions, who supposedly enjoy governmentprotection.Until the end of the Brazilian empire in 1889,Brazil, despite its rich mineral resources, was a
comparatively backward country relying mainly
on the export of coffee. To provide labourers forthe coffee plantations, Africans were sold intoslavery and transported to Brazil, where slavery
was not abolished until 1888. Brazil relied mainly
on exporting coffee and importing manufactured
and luxury goods to satisfy the small urbanmiddle class and the wealthy plantation ownersand merchants until the 1920s; a small industrial
sector developed, and the coffee oligarchy domin-
ated politics until the revolution of 1930. The
first strong push for industrialisation occurred
during the years from 1930 to 1945 when thecountry was ruled by the authoritarian regime ofBrazil’s first outstanding political leader of
modern times, Getúlio Vargas.Vargas, brought to power by the army in 1930against a background of economic crisis, intro-duced a new authoritarian constitution in 1937which established what was called the estado novo.The state became supreme in politics, industrial
relations and economic management. No parallel
social revolution was attempted. Vargas had to
maintain the support of a coalition of interests:merchants, industrialists, the landed oligarchy ofplantation owners with their ill-paid dependent
rural workers, a subsistence peasantry, and urban
workers preserved their unequal shares of the
national wealth. Strict labour laws controlled thegrowing numbers of industrial workers. The statenationalised the banks and basic industries, and
an iron and steel industry was started. Although
by the close of the Second World War Brazil still1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA699
relied mainly on the export of coffee, the basis forits later industrial growth was laid during theVargas dictatorship.That dictatorship came to an end in October1945, when the army forced him into exile. In
the conditions prevailing after the war, with thevictory of the Western free world over Nazityranny – although Vargas had shrewdly joined
the Allied cause in 1942 – Vargas’s authoritarian
state was regarded by the army as an embarrass-
ment. The US was now all-powerful in the
Western hemisphere. An election was held inDecember 1945, though only half the electoratewas enfranchised; two generals competed for the
presidency. The outcome was the formation of a
conservative government ardently hostile to com-
munism. In 1950 Vargas entered the next elec-toral contest and won, but his attempt to createa power base by gaining the support of the
workers with wage rises and sympathetic labour
legislation soon revealed the limits of Brazil’s con-
stitutional system. He did not last out his term.The right-wing military charged Vargas’s admin-istration with corruption and communist pene-
tration. Driven from ofﬁce for a second time in
1954, Vargas ended his contest for leadership by
committing suicide.The presidential election of 1955 was won byJuscelino Kubitschek with the popular JoãoGoulart, Vargas’s minister of labour, as running
mate. Kubitschek campaigned for the defence of
democracy and fast economic growth. The army
watched to make sure that he did not stray toofar to the left, but mounted no military coup, assome urged it to do. In a limited sense it could,
therefore, be credited with safeguarding parlia-
mentary government. The military saw it as their
patriotic duty to stabilise a guided democracy
with a preference for civilian rule. A decade later,elected president again, Goulart attempted toreform the country’s archaic land and tax struc-
tures. He also wanted to extend the franchise 
to the illiterate peasantry to check the power of
the rural oligarchies. Frustrated by Congress,Goulart’s policy initiatives grew more radical as heappealed to the left for support, and not only to
the industrial workers but to the peasants as well.
He now added land expropriation to his reformpackage. This brought the wrath of the army andopposition down on him.A conspiracy had been taking shape in 1964among right-wing army ofﬁcers and conservative
politicians, with urban middle-class support, to
stage a coup. It was assured in advance of USgoodwill. On 1 April 1964 Goulart was over-thrown virtually without a struggle and ﬂed to
Uruguay. The military took over. This time they
did not hand power back to civilian politicians.During the early years of the generals’ rule,repression had not yet taken its more extremeforms. A façade of parliamentary government wasmaintained. Then a new constitution in 1967,
which curtailed political rights, prompted left-
wing urban and rural guerrillas to resort to arms,
but they never secured a mass following. Theironly spectacular success was the kidnapping of theUS ambassador in 1969. From 1968 to 1973 the
military junta reacted with ferocity. The torture
and murder of opponents became common and
widespread, and the repressive security apparatussurvived the defeat of the guerrillas. The variousattempts made by the generals to enlist broader
support and a more acceptable constitutional
image all failed. Internal opposition, strikes and,
particularly, the condemnation of the most radical
Catholic Church in Latin America wore down thegenerals’ desire to accept the responsibility of ruling Brazil. They handed the government back
to civilian rule in 1985. It was no coincidence that
this was done at a time of severe and prolonged
economic crisis. And the military in the 1990s hadnot abandoned their role of intervening when theyjudged it to be necessary.The Brazilian economy had expanded spectac-ularly since the Second World War, transforming
the country into a modern industrial giant. Coffee
no longer dominates and amounts to only about10 per cent of total exports. By 1981 Petrobas,the huge oil and chemical state industrial
complex, was the largest corporation in Brazil by
far. Modern technology is represented in the
armaments and aircraft industries, which exportto the rest of the world. The multinational oilcompanies have established themselves, while
Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen have
developed an efﬁcient motor industry. Foreign700LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
industry and private investment, and the largebank loans required, were attracted by the avail-ability of cheap and plentiful local labour, which
showed itself eminently capable of being trained;
no less attractive were the repression of labour
and the comparative freedom from strikes, as wellas the political stability which the generals’ policestate seemed to guarantee. Thus the unhappy link
was established between capitalism, foreign pen-
etration and repression which so powerfully fuels
anti-Western, particularly anti-North American,
sentiment among the masses.The Brazilian economy achieved rapid growthbut it also had to weather periods of austerity and
retrenchment when forced development pro-
duced high inflation and severe balance-of-
payments crises. After the Vargas period, the next phase of spectacular growth was kickstartedby the ambitious economic plan masterminded 
by President Juscelino Kubitschek in the 1950s.
It was he who decided to construct the brand new
capital of Brasilia as an expression of the country’sunity, conﬁdence and ultra-modernity, but hisboom, based on attracting foreign investment,
had to be followed by another period of auster-
ity. Under the generals a new boom began in
1968. It was checked but not stopped by the
tripling of oil prices in 1973–4. Foreign bankers,ﬂush with Middle Eastern oil money, poured itinto Brazil which, accordingly, accumulated the
largest foreign debt in the world.Brazil had already become predominantlyurban before the 1950s, but the urban workersdid not share in their country’s wealth. Their realwages, which had been rising in the 1950s, fell
again after 1960; many workers received no more
than the minimum wage, which during these two
decades almost halved. This, in turn, provided the
proﬁts for an industrial and technical elite andallowed Brazil to enjoy spectacular growth rates.By 1981 the cycle of growth had come to a full
stop. The economy in the 1980s was overshad-
owed by the need to service the foreign debts
and, despite a successful industrial sector, theBrazilian government could not devote to socialand welfare programmes the resources so desper-
ately needed by the poor. The crippling con-

straints this imposed on the Brazilian economycreated that vicious circle of social deprivation andpolitical instability characteristic of so much of theSouth American continent.As elsewhere in Latin America, the civilianadministration of President José Sarney in 1986
introduced a harsh austerity programme; inﬂationwas halted for a time, but the plan collapsed andinﬂation was back at 800 per cent in 1987. Apart
from the state of the economy, the burning ques-
tion was whether Brazil would become some sort
of democracy by virtue of the new constitution.
When this was promulgated in October 1988, the president was allowed wide-ranging powersand the armed forces were given the ambigu-
ous responsibility of maintaining ‘constitutional
order’. In other respects the repressive rule of the
previous military dictators was repudiated. Thenew constitution guaranteed basic civil rights,including the right of workers to strike as well as
freedom of speech and the freedom of the press.
Another restructuring plan for the economy to
beat rampant inﬂation was launched in January1989. President Sarney’s obvious failures led tohis defeat in the presidential elections that
November. A more positive aspect of his admin-
istration was that it took the ﬁrst steps towards
protecting the Amazon rainforests, whose de-
spoliation had aroused international concern.In March 1990 the new president, FernandoCollor de Mello, was inaugurated. Mello pro-

mised to transform Brazil’s economic chaos. A
stylish 40-year-old, he vowed to help the under-
dogs, the ‘shirtless ones’, and to end the misman-agement and corruption of the years of thegenerals and President Sarney.Mello began his presidency with the mostradical austerity measures of any Latin American
reformer by freezing 80 per cent of all but the
smallest ﬁnancial assets for eighteen months. Heslimmed down the large bureaucracy and vowedto move towards a free-market economy, dis-

mantling Brazil’s high tariffs and exposing the
featherbedded state industries. The result in his
ﬁrst few months was unemployment and reces-sion. By the summer of 1990 he had to ease upon some of his draconian measures and inﬂation
began to rise once more. The economic future
also depended on a favourable settlement with1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA701
foreign creditors to ease the payments on Brazil’shuge debt. A preliminary agreement was reachedin 1991. Mello’s determination to stop the despo-
liation of the Amazon and to protect the few
Indian peoples still left won world approval. It
only slowed and did not halt the advancingdestruction. Brazil was also chosen for the EarthSummit, a conference intended to protect the
environment but which achieved little.Brazil dominates the economy of southernLatin America: Mercosur, the regional economic
free trade area, was founded in 1990 by Brazil,Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay; in 1996 Chilebecame an associate member. Trade between them
has risen ﬁvefold. A decade after the end of military
rule much had been achieved in Brazil. It has
opened its trade to the world: in the mid-1990s itsGross Domestic Product was three-quarters that ofChina, whose population is seven and a half times
larger. But the functioning of democratic govern-

ment has been far from smooth. In December
1992 President Fernando de Mello was forcedfrom ofﬁce surrounded by scandal. His successorItamar Franco inherited an economy whose cur-

rency had collapsed, with hyperinﬂation exceeding

1,000 per cent. Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
appointed minister of ﬁnance, began the task of

economic reform. In 1995 he was elected presi-
dent following his success in opening the marketand subduing inﬂation. But Brazil’s problems of

protecting the rainforests, saving the indigenous
peoples, and providing for the teeming millions of
poor crowded into shacks lacking sanitation,remained as urgent as ever at the end of the 1990s.The low educational standards of the children 
of the poor hinder progress throughout Latin
America. In Brazil more than 2.5 million children
receive no schooling and those who do average less
than six school years. The disparity between thenorth and the south of the Western hemisphereremained extreme despite progress as the twentieth
century came to a close.During the course of Cardoso’s two presiden-tial administrations not surprisingly Brazil’s illswere not all mastered, especially the high crimeand murder rate, but as the longest serving demo-
cratically elected president he achieved some
progress, the most important through his secur-ing a ‘ﬁscal responsibility law’ which imposed dis-cipline on local state and central spending and socurbed inﬂation. In social reforms the housing
and education took pride of place; nearly all the
children gaining access to primary schools. A pro-
gramme of land reform settled on the 600,000landless peasant families. Yet, underemploymentand unemployment remained high in 2003, not
far off one in ﬁve. Brazil’s ﬁnances remain parlous
though saved from default in August 2002 by a
$30 billion loan from the International Monetary
Fund, the Brazilian administration promising toabide by its ﬁscal conditions. Public sector debthad risen from 30 per cent in 1994 to 56 per cent
of the GDP in 2002 and foreign debt absorbed
90 per cent of Brazil’s export earnings. Reforms
of pensions and taxations, and the rooting out ofcorruption remained essential if the extreme dis-parity between wealth and poverty was to be
tackled. Cordoso could not offer himself again
and his chosen successor was defeated by the
charismatic Lula da Silva and his Worker’s Party.This was Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s fourth elec-
tion campaign. He was born in the poorest section
of society and rose from shoeshine boy to ﬁery

union leader and presidential candidate. Once a
socialist radical, by 2003 he presented a more prag-

matic moderate image, no longer the nightmare offoreign investors whose support is indispensible forBrazil’s economy. Lula da Silva set out to show
that contemporary ‘liberal socialism’ can work with
the market and capitalism for the beneﬁt of all the

people, while promoting public services. In placeof class conﬂict he promised a ‘social pact’, theworking together of all sides of industry. The big
new idea was to bring together politicians, unions,
business and non-government organisations in a
Council of Economic and Social Development to
discuss reforms before they were submitted toCongress. Hailed by Brazil’s 50 million poor as asaviour, Lula da Silva promised a new spurt of
growth and widespread reforms, all amid a contin-

uing world economic slowdown in 2003.What will he be able to achieve? The gapbetween promise and reality may prove too wide.His mission, the eradication of poverty and
improving on the gross disparity of wealth, was
expressed in his inaugural speech on 1 January702LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
2003 with his vision of Brazil leaping into thedeveloped world of prosperity, justice and equal-ity and providing every Brazilian with three
square meals a day.For the present, Antonio Palocci, his ministerof ﬁnance followed a prudent course. But shouldLula’s efforts fail to bring the results his support-ers aspire to and the mood threatens to turn
against his policies, will the radical reappear?VenezuelaVenezuela is able to generate a large proportion
of its wealth not from manufacture but by extract-
ing oil from among the most productive oilﬁelds
in the world. Oil contributed 90 per cent of itsexport earnings in the 1980s and nearly a thirdof its gross national product. Agriculture plays
only a small role in the economy. In the 1960s it
overtook Argentina as the wealthiest country in
Latin America. In 1987 its population of 18.3million was estimated to have a gross per-capitaincome of US$3,230. The two oil-price explo-
sions in 1973–4 and 1979–80 brought enormous
new wealth and enabled it to diversify industrially
into petrochemicals, iron, steel, paper, and the
aluminium industry. Western bankers fell overthemselves to provide credit. Caracas acquired theskyscrapers of a twentieth-century city. And yet
by the close of the 1980s Venezuela too was beset
by the severe problems common to the rest of the
continent. Oil prices stagnated and fell back, andVenezuela was unable to meet the scheduled pay-ments to service its large debt. Its economy was
over-extended. The bonanza of ‘black gold’ did
not beneﬁt everybody.Caracas in the 1990s was surrounded by someof the worst slum townships in Latin America, andthere was a high birth rate among the poor.Despite the best system of roads in Latin America,
the countryside was cut off and the number of
Venezuelans making their living from it dropped
rapidly from 40 per cent in 1950 to 18 per cent in1980. The peasantry, largely landless, survived inconditions not much better than servitude; three-
quarters of the land was held in large estates,
despite land reforms introduced in the 1960s.Although from the 1920s until the Second WorldWar, Venezuela was the largest oil exporter, and inthe early 1990s still ranked among the top pro-
ducers, comparative wealth and economic devel-
opment did not go hand in hand with enlightened
politics and social policies.Until 1958, Venezuela was renowned for beinga country under the control of military caudillos.
By shrewd manipulation a prosperous cattle 
raiser and coffee grower Juan Vicente Gómez 
had managed to make himself one of Latin
America’s longest-surviving dictators, remaining in ofﬁce from the time he seized power in 1908until his death in 1935. This was a remarkable
effort, accompanied by corruption and self-
aggrandisement. By the time of his death Gómez
had acquired land equivalent in extent to Denmark and the Netherlands put together. However,Venezuela’s development, based on the oil indus-

try, allowed a new professional and middle class 
to emerge, who were excluded from power by 
the landed elite and the military. They turned forsupport to the peasant masses and formed theAcción Democrática Party under the leadership of
Rómulo Betancourt. In 1945, with the appearance
of democratic government very much the fashion,
Betancourt and his Acción Democrática seized
power with the help of disgruntled members of themilitary. Reforms were attempted – land reform forthe peasantry and an extension of the franchise 
in the constitution of 1947. Elections followed.
But the military and landed elites threw out the
newly elected president Rómulo Gallegos inNovember 1948 and for ten years Venezuela wasruled by the military. Under Pérez Jiménez
(1953–8) the opposition was suppressed. ‘Stability’

suited the foreign, especially US, oil interests in
Venezuela, and foreign technocrats developed the
industry under Jiménez’s benevolent eye.In 1958 Jimenez and his corrupt governmentwere overthrown in a military coup which for
once had popular support, and Betancourt
returned from exile. Vice-President Nixon arrived
in Caracas on a Latin American goodwill missionto a rough reception from a stone-throwingcrowd which identiﬁed the US as the principal
supporter of the former dictator Jiménez. The
elections held in 1959 were won by the Acción1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA703
Democrática Party, and Betancourt became theﬁrst president to complete his term of ofﬁce, sur-viving many assassination attempts. The demo-
cratic process was at last striking ﬁrm roots, with
peaceful transfers of presidential powers in subse-
quent elections. As far as land reform was con-cerned, however, the drive had gone out of theAcción Democrática, and the more conservative
Christian Democratic Party, with which it alter-
nated in power, blocked reform anyway. But in
both health care and education, Venezuela made
signiﬁcant progress during the Betancourt years.The man who made the biggest impact ondomestic politics was Carlos Andrés Pérez, who
became president in 1974 and nationalised the
iron and steel industry and the foreign-owned,
mainly US, oil companies. Venezuela was dis-
tancing itself from US economic and politicalhegemony. Joining with Mexico, Colombia and
Panama in the ‘Contadora’ peace initiative to
bring peace to Nicaragua and the other Central
American states rent by guerrilla wars was anotherattempt to organise Latin American affairswithout US intervention.From the mid-1980s Venezuela faced graveproblems economically, with the fall in oil prices
and the burgeoning foreign debt. Carlos Andrés
Pérez returned as president after winning theelection in 1988, but his introduction of an aus-terity programme in 1989 led to rioting in
Caracas that left 300 dead. He had won the elec-
tion on his promise to ease Venezuela’s debt
repayments. The oil-price rises of 1990 lightenedthe burden, but as long as Latin American statesremained heavily dependent on the unpredictable
price ﬂuctuations of one or two commodities,
while carrying large debts from earlier proﬂigate
development plans, their economies wouldremain precarious. The hardship caused by eco-nomic reform and austerity programmes repeat-edly threatened the democracies with social
unrest. The unequal distribution of wealth aggra-
vated the problem. Despite a spurt of growth
again in Venezuela in 1991, profits failed totrickle down to the poor. Early in the followingyear, Pérez’s popularity had sunk very low and
disaffected elements in the army, hit by declining
wages, attempted a coup. Pérez was attempting
to reform the democratic process shot through
with corruption. Narcotics became a major exportbesides oil. In hard times the people became dis-illusioned with their unprincipled democracy.A small group of Venezuelans had ﬁlched thebeneﬁts of the potential oil riches while 80 per
cent of the people remained poor. When oil prices slumped again after 1997 and Venezuela’seconomy plunged into disarray, there was a
popular upsurge against the corrupt politicians
and institutions that had ruled Venezuela for forty
years under the guise of democracy. In the elec-tions of December 1998 they turned to a pop-ulist leader who promised revolutionary change.
Hugo Chàvez won a landslide victory and at ﬁrst
was carried forward by a surge of unprecedented
popularity for his ‘promised revolution’. An ex-
military colonel, Chàvez sports a paratrooper’s redberet on his campaigns. Folk hero to the poor,his failed attempt at a military coup had landed
him in prison for two years in 1992. Now he was
the legitimate president. Venezuelan politics were
thrown into turmoil as he battled the establishedpolitical elites in Congress and the Supreme Courtwith the introduction of a new constitution and
Assembly packed with his own supporters. In
April 2002 he was brieﬂy overthrown by an army
coup but, with popular support, regained ofﬁce.704LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED

Venezuela.1THE WORLD OF LATIN AMERICA705
In the 1980s, revolution, civil war and the anti-communist drive of the US in the Western hemi-

sphere turned world attention to Central America.
The year 1990 marked a turning point in thesebloody Central American conﬂicts. The civil war in
Nicaragua ended. After a fair election the Marxist
Sandinista regime stepped down and handed the
government peacefully over to the opposition.There are six states wholly in Central America:Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador,Panama and Guatemala. Their combined popula-tion was only about 26 million in 1989, though
population growth had been very high in the
region, as it had been throughout Latin America.Indeed, population growth in the early 1990sthreatened to prevent any increase in the standardof living and to condemn the masses to depriva-
tion and poverty. In addition, the resources that
were available were not shared fairly. The contin-
uing inequalities were most marked in the unjust
distribution of the available land. The wildly ﬂuc-tuating prices for the agricultural exports ofcoffee, bananas and cotton, on which these
nations were still dependent, created a severe eco-
nomic crisis, because the prices of manufactured
imports did not move in unison, while the costof oil imports reached dizzying heights beforefalling back and rising again in 1990.An attempt was made in the 1970s to createmore balanced economies that would rely less 
on manufactured imports and develop import-substituting industries. Ten years later this onlyadded to the general economic calamities of themajority of Latin American nations. In common
with the rest of Latin America the Central
American states borrowed heavily from bankersﬂush with Middle Eastern oil money. The resultwas that a crushing debt burden, getting ever
larger with high interest rates, turned the appar-
ently temporary difficulties of the 1970s into 
permanent crises. Of course, the difﬁculties never
were just temporary. Political and social reforms,including a redistribution of land, were indispens-able preconditions of better economic and social
health. The causes of Central America’s problems
required radical remedies, regional as well as inter-
national. Nothing short of a massive effort couldstabilise the region – an effort of will on the partof the developed world to cease protecting its 
own markets and to pay higher prices for Central
America’s agricultural exports, as well as to 
guarantee these prices against wild ﬂuctuations.
International bankers would also need to writedown their investments realistically, while wealthyLatin Americans would have to invest in their own
economies instead of sending their money abroad.In 1961 hopes and expectations had beenraised by President Kennedy when he launchedthe Alliance for Progress. His aim was to trans-form Latin America’s economic and social ills by
peaceful means. This was to be the free world’s
democratic answer to the Marxist revolutionary
challenge. But enough aid to meet the enormouseconomic problems was not forthcoming; muchChapter 62CENTRAL AMERICA IN REVOLUTIONCOSTA RICA, NICARAGUA, HONDURAS, 
EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, PANAMA 

AND MEXICOof what was given was diverted to military securityagainst social revolution in the 1960s. Social revo-
lution and a more equitable distribution of wealth
and land was condemned by the powerful elites inLatin America, who claimed these measures wouldopen the way for communism. Just as fearful of
far-reaching reforms were the Latin American
middle classes. Thus there was no will for political
and social change among the ruling and inﬂuentialgroups. Yet this lay at the very heart of what theAlliance for Progress was supposed to be about.
With the death of Kennedy, and Johnson’s grow-
ing preoccupation with Vietnam, the Alliance
petered out as more democratic and socially
responsible regimes failed to evolve. The Alliancefor Progress did not achieve for Latin Americawhat the Marshall Plan had done for Europe. The
cycle of violence, deprivation and revolution was
not broken; the answer given to Marxist revolu-
tion was military suppression.However, in some of the Central Americanstates a certain amount of progress was achieved,
especially in Costa Rica and Honduras; but even
here it was too little; in the others – Nicaragua, El
Salvador and Guatemala – repression and the
murder of peasants and of the urban oppositiongoaded into armed terrorist resistance created athirty-year cycle of bloodshed and violence.
Despite Washington’s good intentions in pushing
for democratic and economic improvements and
for an end to the abuse of the most fundamentalhuman rights, the image of the US was marred,especially during the two Reagan administrations
(1981–9) by the priority given to security and to
efforts to halt the spread of Marxism in the
Caribbean and South and Central America. The
misery and destruction borne by the peoplethrough the years of revolution, civil wars andconﬂict were a terrible price to pay. Even afterthey were settled in the mid-1990s corruption
blighted the region.Costa RicaCosta Rica is the most fortunate of the Central
American states, free from civil war (except for abrief period in 1948), with a GNP per capita in1987 of $1,610 with the highest income per head
of population and one more equitably distributed
than elsewhere in Latin America. It is also the
only Latin American nation with something
approaching an established democratic parlia-
mentary system. Abuses of human rights are nottotally absent, as Amnesty International reports
reveal, but their scale is small compared to those
of the other states.Costa Rica had established a constitutional liberal state in the 1920s with free and fair elec-tions. The collapse of coffee prices, on which it
depended, had a devastating effect throughout
Central America. The more liberal oligarchic par-
liamentary governments in the region gave way to
the strongmen, the caudillos, who would preservethe interests of landowners and merchants andmeet the threat of labour and social unrest. Only
in Costa Rica, with its strong constitutional tradi-
tion, was the caudillismo somewhat softened 
in the 1930s and 1940s by regular presidentialelections. José Figueres was the outstanding political leader to emerge in the post-1945 
period. Reformist Costa Rica enjoys an extensive
social-welfare programme, and José Figueres’s
revolutionary junta (1948–9) strengthened the
parliamentary tradition. Women were enfran-chised and after losing the elections Figueres1CENTRAL AMERICA IN REVOLUTION707

stood down. Perhaps the junta’s most unusualaction, given the Latin American context, was toabolish the army. Still, by Western standards,
Costa Rican constitutionalism had decided de-
fects. Organised labour was harshly repressed,
reforms would be granted from above rather thannegotiated with workers and peasant organisationsfrom below. As in most of Latin America, stan-
dards of living in the early 1990s remained tied to
agricultural prices and the cost of manufactured
imports. Despite diversiﬁcation of the economy,
coffee and bananas were still the backbone ofexports. The problems of the 1970s and 1980sburdened Costa Rica with a huge foreign debt.Meanwhile internationally, Costa Rica, whichaided the Sandinistas in the overthrow of the
Somoza dictatorship in neighbouring Nicaragua,was drawn into the struggle between the Nicara-guan Marxist regime and the US. It became the
far from enthusiastic host to the Contra bases
along its borders. Its president, Oscar Arias
Sánchez, was a leading proponent of attempts tomediate peace in the region. The end of the civilwar in Nicaragua and the electoral defeat of the
Marxist regime in 1990 lessened tension and
promised a better future as the presidency
changed hands and Arias Sánchez left ofﬁce.HondurasHonduras, in contrast to Costa Rica, is the poor-
est of Central American states, and its high birthrate impedes efforts to raise living standards substantially. The income per head of population
in 2000 was less than $1,000. Look up Honduras
in the index of a Latin American history and the
ﬁrst subheading is ‘bananas’, yet the miserable
returns from the foreign-dominated banana plan-tations kept the country poor and underdevel-oped. Honduras is the most apt example of a
‘banana republic’, practically speaking under US
economic control because Americans own most of
the agricultural sector and much else besides. USadministrations wanted to see progress towardsconstitutional democratic government and rising
living standards, especially during the years of the
Kennedy Alliance for Progress, but this wouldhave necessitated agrarian reform, the raising ofagricultural wages, and the acceptance of some ofthe demands made by labour organisations which,
in turn, would have damaged the interests of
American investors. Ofﬁcial Washington had its
own set of priorities. Foremost among them was awish to halt the growth of the left. The authori-tarian military rulers were regarded as safer allies,
as well as providing a better guarantee of security
for investors.The policies adopted by Washington fromKennedy to Reagan varied, but ideological andsecurity concerns in the last resort predominated.In 1954, a successful strike by the banana workers
against the United Fruit Company ushered in a
period of unexpected change in this most back-
ward of republics. After a period of politicalturmoil Villeda Morales became president andattempted, like Arbenz in Guatemala and
Figueres in Costa Rica, to reform Honduras’s
rigid social structure and to transform society
from above. But when land reforms threatened tohurt the interests of the United Fruit Company,Washington forced a retreat. In 1963 a vicious
and bloody military coup overthrew Morales.
Although Honduras gradually returned to civilian
rule in 1981, the army with its American-trained
ofﬁcers remains, behind the constitutional façade,the real power in the nation. The economycannot free itself from foreign domination, and
progress has been slow, while corruption is rife.
In the conﬂict with Nicaragua, however, Hon-
duras was the most important ally of the US andwas host to the principal Contra bases.GuatemalaThe problems besetting Guatemala are those of a
nation half of whose population, the 4 millionMayan Indians, do not share any sense of iden-
tity with the other, white Spanish-American half.
The gross income per head of population in 1987
was only $870. Power resided with the army andthe coffee-growing elite. For a century, from themid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth, four caudil-
los ruled the country. The ﬁrst hope for the poor
and illiterate majority came in 1944 with a small708LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
middle-class revolution supported by sections ofthe army. Free elections brought to power JuanJosé Arévalo (1945–51) and Colonel Jacobo
Arbenz Guzmán (1951–4). Forced labour was
abolished, social reforms were initiated and
extended to the Indians, a labour code and landreforms were started. Arévalo had opened gov-ernment to the left and Arbenz accelerated 
the process, thereby thoroughly alarming the
land-owning aristocracy and Washington, which
believed that communism was gaining the upper
hand. US-owned companies and land belongingto the United Fruit Company were nationalised,and more nationalisation was threatened. The
Communist Party was legalised.With the help of the CIA, Arbenz was over-thrown in 1954. The clock was turned back; theold oligarchy and the United Fruit Companyregained their inﬂuence, with the army now again
the real power in the land. There were thousands
of killings and the Marxist labour movement was
wiped out. Corrupt and inefﬁcient military-runregimes became the despair of the Americanadvisers, who could see no alternative other than
the communists. In 1960, Guatemala became the
staging post for the invasion of Cuba. After
another military coup in 1963, the military
remained in control of Guatemala until 1982.The repression of guerrillas and leftist opponentswas particularly bloody – the civil war killed
120,000. The sheer extent of the abuse of human
rights was unequalled in degree even by the low
standards of Central America. Labour leaders,university teachers and political opponents just‘disappeared’; 40,000 are estimated to have died
in this way. By the early 1980s the army chiefs
fought each other for the spoils of ofﬁce – and
this was the army that had received substantial US
military aid. Amnesty in 1982 accused theGuatemalan government of massacring 2,600people, and that was an underestimate.Guatemalan politics are subject to a cycle ofhope and disillusionment. In 1986 Vinicio
Cerezo Arévalo was inaugurated as a popularreforming president. The hope was that he wouldend the brutal excesses of the generals who 
had dominated Guatemala for three decades and
under whose authority the security forces hadmurdered an estimated 65,000 civilians. But thereforms did not last. The military soon began toexert their power again. Death squads resumed
their murderous missions, killing student leaders,
trade unionists and human-rights advocates.
Guatemala became a proﬁtable transit point forColombian cocaine on its way to the cities of theUS. Almost half the population was unemployed
and inﬂation was high; civilian government in
1990 was losing control and making little effort
to check violence, crime or corruption. In January
1991 Jorge Serrano Ellas became president andassumed the burdens of trying to end violenceand restore the economy.El SalvadorEl Salvador’s descent into civil war and bloody
conﬂict was equally tragic. It is the smallest and
most densely populated Central American repub-
lic. Some forty families owned most of the coffeeplantations and dominated banking and the mer-cantile sector. The distribution of wealth is grossly
unequal and the per-capita income was almost as
low as that of Honduras.The history of peasant uprisings and protestsis a grisly one. A communist-inspired peasantrevolt ended in 1932 in wholesale slaughter, aprecedent for contemporary times. Here, too, US
attitudes after the Second World War were shaped
by the fear of communist penetration. Alliances
between the wealthy oligarchy and the militarywere regarded as the only viable alternative andthe US has supported them, thereby impeding
reform and change. In 1969, El Salvador brieﬂy
went to war with Honduras and the resulting
victory further enhanced the prestige of the mil-
itary. But the military and oligarchy began to bechallenged by the rise of an urban middle sector.José Napoleon Duarte led a rapidly expanding
Christian Democratic Party. By the 1970s there
appeared to be a possibility of more representa-
tive government. It was a false hope. In 1972,the army frustrated the election that would havebrought Duarte to power and he barely escaped
with his life. But repression in El Salvador did
not bring stability. The economic deterioration1CENTRAL AMERICA IN REVOLUTION709
following on the oil-price rise in 1973–4 led toincreased guerrilla activities as more and moreSalvadorans became desperate. It also led to
another ‘dirty war’. Brief efforts at reform were
superseded by military regimes that paid no regard
to human rights. Worldwide attention was dir-ected to the methods of the hated regime whenArchbishop Oscar Romero, an outspoken critic of
these abuses, was murdered in 1980. Right-wing
death squads set about murdering whomever
earned their disapproval. In 1980 alone there were
close to 10,000 political murders. The civil warrages on and the US has aided and trained theSalvadoran army to crush the guerrillas, who ter-
rorise the countryside. Under pressure from the
Reagan administration, internationally supervised
elections were held in 1982, but the guerrillasrefused to lay down their arms and participate.The extreme right won, but in 1984 the more
moderate Christian Democrat José Duarte was
ﬁnally elected president.Under heavy US pressure, civilian rule and reg-
ular elections appeared to change El Salvador’spolitics for the better. But the government was
hardly in control: guerrillas dominated regions of
the countryside, and the army remained a law unto
itself. The activities of right-wing death squads
lessened – the US could claim an improvement inthe human-rights position – but so many thou-
sands had fallen victim that the urban population
was cowed. The Reagan administration in the
1980s gave $6 billion in aid and by lobbying for
land reform hoped to undercut support for theguerrillas and to promote democracy. But Duartedid not solve the political or economic problems of
El Salvador and the Marxist-led guerrillas provided
evidence of their ability to strike by knocking out
nearly all the electricity supplies on the eve of the
congressional elections in 1988. People who bothered to vote turned to the right. The smallcountry was ravaged by civil war, which by the
early 1990s had claimed at least 70,000 lives, and
by left-wing and right-wing terror. Almost half the
population was unemployed. Duarte, on whomWashington’s hopes rested, was terminally ill fromcancer and his influence weakened. He was
replaced in the election of June 1989 by Alfredo
Cristiani, the candidate of the extreme right-wingparty. Guerrilla terrorism and right-wing deathsquads continued to abuse human rights. Despitesubstantial US economic and military aid, the
future for El Salvador remained as uncertain as
ever, though the outgoing UN secretary general
Javier Pérez de Cuellar brokered a peace plan inDecember 1991. On 1 February 1992, a peaceagreement was concluded that promised reforms
and UN-supervised elections in 1994. Peace, trade
and democracy have changed El Salvador’s for-

tunes. The free-market reforms of the conservative
Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena) and thepegging of the local currency to the US dollar haveled to steady growth and low inﬂation, though

austerity and readjustment, too, have been painful.
Unlike in Argentina, these reform policies have
worked and democratic government in the earlytwenty-ﬁrst century is more secure, a stabilisinginﬂuence in Central America.NicaraguaIn Nicaragua Washington saw the greatest chal-
lenge to US interests in the 1980s and to Latin
American progress towards constitutional demo-
cratic governments. The Marxist state that
emerged after 1979, which was hostile to privateenterprise and nationalised foreign-owned inter-ests, also faced severe economic problems. They
were in part due to the economic embargoes of
the US, which could not be fully compensated for
by trade with Europe or loans from sources notunder the control of the US; they were also dueto the inefﬁciency of planned socialist economies,
as evidenced, for example, in Cuba.Nicaragua is the most thinly populated state inCentral America, with the lowest per-capita
income after Honduras, at $830 in 1987. Here,too, can be found the link between the domin-ance of coffee and bananas as Nicaragua’s princi-
pal exports, until disease in the 1930s devastated
the crop, and the gross disparity of wealth
between the few plantation owners and merchantsand a landless peasantry, the largest in CentralAmerica. Diversification into beef, cotton and
sugar in the 1960s could not compensate for the
low income from agricultural exports and the710LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
declining terms of trade (commodity exportprices rising more slowly or falling, as againstrising costs of manufactured imports and, in the
1970s, the rising cost of oil). On such a social and
economic basis, democracy could not be built up;
on the contrary, deprivation and extremes ofwealth and poverty provided the soil for revoltand savage repression.Nicaragua has traditionally been an area of USconcern. When disorder and foreign financial
claims threatened it in 1912, US marines moved
in and did not ﬁnally leave until January 1933. Bythen they had had to cope with a nationalist back-lash. Augusto César Sandino led a guerrilla cam-
paign against them and against the Nicaraguan
government they were supporting. He was tricked
into taking part in negotiations by the Nicaraguanleaders whom the marines had left behind inpower, and in 1934 he was murdered by the
Nicaraguan National Guard. Sandino was a liberal
reformist and patriot, and now he became a
martyr, a powerful symbol whose name andmantle the Marxist Sandinistas appropriated intheir struggles during the 1970s against the rule
of the Somoza family.The Somozas had established a dynasty inNicaragua. In the 1930s power in the country was
wielded by the National Guard, which had beenorganised by the US to maintain internal security.At its head was General Anastaslo Somoza Garcia.
The constitutional institutions were a façade
behind which the National Guard operated. In
1937 Somoza made himself president and ruledthe country for the next nineteen years, until hewas assassinated in 1956. His authoritarian rule
became notorious for corruption, nepotism and
repression. This was not a turn of events
Washington had anticipated when creating the
supposedly non-political National Guard, butdefence of constitutional proprieties was not highon Washington’s list of priorities, as long as US
interests were safeguarded. Somoza’s National
Guard was preferable to having to send in US
marines. Somoza took care not to offend USinterests and aligned Nicaragua as a dependentand reliable US ally. He was also adept at manip-
ulating the political and landed interests at home.
In the division of spoils, the National Guard werepampered, and plantation owners and merchantswere allowed to reap unhindered the proﬁts oftheir enterprises. This left the vast majority of the
population in wretched poverty, illiterate and
with no hope for the future. On Somoza’s assas-
sination his eldest son Luis took over the presi-dency and the younger son, Anastasio Jr, assumedcommand of the National Guard. The 1950s and
1960s were relatively peaceful in Nicaragua, a
period of diversiﬁcation into cotton and other
crops; a small but growing middle class began to
emerge with the help of Alliance dollars, andsome economic progress was achieved. But forthe peasants the expansion of cotton-growing
meant displacement from the land.Luis was the ‘weakest’ of the Somozas, and in 1967 Anastasio assumed the presidency.Nicaragua’s most bloody and repressive decadenow began. Anastasio made no pretence of ruling
as a politician. He used the naked power of the
National Guard, employing murder and torture
to crush the growing opposition. When a devas-tating earthquake in 1972 all but destroyedManagua, Nixon sent large-scale aid. It did not
reach the victims; only half of it could be
accounted for by the Nicaraguan treasury.
Corruption was rife, and for a time the National
Guard could keep order only with US help.Reconstruction after the earthquake benefitedmainly Somoza’s supporters, not the poor. The
guerrilla war ﬂared up and National Guard atroc-
ities perpetrated in repressing the guerrillas out-
raged the Church. Human-rights abuses werenow affecting American support. There wasgrowing opposition in the US to providing
dollars in support of ruthless dictators, yet even
under President Carter military aid continued to
be granted to Somoza, since the alternative of a
Marxist-led Nicaragua was regarded as totallyunacceptable. But the abuses of Somoza and hisNational Guard, worldwide condemnation and
the evident crumbling of Somoza’s power left the
Carter administration little alternative but to
abandon all support for the regime by the springof 1979. A few weeks later, in July, Somoza wasoverthrown by the broad opposition coalition of
guerrillas, the Sandinista National Liberation
Front (FSLN).1CENTRAL AMERICA IN REVOLUTION711
The abuses of the Somoza family, their amass-
ing of enormous wealth and the general corruptionhad made them many enemies, especially among
those who had not shared the spoils. These groups
ranged from the right, conservatives opposed to
any genuine democratic reform, through to the
professional and mercantile middle sectors, and 
to the socialists and Marxists. It was an alliance of
the left that formed the ﬁrst guerrilla groups of the

1960s, recruiting support from peasants and stu-

dents. The corruption and repression following on
the Managuan earthquake of 1972 broadened 
the opposition. After the assassination in 1978 of
the respected editor of the leading newspaper in
Nicaragua, La Prensa, the middle class and conser-
vatives were ready to support armed oppositionagainst Somoza. FSLN forces with Cuban help
were now well organised and, in a series of attacks,
demoralised the National Guard and seized power
on 19 July 1979. Somoza ﬂed the country.
The revolutionary junta was dominated by the Marxist–Leninist leadership from the start.
Decision-making was collective. FSLN’s most
inﬂuential ﬁgures were the hardline Tomás Borge
Martinez and the two brothers Humberto Ortega
and Daniel Ortega. The junta was more prag-
matic than most communist regimes, permitting
some degree of political plurality and private own-
ership. But it was equally determined on theLeninist Soviet model to retain real power andbuild a socialist society. The National Assembly
reﬂected the ﬁrm control the junta exercised over
the country through the revolutionary party, the
army and the state security services. Until its
closure in 1986, La Prensaremained a lone voicein opposition. Throughout the country there was
censorship and control of the domestic media.
During the 1980s, splits began to occur among
the junta. The more moderate coalition partners
of the original Council of State went into exile,
leaving the country under the domination of the
FSLN. In exile also were remnants of Somoza’s
National Guard and dissidents from FSLN’sregime. Together they formed disparate guerrillabands on Nicaragua’s borders, the so-called
Contras, who, with the help of supplies from the
US, waged a guerrilla war against the Sandinistas.Within Nicaragua the junta did not honour itscommitment in 1979 to establish a democracy, butpostponed elections until its power was consoli-

dated in 1984. Daniel Ortega became president.
By adopting a programme of reforms from above,
and by mobilising nationalist feelings against theUS and its support for the Contras, the junta wasable to dominate Nicaragua for a decade, backed
by the powerful party and security apparatus. The
main opposition refused to participate in elections
before 1990. In health care, housing and particu-

larly education, the Sandinistas neverthelessachieved progress. State planning and land reformswere instituted more gradually. But the combina-

tion of the effects of the civil war, the huge
resources devoted to building up a large army to
ﬁght the US-backed Contras and US economicembargoes devastated the Nicaraguan economy.Only the limited Soviet and European assistance
enabled the Sandinistas to survive. But Moscow’s
own economic troubles led to a cut in aid, and the
Soviet–US rapprochement forced Daniel Ortegaand the Sandinista leadership to modify their poli-
cies and invite a more genuine popular mandate
through free elections. At the same time, despite
Reagan’s strong support, the Contras were being
denied essential war supplies by the US Congress’s
refusal to supply the funds.These conditions provided an opportunity forthe long-drawn-out peace negotiations sponsored
by Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela,
whose presidents met on the island of Contadora
in the early 1980s, and then by Costa Rica’s president. Arias Sánchez’s peace plan was signedby the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in August
1987 and earned Arias Sánchez the Nobel Peace
Prize. It called for regional ceaseﬁres in all the
guerrilla wars, democratic reforms and the endingof foreign support for the rebels. It marked anattempt by the Central American leaders to solve
their own problems without outside interfer-
ence. In Washington, the Reagan administration
greeted the peace plan with scepticism and suspi-cion. It was difﬁcult to believe that the Sandinistaleadership had any other motive but to persuade
the US Congress that the US administration’s
support for the Contras was an obstacle to peace;712LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
then, with Contra pressure removed, theSandinistas would be able to rule with impunity.As it turned out, Arias Sánchez’s optimism,
despite many setbacks, proved at least partially
justiﬁed. Daniel Ortega had changed: he was no
longer the Marxist–Leninist revolutionary leaderdetermined to build a socialist Nicaragua at allcosts. The failures in Nicaragua were all too
obvious. Daniel Ortega now took the lead in fol-
lowing the perestroikaline. In April 1990, freeelections were held in Nicaragua and the opposi-
tion won, to the surprise of the Sandinistas.Ortega handed over power peacefully to VioletaChamorro. Violeta Chamorro, in turn, followed
a policy of reconciliation acceptable ﬁrst of all to
the Sandinistas, who were allowed to retain
command of the army, and acceptable in the endto the Contras as well, who abandoned the armedstruggle. At least for war-shattered Nicaragua 
the future began to look a little more hopeful 
as the guerrillas gave up the armed struggle. But
the economy remained in dire straits, with almosthalf the population unemployed.Latin America after the early 1960s experi-
enced accelerating economic and social change.
Its traditional power structures adapted by
increasing reliance on military force and repres-
sion, or they shared power with other sectors ofsociety but still placed reliance on the military tocheck organised peasant and urban labour groups,
as happened in Brazil. Socialist alternatives were
never able to retain power; the hostility of the US
ensured support for anti-socialist oppositionforces in Guatemala (1954), the DominicanRepublic (1965), Chile (1973), Grenada (1983)
and, ﬁnally, Nicaragua. The Soviet Union was in
no position to challenge the US effectively in the
Western hemisphere.During the 1980s, Latin American politicaldevelopments came to seem more in conformitywith Western hopes and American intentions.
Military regimes receded in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,
Uruguay and Brazil. Colombia, Venezuela and
Costa Rica were already ruled by civilian govern-
ments. Indirectly the US helped to bring about thefall of the military junta in Argentina. By providing
intelligence to London, crucial assistance was 
given to Britain’s recapture of the Falklands in1982, a blow the junta could not survive. In theCaribbean, the worst of the dictators, Duvalier,had been forced from Haiti into exile (1986); the
leftist regime in Grenada, which had lapsed into
murderous inﬁghting, was eliminated by a US
invasion in 1983, to the evident relief of the localpopulation, but to the embarrassment of Britain, as Grenada was a member of the Commonwealth.
What had led the Reagan administration to inter-

vene was its determination to halt the spread of
Cuban inﬂuence. After a long struggle and despite
many setbacks, US policies also succeeded in mak-
ing authoritarian Marxist rule by the Sandinistasuntenable. US policies in Central America and the
Caribbean in the 1980s were an update of the
Monroe Doctrine.PanamaThe US has continued since the Spanish–American
War of 1898 to occupy the Guántanamo navalbase in Cuba. And ever since Alfred ThayerMahan highlighted the crucial strategic import-
ance of a transisthmian canal in the 1890s, the US
was determined to assure itself of predominant
inﬂuence in Panama and to exercise sovereign
control over any canal that might be constructed.In 1903, ardent Panamanian nationalism againstColombian rule provided the opportunity. The
US helped the Panamanian revolution but exacted
a price: control of the future canal. Herein lies the
crux of Panamanian history in the twentieth cen-tury. Ostensibly independent and sovereign,Panama was little more than a US colony for six
decades. Panamanian nationalism was inﬂamed 
by the country’s lack of sovereignty in the Canal
Zone and by the extensive rights the US exercised
over its economy and its foreign policy. It wasruled by a wealthy and corrupt oligarchy of thekind common in Latin America but one that was
also required to accept a client relationship with
the US. If popular riots occurred, US troops inter-
vened to suppress them. In Panama too, theUnited Fruit Company enjoyed extensive land andrights. Payments made by the US for use of the
Canal Zone were an important prop for the econ-
omy, at times providing a third of Panama’s1CENTRAL AMERICA IN REVOLUTION713
national income (bananas and sugar are otherimportant resources). President Roosevelt’s
attempts to construct a ‘good neighbour’ policy
could not convincingly reconcile Panamaniannationalism, resurgent in the 1930s, and US inter-ests. The 1936 Canal Treaty was wonderfully
ambiguous. ‘The Canal zone’, it stated, ‘is terri-
tory of the Republic of Panama under the juris-
diction of the US.’ In the 1950s and 1960spopular resentment against the US grew, and1964 saw widespread riots.After 1968 the political oligarchs lost power toPanama’s National Guard. Any pretence at even a
corrupt democratic constitutional process was
abandoned and General Omar Torrijos emergedas the undisputed authoritarian leader. He inau-gurated harsh labour laws but also a radical pro-
gramme of land reform with a populist promise
that he would help the poor. He also gained sup-
port by adopting a stridently nationalist stance onthe issue of the US-controlled canal and canalzone. After thirteen years of negotiating with suc-
cessive US administrations, carefully controlling
the pressure of mass nationalism and anti-
American feeling, Torrijos in 1977 concluded a
new canal treaty with the Carter administration,which was ratiﬁed by the US Senate in the follow-ing year only with considerable difﬁculty and the
addition of reservations. In stages the canal passed
under the control of Panama in 2000. Yet the US
is guaranteed passage of the canal in perpetuity forits merchant ships and warships, and it is entitledto use force to protect these rights after the year
2000 if Panamanian troops fail to do so. Panama
secured something less than total sovereignty.The 1980s saw the nadir of Panamanian–USrelations. Torrijos died in an air crash in 1981,
which may have been arranged. General Manuel
Noriega, an unscrupulous and brutal soldier, soon took his place. He had been recruited by the CIA, which was anxious to make use of his
contacts to uncover the drug trade passing 
from Colombia to Panama and on to the US.
Embarrassingly, Noriega himself drew hugeproﬁts from the drug trade; indeed, in corruptionand brutality no previous Panamanian dictator
compared. He transformed the National Guard
into the Panama Defence Forces, with new
powers, to act as his tool of repression. Even so,
GNP per capita (the population was 2.3 million)rose to $2,240 in 1987. The elections of 1984,which allowed his nominee to become president,
were a farce. The US now tried to rid Panama of
the general. In 1988, Noriega was indicted for
drug trafficking in the US. He countered bybeating the anti-American nationalist drum.President Reagan’s pressure and economic sanc-
tions were not enough to topple him, nor two
attempted military coups which enjoyed US
goodwill. In May 1989 Noriega held elections
again, but when the leader of the opposition,Guillermo Endara, gathered most votes despiteintimidation from Noriega’s thugs, the results
were falsiﬁed. On 20 December 1989, President
Bush cut the Gordian knot and 24,000 US troops
descended on Panama City to arrest and over-throw Noriega. He ﬂed to the Embassy of theVatican but gave himself up in January 1990. He
was tried and sent to prison. Guillermo Endara
was installed as president of Panama.714LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED

MexicoThe hemispheric role of the US was also deeplyresented in Mexico. Yet no country was moredependent on the US economically. Within the
Organisation of American States, Marxist Cuba
and Nicaragua had in Mexico their only sup-

porter. Mexico had made its own revolutionalready in 1911. The country had good reason tobear animosity toward her US neighbour having
lost half her territory to her in 1848. Mexico then
suffered a French occupation (1863–7) and only
gained some stability in 1876 when GeneralPorﬁrio Díaz seized power and ruled the countryfor thirty-ﬁve years until 1911. There was spec-
tacular economic progress during these years; a
wealthy small Creole upper class modelled their
life-style on Europe. The less fortunate masses of
landless native American peasants worked on theHaciendas of large landowners. Díaz could relyfor support on the Church and the bayonet.
Sweat-shops and textile mills employed labourers
at low wages.A split among the ruling oligarchy ushered in the Revolution. Díaz was overthrown in 1911,and a liberal minded president was elected. But
the fall of Díaz started renewed conﬂict and civil
war. The hero of the Revolution was Emiliano
Zapata, who led a peasant army on his white
charger and became the romantic martyr. Civilwar raged against the new dictator GeneralVictoriano Huerta in the presidential palace, a
ﬂamboyant former cattle rustler, Pancho Villa led
a small but well-trained force of mercenaries.
Then in 1914 Huerta faced a third foe. WoodrowWilson sent in the marines and Huerta ﬂed. Theoutcome of the Mexican Revolution remained in
doubt until 1923. By then both Villa and Zapata
had been killed by government forces.Despite the socialist rhetoric of the Mexicanconstitution, reform would be instituted fromabove – peasants and workers were not to becomethe arbiters of power. There were to be no revo-
lutionary social upheavals. The secularisation of
the state and the expropriation of Church wealth
were important outcomes of the revolution. Analliance between the military, the wealthy and the middle class consolidated the powers of thepresidents, and their followers were rewarded by the spoils of ofﬁce. But the difference betweenMexico and other Latin American countries is
that an effective party organisation, renamed sev-
eral times and since 1945 called the Partido
Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), controls thecountry and embraces workers and peasants aswell as the rising middle-income groups. Lázaro
Cárdenas, president from 1934 to 1940, devel-
oped a corporate state in which each section of
the population, workers, peasants, the military,
the middle class, was placed under the partyumbrella as groups rather than as individuals.Through large-scale land distribution Cárdenas
carried forward one of the principal aims of 
the revolution, breaking up the haciendas and
granting the land as private plots or joint peas-ant farms; another aim was to take control ofMexico’s major resources, the most important 
of which was oil. Cárdenas nationalised the largely
US-owned oil companies. Dissatisﬁed with the
compensation received, but even more disturbedthat other countries might follow Mexico’sexample, the international oil companies boy-

cotted her oil and inhibited development of 
the state oil company until uncertainties in the
Middle East after the Second World War made
Mexican oil too valuable a Western resource notto be utilised.Westerners regarded Mexico as a truly revolu-tionary country for a number of reasons: the
attack on the Church, the ofﬁcial government

espousal of atheism, nationalisation, reformswhich hurt the wealthy landowners, the propaga-tion of the myth of a peasants’ and workers’ 
revolution and admiration for Marx and Lenin,
the assertion of a Mexican identity and pride in
her native American roots, immortalised by the
political–historical murals of Mexico’s mostfamous artist, Diego Rivera, and the granting ofasylum to Leon Trotsky. In fact Mexico con-

formed far more closely to Latin American pat-
terns than to the Soviet model. In any case 
the authoritarian state was not exclusive to theSoviet Union but was common among the fascistnations of Europe in the 1930s. Private property
in the early 1990s remained the source of great
wealth in Mexico for a minority, while poverty1CENTRAL AMERICA IN REVOLUTION715
was the lot of the peasants and the urban masses,the high birth rate undermining efforts to raiseliving standards. Mexico too had seen extensive
migration from country to city. In ten years, from
1970 to 1980, Mexico City increased its popula-
tion by 7 million to 15 million, with a huge mar-ginalised population living in shanty slums. Thepopulation of the country as a whole grew from
25.8 million in 1950 to 34.9 million in 1960, to
84.6 million in 1989 (by which year the gross
per-capita income was US $2,010).The Mexican state is a conglomeration of ele-ments of socialism, state planning and a constitu-tional electoral process. Mexico enjoys a surfeit of
elections for mayors, governors, assemblies and
the president; some opposition parties are toler-
ated and compete. Presidential elections haveoccurred every six years, and the presidency hasalways changed hands peacefully, so the spoils are
regularly redistributed. But only one party, the
PRI, dominates and has decided the outcome 
of national and presidential elections. Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado, candidate of the PRI, waselected president in 1982 with a vote of over 74
per cent.Distribution of land to the campesinos, thepeasant owners of smallholdings, and revolution-
ary rhetoric kept the majority of peasants quiet asthe 1990s began, engaged in trying to make asubsistence living. The seasonal and illegal exodus
across the 2000-mile border into the United
States provided a safety valve for tens of thou-
sands of the poor. Even so, in urban areas wheremost Mexicans live, there was massive unemploy-ment. The well-to-do were surrounded by mass
poverty. The middle classes enjoyed the high
standard of living which the growth and diversi-
ﬁcation of the Mexican economy had made pos-
sible, while the spoils of office were used toensure a faithful following for the incumbentpresident and the dominant PRI party. There was
more freedom in Mexico than in many Latin
American states, but it was carefully controlled.
Most sections of the population tended to accepttheir lack of political inﬂuence. In any case thestate had a special security police, which, accord-
ing to Amnesty reports, in the early 1990s con-
tinued to employ torture and murder againstanyone considered to disturb Mexico’s politicalorder. In Mexico too, hundreds ‘disappeared’,but repression was not on the same vast scale as
Argentina or Chile experienced. Mexican stability
rested for four decades on a revolutionary myth
and authoritarian conservative control.Below the surface, the rapid economic changescaused dissatisfaction with the authoritarian style
of government to grow. During the Olympic
Games in 1968, widespread student protest led 
to the killings of hundreds in Mexico City and
attracted worldwide attention. In the early 1970sguerrilla bands appeared but were suppressed bythe security services. With the enormous increases
in oil prices engineered by OPEC (of which
Mexico was not a member) and new oil discov-
eries, export earnings after 1975 increased tentimes to US$20 billion. But lavish expenditureand ambitious development resulted in high 
inﬂation. The end of the oil boom in the 1980s
and worldwide economic stagnation burst the
Mexican bubble. Heavy foreign borrowing andausterity programmes drastically reduced stan-
dards of living, while the birth rate, if it contin-
ued unabated, would double the population every
twenty years; and half the population was under
sixteen years of age. Mexico was saddled with one
of the largest foreign debts in the world, whosepayment had to be periodically rescheduled; thebankers demanded austerity and Mexico found
itself caught between trying to satisfy inter-
national ﬁnanciers by making economies, while
trying to prevent internal unrest as a result ofpolicies imposed externally. The inability of theregime to cope effectively with the catastrophic
earthquake that hit Mexico City in September
1985 added to a loss of credibility, which was
compounded by Mexico’s economic crises. The
stability maintained by the political system beganto look increasingly fragile. The right-wing oppo-sition Partido de Acción Nacional (PAN) claim-
ed massive electoral fraud, but the ruling PRI 
made few concessions. Despite misgivings about
the undemocratic nature of Mexican politics,Washington saw a greater danger in further desta-bilising Mexico and provided ﬁnancial support. In
the 1988 presidential elections the PRI candidate,
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, claimed to have won.716LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED
There was fraud on a colossal scale, but the PRImonopoly of power had been broken in theMexican Congress. Nevertheless, the PRI Presi-
dent remained ﬁrmly in power and an economic
austerity programme was instituted. But for the
ﬁrst time in many decades there were indicationsof future political changes.In 1961, Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress wasto have been the starting point for the transfor-
mation of Latin America. The cycle of depriva-
tion, economic and social injustice was to have
been broken and Latin American societies were tohave started on the road to political democraticreform. Over thirty years later the problems of the
continent were still daunting. Population growth
outstripped development. The danger of Marxist
revolution had been contained, but terrorism andrepression continued. The root causes of instabil-ity had not been removed. The immigration from
the countryside had swollen the shanty towns that
surrounded the fashionable streets of the wealthy.
Everywhere there were thousands of childrenbegging, stealing or offering themselves for pros-titution. Mexico City served as but one example
of their plight. The pependores, or rubbish pickers(10,000 of them), made the City’s three huge
rubbish dumps their home. Even here they were
exploited by ‘bosses’ who made their money outof the refuse that could be recycled.By turning to a market economy, privatisingand liberalising trade with the expected coming
into operation of a free-trade region comprising
herself, the United States and Canada, Mexicohoped in the 1990s to create her own economicmiracle. Many companies were privatised and in
1990/1 a good growth rate was achieved, while
inﬂation, which in 1987 ran at 160 per cent, was
slashed in 1992 to 12 per cent. Foreign debts
were reduced and foreign investment began toreturn. Salinas toured the country and wonsupport among the peasantry. He used proceeds
from the sale of state-owned companies to build
schools, to link rural communities with the elec-
tricity network and to ensure that clean drinkingwater was available. More than 1200 health clinicswere opened in 1991 to serve the people. Huge
problems remained. Carlos Salinas de Gortari
declared that his aim during his six-year term ofofﬁce as president from 1988 to 1994 was to takeMexico from Third World to First World status.During the ﬁrst years of his presidency he made
a dynamic start.There were at last some hopeful indications ofchange in Latin America in the 1990s. A numberof countries were determinedly trying to turn the
economic corner and make a start on raising 
the standard of living of the most deprived.The enormous level of Latin American debt,which had risen from $68 billion in 1975 to $410billion in 1987, threatened to cripple effortstowards further investment and development.
But, unable to recover all of it, the West agreed 
to write a portion of it off. Western institutions
such as the International Monetary Fund insistedon the medicine of austerity and better economicmanagement, which Mexico had to accept in
order to attract new funds. Among left-wing guer-
rilla movements there was a collapse of morale 
following the demise of the Soviet Union. All butMarxist fanatics were ready to end the ﬁghting andto exchange the riﬂe for the ballot box. Civilian-
elected governments and multi-party parliaments
became the norm. It was not democracy, but it
was progress, a move away from tyrannical and
authoritarian regimes.Even so, there was no guarantee that demo-cratic representative institutions could long
survive economic mismanagement, as the example
of Peru showed in 1992. Democracy cannot be
divorced from social and economic progress. Itcan not take ﬁrm root unless the needs of thepoor are also met. When elected ofﬁcials accept
that their power derives from the people and not
just from the nation’s elite, true democracy can
be established.Widespread corruption still plagued LatinAmerica in the last decade of the twentiethcentury. Birth rates still tended to be too high,
though they were dropping in Argentina, Chile,
Brazil and Mexico. High birth rates meant that
even countries on the path of economic reformwould be faced with increasing poverty. The distribution of wealth, or rather lack of it, to 
the poor majority scarcely diminished the gap
between rich and the poor. The statistics for1CENTRAL AMERICA IN REVOLUTION717
income per head of population obscure thisbecause they are averages: the poor were muchworse off than the average. Simply absorbing the
young and providing some employment for them
when nearly half the population was aged under
twenty was a formidable problem. Urbanisationand the growth of mega-million cities magniﬁedthe problem. The power base of the energeticpolitical leaders of Latin America was fragile and
their austerity policies to cure inflation were
deeply unpopular. The leaders themselves were all
too often tempted by the fruits of ofﬁce.718LATIN AMERICA AFTER 1945: PROBLEMS UNRESOLVED

AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICTAND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
For a British university graduate in the early1950s, the Colonial Service offered a ﬁne oppor-
tunity for a fulﬁlling and worthwhile career. After
a brief apprenticeship, in his late twenties or earlythirties, he could expect to become a district com-missioner in the Fiji Islands or an African colony
and to be given responsibility for thousands of
‘natives’ as the ultimate magistrate and authority
on the spot. Such opportunities for young 
men to exercise paternalistic power did not exist in the Western world. The only drawback ofColonial Service was the question of marriage, or
more accurately the problem of how a single white
male might ﬁnd a suitable wife to take to the bush.
Marrying locally was impractical; there were few, ifany unattached white girls, and an interracial mar-riage was unthinkable. Fulﬁlment of this basic
human need therefore had to be arranged rather
rapidly on a spell of leave back home; the district
commissioner’s wife thereafter fulﬁlled an import-
ant role in the white colonial society, which had its strict pecking order from the governor and hiswife downwards. On the surface, little had
changed for half a century in the customs and
mores of colonial government and the same held
true for the French. A career in the colonies was acareer for life. But then, little more than ten yearslater, it all came suddenly to an end. District com-
missioners are no more. Black Africa asserted its
political independence in country after country.The story of the demise of the colonial civilservant, a mere microcosm of history, has a widerbearing; it illustrates a phenomenon historianscan repeatedly observe. Major upheavals often
occur abruptly, surprising contemporaries with
their speed and dynamism. It is historians – them-selves actually no better than anyone else at antici-pating the future – who later analyse how changes
have been gradually in the making over a period
of decades.As empires go, European rule over most of theAfrican continent was of relatively short duration;apart from forts and territories on the coast, polit-ical empire began much later than in Asia and the
Americas and ended sooner. Economic empire
was, however, older. Europe’s interest in Africa
was predominantly economic long before parti-tion in the latter part of the nineteenth century.The Europeans replaced the Arabs in linking
Africa’s produce with the rest of the world. Until
the nineteenth century the most important
African product was human beings – slaves. Other
resources were harnessed to serve Western needsin the world economy. From an African perspec-tive the dominant theme is white exploitation. But
eventual Western political control also led to the
imposition of a new order, the creation of embry-
onic nations. These took the form of Europeancolonies with internationally agreed frontiers, andthey were opened to the inﬂux of Western ideas of
government, which included the doctrine of self-
determination. The supplanting of the African
means of exchange by European money and theintroduction of market economies, roads and1Chapter 63THE END OF WHITE RULE IN WEST AFRICAinfrastructures and capital investment transformedtraditional African societies. Over the course ofthree generations the continent evolved into
numerous independent nation states. Within them
tribal and cultural divisions continue to cause ten-
sion and conflict; colonial national boundarieswere not everywhere willingly accepted in thepost-colonial era. In Nigeria and the Congo there
was civil war in the 1960s and in the Horn of
Africa – Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia – devastat-
ing ﬁghting continued for decades. Nevertheless
the pre- and post-independence maps of dividedAfrica have remained remarkably similar.The boundaries drawn by the British, French,Belgians, Germans, Spaniards and Portuguese in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
reﬂected penetration by missionaries and traders,the strategic and political interests of govern-
ments in Europe or of enterprising colonialists in
Africa and the outcome of their rivalries. They did
not coincide with any natural geographical, ethnic
or tribal divisions.The diversity of the fifty-odd countries socreated is extraordinary, ranging from the im-
mense to the tiny, from those rich in resources 
to the desperately poor. The great religious divide
between Islam in the north and north-west and
Christianity further south splits Nigeria, theSudan and Ethiopia. The new African countrieswere also divided ideologically, between Marxist
Mozambique, for example, and the feudal
kingdom of Ethiopia. It is remarkable how little
ﬁghting there has been over the many colonialfrontiers between the new African nations. Plansfor a powerful ‘Pan-Africa’, such as was urged by
the charismatic Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s (the
Gold Coast’s) first leader after independence,
proved completely unrealistic. The transfers of
power created new ruling groups and leaders whowished to exercise authority in their own coun-tries and were, with few exceptions, unwilling to
contemplate fusing with others.The voice of independent Africa as a whole isa regional international organisation made up ofsovereign nations, the Organisation of AfricanUnity (OAU), created in 1963 and modelled on
the United Nations. In the new millennium its
successor is the African Union, which is no morecohesive. The divisiveness of independent Africahas not made it an inﬂuential or effective body.Its main effort was to work for the completion of
liberation, the decolonisation of those parts of
Africa still under European rule, and to defend
black rights where they were being denied, as inSouth Africa. It provided a means of mediation ininter-African disputes but accepted the principle
of non-interference in the internal affairs of the
sovereign states. The inherited colonial frontiers
were speciﬁcally recognised by the OAU at its
second meeting in Cairo in 1964. Could theyhave acted otherwise?Given the artiﬁciality of the colonial Africanfrontiers, to have attempted to redraw them
would have invited chaos. Nor, as in the Balkans,
could viable nations based simply on tribal iden-tities be formed without subdividing the conti-nent into hundreds of parcels. The principle of
self-determination thus took second place in fash-
ioning the political shape of independent Africa.
The colonial era created ‘facts’ – the clock couldno longer be turned back. Even Nkrumah had toaccept this. The conﬂicts in Africa thus became
internal, civil conﬂicts within existing states, an
ethnic group ﬁghting for independence, such as
the Ibo revolt in Nigeria or the long Eritrean
struggle against the Ethiopian state, or straight-forward civil war, as in Mozambique and Angola,former Portuguese colonies, where the strife was
for decades prolonged by outside interference.
Independent African countries also aided the
black population in what was Rhodesia to gainmajority rule. And Black Africa supported theblack majority in South Africa in its struggle for
equal rights. By the twenty-ﬁrst century Africa
had not yet found a continent-wide peace.The timing of independence was not primarilydetermined by the readiness of the colonies, bythe stage of economic, social and political devel-opment they had reached. The political complex-
ion of the governments in Europe, the perception
of their leaders, economic considerations as they
affected the mother country – all played a greaterrole. Crucial too was the differentiation betweencolonies with unhealthy climates as in West Africa
and those with temperate zones on the southern
coast or along the highland ridge running north722AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
from South Africa to what was Southern Rhodesia(Zimbabwe) or those where mineral wealth hadattracted European immigration.The white farming settler families, some ofwhom have been in Africa for generations, or the
Dutch, English and Indian immigrants who had
built up a modern industrial society as in SouthAfrica, the majority of them born in Africa, regardAfrica as their homeland too. The whites andAsians in South Africa constitute a large minority(whites about one in ﬁve, Asian rather less than
one in twenty-ﬁve, and of mixed race, the so-calledcoloureds, one in ten). There and in the Belgian
Congo (as formerly in Southern Rhodesia), the
whites owned most of the useful land and wealth.
A transfer of power, enabling the black majority torule the country, threatened the white Africans notonly with a loss of political power but also with

White resistance,with their control of the armed forces, especially if they were backed by the colonial power, as 
the French settlers were in Algeria, was an enor-

mous obstacle to independence with majority 
rule. The large increase of white settlers after the
Second World War, soaring in British Rhodesia
from 55,400 to 160,000, in Northern Rhodesia 
from 9,900 to 50,000, in Kenya from 18,000 to
42,000, in Portuguese Angola from 30,000 to
80,000, in Mozambique from 10,000 to 50,000
and in the Belgian Congo from 18,600 to 77,000,
created interest groups not easily set aside. Not 
surprisingly, the white settler colonies were the 
last to gain independence – Mozambique (1975),Angola (1975), Zimbabwe (1980), Namibia(1989) – while majority rule in South Africa in
1992 had not yet been established.In the colonies where the whites were mostnumerous the black majority resorted to arms. In
Algeria, Rhodesia, Angola and Mozambique
there was no bloodless transfer of power. The
history of European colonialism in the various
African countries and their emergence to inde-
pendence has some common features but is also
distinctive for each region and country.How can a balance sheet of European colonial-
ism in Africa be set out? The question is unanswer-

able. The link between Africa and the rest of theindustrialised world in the twentieth century was bound to bring about a transformation of
African society, African economic development
and, indeed, every aspect of African life. The ques-

tion might better be posed thus: how far did the
colonial era facilitate the transformation to the
beneﬁt of the African peoples? Education and tech-

nical training were one key aspect and both were
woefully inadequate, yet a base was created that
generally made rapid expansion possible after inde-

pendence. Medical advances and the control or
eradication of diseases were an obvious beneﬁt

derived from colonial administration. But undeni-

ably the main purpose of colonial rule was to proﬁt
from the links with Africa and to enhance theEuropean nation’s own wealth and power.
Missionaries and others too acted out of a sense of
genuine paternalism but in the last resort the livesof the African peoples were shaped by the eco-
nomic needs of the colonial power and by thepolitical, administrative, economic and social con-

ditions created by the interplay of European gov-

ernments, colonial bureaucracies, trading compan-
ies, merchants, white farming settlers, skilled white
professionals and workers. In this process, the
rivalries of the European nations and their respec-

tive strengths decided the geographical colonial
entity, not ethnic affinities or the vestiges of 
former African empires. These were obliterated.
The Africans were not a homogeneous group
either, but themselves varied in beliefs and in their
roles in society.When the Europeans expanded all over Africain the nineteenth century, African textiles, pottery,and weapons comparable to artefacts from 
pre-industrial societies were mismatched with
European market needs. Some were carried off to
London, Paris and Brussels as artistic curios and
housed in museums. Africa’s ‘export trade’ had
early on consisted of minerals, above all gold, and
agricultural produce, tobacco, salt, spices, cotton
and later palm oil from the Niger delta. Not all
agricultural produce was indigenous to Africa.
Cacao was introduced by missionaries in the
1860s and in the twentieth century became the
Gold Coast’s principal export. Manufacturing
industries in Europe found markets in the coloniesfor their goods, but except in South Africa no sub-stantial manufacturing industries developed in the
European colonies despite the abundance of cheap
black labour. The Europeans gained virtual
monopolies of trade; inland, with territorial occu-
pation, they replaced the African merchants who
had previously controlled trade to the coast. The
African capitalists who did emerge were few 
and were dependent on Europeans in powerful
trading-company monopolies. European capital
abroad was more proﬁtably invested in the boom-
ing white industrial societies of Europe and the
Americas, which were already technologically
advanced. Investment in Africa ﬂowed into rapidlyexpanding mineral and plantation resources thatrequired a large unskilled labour input and rela-
tively little skilled labour. Ideology and racism
played a role in this too. Black Africans, with few724AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
exceptions, were simply not considered capable oflearning technological skills: Europeans tended toregard them as more like children.But, in the last resort, neither prejudice norgovernment policies dictated African economic
development as decisively as the workings of a
global capitalist economy in the twentieth cen-tury. The dependence of the African economieson the West for their monetary system, credit and
development and for the nurturing of African
resources and trade was so well set by the time of
independence in the 1950s and 1960s that funda-
mental changes would have been difﬁcult to bringabout. Black Africa in the 1990s remained chieﬂyin the role of primary producer; attempts to create
self-sustaining growth through industrial produc-
tion, as in the West or in parts of Asia, had ended
in failure. But manufacture was increasing andbeginning to substitute manufactured imports.The primary products were restricted to two or
three in each country, so that African wealth con-
tinued to be largely dependent on the world prices
of these commodities, whether of oil as in Nigeria
and the Gabon or of phosphates and cacao inTogo or of diamonds and coffee in the CentralAfrican Republic. Meanwhile food production in
Africa had not kept pace with population growth;
in the 1980s and 1990s Ethiopia suffered from
terrible famines. Looking to the future, the spreadof AIDS was yet another devastating problemfaced by black Africa, whose own resources were
inadequate to cope with the crisis.The imperialist European nations were parsi-monious when it came to colonial expenditures.
The British, French and Portuguese relied onprivate finance, the great chartered companiessuch as the Niger Company and the British South
Africa Company, which in return for subjugating
and administrating stretches of Africa received
trade and land concessions in the conquered ter-ritories. The opening of Africa was accomplishedby force and by African manual labour. Nowhere
was this human exploitation conducted with
greater systematic cruelty than in King Leopold’s
personal ﬁef in the Congo. Here the creation ofan administration, of an infrastructure of roadsand of a labour force to collect rubber resulted in
torture and genocide. Even white Europe, usedto regarding black people as racially inferior, wasshocked when this state of affairs was revealedshortly before the First World War.But this was not an isolated instance. In theprocess of developing Africa’s resources, the Euro-
pean was not prepared to undertake the unskilledmanual work necessary to harvest plantations,extract ores from mines or construct the roads 
and railways to the coast. A conscripted force of
black people, in conditions at times worse than
slavery, created the foundations of modern Africa.
Feudal conditions of forced native service per-sisted in French West Africa as late as 1946. InSouth Africa, cash taxes could be paid by black
people only if they earned cash in the mines. Men
were recruited on contracts, running for a year or
other specified periods, and immigrant labourbecame a feature of African economic life. Thecontinent’s human reservoir was also used beyond
its shores. Africans were no longer sent across the
Atlantic to develop other continents; they were
used in the twentieth century to develop Africaand so created the proﬁt necessary for furtherdevelopment. But the ﬁnancial investment came
from outside Africa; the technological skills were
also almost entirely conﬁned to the white man,
which left black Africa dependent and weak.
Moreover, during two world wars Africans sup-plied soldiers in the internecine conﬂict of Europe.How then did the colonial powers view Africa’sfuture, how did they see the relationship between
the Africans and their conquerors? Would it for-
ever remain one of master and servant? TheEuropean enlightenment had expounded thenotion of human progress. Africans could not be
entirely excluded; they were after all a part of the
human family. But crude racialism divided this
family and its state of civilisation by ‘colour’ from
white to black, with ‘brown’ Indians at an inter-mediate stage. In the British Empire the whitepeople were regarded as ﬁt to rule themselves;
Indian independence was accepted before 1914 as
inevitable at some distant date; but, for black
people, the time when they could be consideredready was not even envisaged.After the First World War the German coloniesof German East Africa, South-West Africa, the
Kamerun and Togoland were divided as spoils1THE END OF WHITE RULE IN WEST AFRICA725
between Britain (German East Africa, renamedTanganyika), South Africa (German South-WestAfrica, later Namibia), France (most of Togo and
the Cameroons) and Belgium (Ruanda and Uru-
ndi, formerly part of German East Africa, and later
the independent countries of Rwanda and Bur-undi). But these territories were not supposed tobe regarded simply as colonies; they were placed
under the guardianship of the League of Nations
and ‘mandated’ to Britain, South Africa, France
and Belgium, who were to act as ‘trustees’ for the
advancement of their inhabitants. Their specialstatus did not, however, help them to advance toindependence sooner. Indeed, one of the man-

dated territories, Namibia, was among the last to
gain independence in 1989.A small number of Europeans controlledAfrica. They could only do so by leaving toAfricans – under European supervision, adminis-
tration and command – the task of managing their
fellow Africans. This was the model of ‘indirect
rule’. As the ﬁrst task was paciﬁcation, Europeanofﬁcers and black soldiers played a large role inAfrica. Later, Africans ﬁlled the lower administra-
tive positions in all the colonies; there were simply
not enough Europeans for the task. In the British
Gold Coast colony for example, less than 850
European ofﬁcials in the 1930s ﬁlled the senioradministrative, military, police and technical postsin a country of 4 million African inhabitants. This
meant that Africans had to be educated to ﬁll
clerkships and lower supervisory roles. Schools
were established, but even so in the 1930s lessthan two out of a hundred Africans received for-mal education and very few had the opportunity of
university training. Yet the Gold Coast was more
advanced in African education than the rest of
Africa. The situation improved in the 1950s, but
primary and even more so secondary educationwas open to only a small minority of Africans.The lack of African technical and professionaltraining before independence undermined any
chance of fast development afterwards and created
a small group of African politicians and soldiers inwhose hands real power lay. This was not the kindof society where democracy could strike roots.
The neglect by the colonisers of the Africans was
the consequence of a policy that was economicallyexploitive and which provided government on thecheap for the European colonial powers. Thoughthey recognised African needs after the Second
World War, European governments were slow to
effect fundamental improvements in the decade or
two before independence. In any case there wouldhave been more catching up to accomplish thanthere was time for. Their ideas about the future of
their colonies also differed.The French had established a hierarchical, highlycentralised and authoritarian form of administra-tion with African chiefs acting as executives, overseen by provincial commissioners and a 
governor-general who, in turn, was responsible to
the Colonial Ministry in Paris. The French fol-
lowed the doctrine that black Africans could beelevated to equality with white French citizensthrough education and acceptance of French civil-
isation, French beliefs and French attitudes. In
short, their ultimate aspiration was to become
indistinguishable from the French except by thecolour of their skin. They then acquired all therights and obligations of French citizens, includ-
ing being able to vote and to hold ministerial
ofﬁce. On the face of it this was an enlightened
ideology, but it had nothing to do with guiding
African colonies to their own independence. Thecapital of French Africa was Paris. The number ofAfricans who qualiﬁed for equal rights was kept
very small and the idea was that they would be
grateful enough to defend the virtue of a system 
so beneﬁcial for them as to distinguish them fromthe poor African masses. The objective then was‘assimilation’ not ‘independence’. When at the
famous Brazzaville Conference of French African
governors in January 1944 the ‘Free French’ dis-
cussed the future of French colonial Africa, there
were proposals for economic reforms, but not forindependence. De Gaulle afterwards spoke of afuture in which each of the peoples would develop
and administer themselves and later even govern
themselves – ‘later’ meant ‘much later’. There was
talk of some form of association and federationwith France; it was all very vague, and no Africanwas invited to attend.The impact of the Second World War and theemergence of an educated and well-to-do African726AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
leadership protesting against economic disadvan-
tages and voicing African grievances began tobring about change. In the Ivory Coast Felix
Houphouët-Boigny founded an African Demo-
cratic Party in 1946 which won widespread sup-

port, in large part ﬁred by the continuing system of
forced labour and low wages – that is, grievancesdirectly affecting African life. Meanwhile, French
governments were ready to abandon the more bla-

tant forms of centralised colonial control, to intro-

duce reforms in their colonial administration and
to allow more representation in the FrenchAssembly. The idea being propagated was internalautonomy in a French Union freely supported by
the African peoples. In fact, the Union was
intended to maintain and indeed strengthen eco-

nomic and political links between metropolitanFrance and French Africa, and indeed with thewhole French empire, now so unfashionable. The
vision was one of partnership in a common cause in
the service of a French Republic restored to great-

ness as a world power. It was never intended as anequal partnership. It proved an illusion that ledFrance and its former empire in Indo-China and
North Africa to much grief and bloodshed.
Independence was conceded only after bitter 
conﬂict. In black West Africa, however, unlike
Algeria, armed conﬂict was avoided, except in the
Cameroon. The transfer of power from the mid-1950s was peaceful and inevitable. But the setting
up of territorial assemblies with elected African
deputies, increased representation in the French
Assembly in Paris, and the establishment of a fed-
eral Grand Conseil for French West Africa to assistthe governor-generals, now renamed high com-

missioners, were no more than palliatives. Black
Africans remained second-class citizens. After
Ghana had become independent in 1957, with the
struggle in Algeria still at a crucial stage, de Gaullemarked his return to power in 1958 with an elab-
orate initiative: he devised a new constitutional
settlement. The French Union would now become
the French Community; its members would con-

tinue to receive French economic and technicalaid; the former French colonial territories wouldreceive internal autonomy and titular independ-

ence but would still be tied to Paris. The French
Community was submitted to a referendum in theFrench colonial territories in November 1958. Aseconomic aid was still indispensable, all but oneWest African state, Guinea, voted to approve the
Community and to remain within it. But during
1959 and 1960 the African governing elites all
demanded complete independence, and Paris hadto accept that its efforts to maintain imperial polit-
ical control in ever more ingenious guises had
failed: the remaining black African nations of for-

mer French West and Equatorial Africa were
granted independence in 1960.The Côte D’Ivoire, the most populous of theformer French territories, was economically betteroff in the early 1990s as an independent country,
though it was still impoverished by Western stan-
dards. In the 1930s agricultural development had
been rapid, and cacao, coffee and palm oil becamethe chief export crops. As the 1990s began, theIvory Coast was a one-party state and had been
ruled since independence in 1960 by French-
educated Felix Houphouët-Boigny, formerly a
minister in Paris and a member of the Assemblywho had abandoned his early adherence to com-munism. Economically the Ivory Coast advanced
and diversified as the pragmatic Houphouët-
Boigny welcomed Western capital and French aid
and associated the country closely with France.
Eighty-seven years old in 1992, he no longerenjoyed reverential respect. The fall of the pricesof cocoa and coffee had had an adverse effect on
the economy, and servicing the foreign debt swal-
lowed up a sizeable proportion of export earn-
ings. Economic conditions rapidly deteriorated. Anew generation of students, teachers, profession-als and trade unionists was no longer prepared to
accept meekly the rule of the ‘fathers of the
nation’, the corruption and one-party states. The
West became dominant on the continent fol-
lowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, andHouphouët-Boigny had to make the gesture ofallowing for the ﬁrst time in October 1990 a con-
tested presidential election. His control of the
levers of power until his death in 1994 ensured
victory, but that did not end demands for a tran-sition to a broader sharing of power and spoils.Like Nkrumah, Houphouët-Boigny wastedmillions on imposing architecture in his poor
country. The capital boasts the famous basilica1THE END OF WHITE RULE IN WEST AFRICA727
modelled on St Peter’s in Rome with space for18,000 people. It was (reluctantly) consecratedby Pope John Paul II in 1990. It is not easy to
assess which is the worst region of misrule and
conﬂict, too many qualify. The Côte D’Ivoire,
once stable, was rent by civil war in the new mil-lennium. French troops and peacekeepers fromWest Africa imposed an armed separation and
mediated a shaky peace deal in 2003; this did not
halt sporadic ﬁghting. Over a million people out
of the population of sixteen million ﬂed from
their homes contributing to yet another human-itarian tragedy.Guinea was also a one-party state until the mil-itary took over in 1984. But, in contrast to the
Ivory Coast, it began independence by cutting its
ties with France in 1958. The strongman ofGuinea and its leader for decades was SékouTouré, who had built up his support through the
trade union movement. He erected an authori-
tarian state and adopted an African Marxism,
though rejecting the basic tenet of the class strug-gle. What he took from communism was thehighly organised one-party state, and his harsh
regime drove hordes of refugees into neighbour-
ing countries, estimated at between 1 and 2
million. At one time it looked as if Guinea would
fall into the Soviet orbit, but Sékou Touré was apassionate African nationalist, ready to accept aidfrom all sides and adjusting his relationships with
West and East to suit his perception of Guinea’s
national interests. Potentially rich in mineral
deposits, especially of bauxite for aluminium,Guinea by the 1990s had earned too little fromtheir export. The Russians, who developed the
extraction of bauxite, paid a low price and Guinea
remained at the mercy of a few foreign buyers.With Sékou Touré’s death in 1984 the repres-sive control his party had exercised ended. Therewas to be no opening to civilian party rule,however. The armed forces seized power in a
bloodless coup led by a new strongman, Colonel
Lansana Conté, who denounced Sékou Touré’s
bloody and ruthless dictatorship. The economywas in a terrible state after twenty years ofMarxism, and the new leader turned to the West.
With nowhere else to go for economic aid, he
ended the policy of isolation. France, the WorldBank and the International Monetary Fundoffered assistance with aid and in liberalising theeconomy. Opposition to military rule mounted
and the military procured a ﬁve-year programme
in 1988 for a transition to civilian rule, with elec-
tions for a parliament in 1992 and a presidentialelection in 1993.One-party states and authoritarian leadershipbecame the norm for the newly independent
French African territories in Benin, Niger,
Cameroon, Togo, Burkina Faso and Mauritania.
The same was essentially true of Senegal, althoughits leader, Leopold Senghor, was an impressivelyeducated man in the Christian humanist tradition,
a Catholic and a professor at the Sorbonne who
expounded ‘negritude’, the identification with
African culture; Senghor’s very French educationled him to seek the value of black culture and toset limits to assimilation, yet he also adopted the
socialist Western model of a dominant one-party
state.With the collapse of the people’s republics ofEastern Europe in 1989 and the economic fail-ures of communist economic state management,
which became so evident as the 1980s drew to a
close, the authoritarian rulers sought to change
their image. A further cause of change was the
perilous economic condition of developing Africa.African states overspent lavishly in the 1970s, onlyto suffer economically from the upheavals of the
mid-1970s and from falling commodity prices in
the 1980s. Most African states became saddled
with heavy foreign debts. To gain access to essen-tial new funds from the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund, their leaders had to
accept a painful restructuring of their economies
and their politics. But the impoverished masses
ceased to be docile; workers, teachers and civil
servants went on strike to halt the steep falls intheir standards of living. Corruption became themost obvious target for their anger. As a result,
the style of African government began to change:
African leaders at least had to appear accountable
to the people. The president of Benin in 1990renounced failed Marxism and introduced amulti-party system. The presidential election in
1991 marked a ﬁrst in continental Africa. It was
free and an incumbent president lost it, accepting728AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
defeat and bowing to the democratic process. Themilitary gave way to civilian rule. In Gabon,where President Omar Bongo ruled uninterrupt-
edly for more than twenty years, the one-party
system ended in 1990. Bongo survived the tran-
sition and retained power. But the old problemsof underdevelopment, lack of mass education(though there were remarkable improvements),
ethnic conﬂicts and past political traditions did
not augur well for the establishment of deeply
rooted, democratically based representative gov-
ernments in the 1990s.The British colonies followed another path toindependence, which differed from the French;
retention of imperial control, or – in the case of
the white settlers – of the settlers’ control, wasafter all the common objective in both Frenchand British African territories until the 1950s.
British governments allowed more initiative to the
men on the spot, allowing a colonial administra-
tion that was less rigidly centralised than theFrench. British territories were ruled by a mixtureof direct and indirect control. There were so few
Europeans that what became known as ‘indirect
rule’ was almost inevitable; agreements were made
with indigenous African chiefs and potentates,who accepted British suzerainty but were left torule their ﬁefs under ultimate British supervision.Administration by indirect rule is particularly asso-
ciated with Frederick Lugard, who conquered
northern Nigeria (1900–6) and then combined it
with southern Nigeria into one large colony. Butnorthern Nigeria, with 10 million inhabitants,could not be directly governed by a handful of
Europeans, so Muslim Fulani emirs were left with
a semblance of their old authority to maintain
order and undertake the administration.The signiﬁcant point about British rule overtropical Africa is that what began as expediencybecame a general doctrine of ‘indirect rule’, a
means of British–African cooperation in the
development of colonies. Thus, so it was believed,
African society – shorn of its worst features, suchas slavery – would be preserved for an eventualAfrican future. But indirect rule generally func-
tioned only in the least developed regions of
Africa; on the West African coast direct rule had
long replaced the older African society. Wheresigniﬁcant numbers of white settlers were claim-ing the territories as their African birthright, as
they were in southern Rhodesia, Kenya or South
Africa, or where large-scale mining of copper had
given rise to important industrial enterprises, as in1THE END OF WHITE RULE IN WEST AFRICA729

All gained independence in 1960,except Guinea (1958).northern Rhodesia or South Africa, traditionalAfrican structures were subservient to white needsand exploitation.In West African colonies, educated Africanswere emerging as an elite group, participating in
the administration. The great majority of suchAfricans hoped to play a role in the colonial hier-
archy and to profit from the status thereby
achieved; European control was far too tight to
give Africans any realistic hopes of African ‘inde-
pendence’ before the Second World War. Africans
collaborating with the colonial government couldthereby exercise some influence in defence ofAfrican rights but could not challenge overall
colonial dependency. But it was possible for
Africans to combine together to protect their
interests, a move which at the same time servedto identify and strengthen an African identity andsolidarity. Examples ranged from the association
of prosperous African cocoa farmers on the Gold
Coast to organised strikes in Sierra Leone, Nigeria
and Senegal in the 1920s. African political stir-rings in the 1920s and 1930s are signiﬁcant onlyinsofar as they represent the roots of African
politics after the Second World War, when move-
ments at last began to achieve a mass following.
But the depression of the 1930s and the Second
World War itself were fundamentally to changethe face of Africa and undermine the pillars ofEuropean colonial control.The British bestowed on Africa all the trap-pings of parliamentary democracy – the speaker’s
mace, the judges’ wigs and legislative institutions.The French superimposed the accoutrements oftheir democratic civilisation. But this panoply 
of democracy did not correspond to the reali-
ties of colonial rule. Judged positively, Britain and
France had begun to guide Africa along the road
to democracy, but that road was intended to bea long one indeed. Governments in London andParis after the end of the Second World War
believed that Africans would only be capable of
complete self-rule after one or even two genera-
tions. In the event, independence was concededmuch sooner, little more than a decade later.Representative constitutions were conferred on
peoples who lacked technological skills, who were
poorer than most of the other peoples of theThird World and of whom the great majoritywere illiterate. The strongest groups and individ-uals gained power and held on to it as long as
they could, repressing any opposition, which was
treated as sedition. Thus black Africa was ruled
for decades by strong leaders or, if the politicalleadership did not prove powerful enough, thesoldiers would rebel and clear out the corrupt
politicians until government corrupted them too.
Post-independence, many African countries have
a bad record. Some, such as Uganda, have suf-
fered more through internal conﬂict and tyranni-cal rule since colonial rule was ended than theyever did before independence. But this too is one
of the legacies of the era of colonialism and
underdevelopment.The Gold Coast was the most developed andprosperous of Britain’s African colonies. TheWestern-educated elite of teachers, administra-

tors, lawyers and businessmen became increas-

ingly frustrated by the continuing dominance of
British interests in the management of the colonyafter the Second World War. But though Britainnow had a Labour government, which felt greater
sympathy for the African people, its own interests,
especially given the parlous state of sterling, 
ruled out independence: the Gold Coast’s cocoa
was too valuable an earner of dollars. India wasgranted independence speedily for fear of seriouspolitical unrest, but none was expected in the
African colonies, which would be permitted to
govern themselves step by step through a long
period of partnership, with Britain controlling thepace. That pace was too slow for the Gold CoastAfrican elite, and Dr Danquah, a prominent
lawyer, in 1947 formed a moderate political party,
the United Gold Coast Convention, to hasten
constitutional reform. The ﬁery young Kwame
Nkrumah was appointed its secretary. In February1948 there were riots in protest against economicrestrictions and European businesses, which led
to widespread destruction after a British police
ofﬁcer had ﬁred on demonstrating ex-servicemen
and killed two; twenty-nine more died in the violence. The Labour government in Londonreacted positively, hoping to win over the mod-
erate nationalist leaders. Danquah was invited,
together with other moderates, to advise on a730AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
new constitution that would allow more Africanrepresentation. It was established in 1951.Nkrumah, who was far more radical than theAfrican establishment, opposed this development,
which he regarded as a sell-out to the British. He
passionately believed in African power, in pan-Africanism. Although inspired by Lenin’s writingson anti-imperialism, he was to be no tool of
Moscow or slavish follower of communism. His
prime objective was Africa for the Africans. In the
Gold Coast he discovered his talent for oratory
and organisation. Objecting to the elitism of theUnited Gold Coast Convention, he resigned assecretary – the Convention leaders were probably
ready to remove him anyway – and organised his
own mass base in June 1949, the Convention
People’s Party, adroitly choosing the platform‘self-government now’ – not total independence.He challenged the 1951 constitution, and govern-
ment efforts to suppress his movement prompted
him to respond with ‘positive action’ and a general
strike. The British governor arrested and impris-oned him and other leaders of his party, but – notfor the ﬁrst time in colonial history – this coercion
simply rebounded to create a national hero.
Nkrumah’s party won nearly all the seats in the
Legislative Assembly when elections were held 
in 1951.Britain now showed a characteristic sense ofrealism, without the least regard for saving face.
Nkrumah was released from prison and, almost 
at once, he was invited with his colleagues to
assume ministerial ofﬁce. From 1951 to 1957, the
Gold Coast administration was Africanised, withNkrumah as prime minister, and yet another elec-

tion and constitution in 1954 became the penulti-

mate step to complete independence. If the British
hoped that a strong rival would emerge with the
help of an alliance of parties led by Dr KoﬁBusia,
whose strongest backing came from the Asanteregion, they were disappointed. Nkrumah’s party
once more enjoyed a clear majority in the 1956
election, and on 5 March 1957 the peaceful trans-

fer of power was ceremonially enacted; the GoldCoast became Ghana and its red, green and goldﬂag replaced the Union Jack.As an African leader taking his country to inde-pendence, Nkrumah has a well-deserved place inhistory. But, as the ﬁrst political leader of Ghana,he exhibited some of the worst features of post-independence rulers. Political freedoms were
speedily curtailed and abolished. Danquah and
other political opponents were imprisoned with-
out trial. Nkrumah went on to destroy the parliamentary and independent legal institutionsthe British had left behind. Power corrupted 
him. His megalomania found outlets in wasteful
public buildings and a personality cult, and –
made redundant by his dictatorial presidency – his
party withered away. His grandeur impressed themasses, but his inconsistent economic policies,which passed from capitalist enterprise to state
socialism and massive public spending, speeded
the economy on a downward path. There was
hardship and Nkrumah was deservedly blamed,but a root cause was the decline in the world priceof cocoa; between 1954 and independence in
1957 it had almost halved, and then between
1957 and 1965 it nearly halved again. A military
coup in 1966, while Nkrumah was abroad, endedhis rule and he died in African exile.The subsequent political history of Ghana isone of military coups interspersed by periods of
civilian rule. The military, whose ofﬁcers were fre-
quently trained by the West, proved more pow-
erful in many independent African states than thepoliticians, who also derived their training andmodels from Western or Eastern Europe. With-
out secure party bases and electoral legitimacy,
power has been too often concentrated in the
hands of one leader. When the leader is removedin a coup it becomes relatively easy to change thepower elite and its beneficiaries. The masses
accept the change because they have to, or they
may welcome it optimistically, hoping for better
times. Reliance on one or two commodities has
resulted in violent swings in the fortunes ofAfrican countries. The people suffer when pricesare low and blame the rulers then in power,
whose corruption becomes even more provoking.General Ankrah led the ﬁrst Ghanaian military
coup in 1966, but he had little success in solvingthe complex economic problems, and his policiestended to beneﬁt the military. Ankrah did, how-

ever, intend to return Ghana to civilian govern-

ment, and Nkrumah’s political opponents were1THE END OF WHITE RULE IN WEST AFRICA731
released. The fourth coup in May 1979 broughtinto the limelight a charismatic leader whopromised to rid Ghana of corruption and to return
the government to civilians. Flight-Lieutenant
Jerry Rawlings was of mixed Ghanaian and
Scottish parentage and enjoyed widespread popu-
larity. After a grisly period of punishment and abloodbath of executions of prominent Ghanaians,
including three former heads of state, Rawlings did
hand over to civilian government in September
1979, but this lasted only until December 1981,
when Rawlings once more seized power.Rawlings ruled Ghana throughout the 1980s, adecade of great economic difﬁculty for the people.
In 1984 he declared his intention of working
towards a representative system of government,
but he insisted that in the meantime the failures ofeconomic development would have to be reme-died. The economy improved slowly, but hardly
any progress towards representative government
was made in the 1980s at all. The reality was a
country ruled by a military regime, whose politicalopponents were arrested and detained. Rawlingsincreasingly associated civilians with the gov-
ernment, while making sure that he retained 
control, but the lack of accountability inevitably
bred corruption. By the close of the decade the
demands for democracy were growing louder,even though opposition leaders had been detain-ed. Internationally, there was more conﬁdence 

in the economic policies of the regime than there
was in its claim to be leading the country back 
to representative democratic government. But in1991 there was at last some progress. Opposi-tion groups combined and Rawlings called on a
constituent assembly to draft a new constitution.
He promised to lift the bans on political parties
and to hold national and presidential elections 
in 1992. But a new constitution was approved bya referendum in April 1992 with a multi-party legislature and a president directly elected. The
president’s and legislature’s terms are for four
years and the president may only serve two terms,
thus breaking the common post-colonial era oflong lasting authoritarian leaders relying on thesupport of the army. Jerry Rawlings was elected
president again in 1992 and 1996. The real test
was whether or not he would quietly go in 2000or organise another coup. After the elections ofDecember 2000 the first peaceful democraticchange of power took place when John Kufuor, 
an educated lawyer and Christian was elected 
president and his New Patriotic Party narrowly
beat Rawlings’ National Democratic Congress.Rawlings has since respected the constitution.Ghaniaians now enjoy civic freedoms, there is a
free press and media. Rawlings’ biggest contribu-
tion to Ghana was the manner of his going. The
history of his eighteen-year rule is chequered.
Corruption here too became widespread, therewas human-rights abuse and, despite its resources,Ghana has remained trapped in poverty. On the
positive side though, apart from the ethnic vio-
lence in the north in 1994 and 1995, there has
been relatively little ethnic conﬂict compared toother African countries. In the new millenniumthe 21 million Ghaniaians have a happier future to
look forward to.The same unstable military–political rivalry forpower is evident in the history of Nigeria, by farthe most populous of African nations. It reached
independence in 1960, soon after Ghana. In 
addition to the problems of underdevelopment
common to the rest of British West Africa, Nigeria
presented a post-colonial dilemma rooted in itsterritorial conquest and administration under theBritish. In the Muslim north, the ethnic Hausa-
Fulani ruled indirectly through their own emirs,
while the Yoruba inhabited the Western region
and the Ibo the eastern. Each region overwhelm-
ingly supported its own political leader and party.In the 1950s and 1960s Nigeria produced some
outstanding political leaders, who transcended
tribal and regional outlooks even though their
electoral bases were largely regional and ethnic.Among the earliest Nigerians to ﬁght colonialstatus was the American-educated Dr NnamdiAzikiwe, who started a chain of newspapers, 
the ﬁrst in 1937, to spread his ideas about racial
injustice, opposition to British rule and the 
need for positive action. His papers clashed withthe British authorities when in 1945 they back-ed strikes by workers in government service.
Azikiwe’s electoral power base was in the eastern,
Ibo-dominated region, which supported the party732AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
he had founded in 1944, the National Council ofNigeria and Cameroons (NCNC). The Yoruba, inthe western region, supported the party led by
Chief Obafemi Awolowo. But together the
peoples of the western and eastern regions con-
stituted no more than half of Nigeria’s total pop-ulation. The Muslim-dominated north of theHausa-Fulani created its own party, the Northern
People’s Congress, whose most impressive politi-
cian was the deputy leader Abubakar Tafawa
Balewa. The early misfortunes of Nigerian inde-
pendence stemmed from the fact that the culturaland regional clashes and the militancy of regionalgroups proved more powerful than the urge to
create a united Nigerian nation that would allow
each region some measure of autonomy. The par-
liamentary system that Britain had created beforeindependence gave no regional party the major-ity, though the north was allowed a representa-
tion larger than the west and east combined.Immediately after independence in 1960,power was exercised by a coalition of the northand east, Ibo and Hausa, who had nothing incommon except the desire to gain patronage.
Azikiwe became head of state and Tafawa Balewa
federal prime minister, and Awolowo headed the
opposition until imprisoned in 1962. Electoral
rigging and corruption created intense bitterness,and there were serious disturbances. In January1966 Ibo ofﬁcers of the federal army led a mutiny
and assassinated prominent politicians, including
the federal prime minister Abubakar Balewa. The
ofﬁcers all came from the south; their objectivewas to overthrow the north’s political domination.Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi re-establishedcontrol and assumed power, the military taking
over from the failed politicians. Ironsi, adopting
a policy of unifying Nigeria and abolishing the
federation, favoured Ibo advisers and so arousedthe apprehensions of the conservative north. TheIbos who had migrated to the north to take up
posts in the railways and banks and who had
established themselves as enterprising traders
formed a better-off elite deeply resented by theHausa. Ironsi’s military coup was soon inter-
preted in the north as an Ibo plot to dominate
the country. When the false rumour was spread
that the many Ibo ofﬁcers in the north plannedto kill their fellow ofﬁcers, the northern juniorofficers and NCOs in July 1966 organised asecond coup which began by mass killings of Ibo
ofﬁcers. Among the victims was Major-General
Ironsi. His chief of staff, Colonel Yakubu Gowon,
a Christian from a Muslim region without ethnicprejudice, was chosen by the coup leaders as thenew military ruler.Gowon, who had so accidentally come topower, was to play a major role in Nigeria’s
history. But during the following months, despite
conciliatory efforts, he was unable to master thegrowing fanaticism in the north and east. In thenorth, the unrest culminated in the massacre of
thousands of Ibos. Hausas who lived in the east
were driven out and retaliatory killings took place.
Two million panic-stricken refugees, mainly Ibofrom the north, tried to get back to their ownpeople. Nigeria was threatened with anarchy, each
region going its own way.The biggest tragedy was yet to come – civilwar. The military commander of the eastern Iboregion, Odumegwu Ojukwu, on 30 May 1967declared the region’s independence as the new
state of Biafra. Fighting on the ground began in
July as Gowon, despairing of a peaceful resolu-
tion, was determined to maintain Nigerian unity.
The civil war lasted nearly three years, untilJanuary 1970. The Biafrans, with the main oilreserves and the reﬁnery at Port Harcourt in their
region, had for a time the resources to secure
weapons and help from abroad, especially from
France, Portugal and South Africa. Their seces-sion was soon recognised by a number of Africanstates. Although the Ibos fought ﬁercely, they
faced an overwhelmingly larger federal army, and
when a blockade was imposed, food supplies to
the civilian population dwindled. Famine killed
hundreds of thousands, many more than died inthe ﬁghting. Pitiful television pictures and news-paper reports reached the West and aroused wide-
spread sympathy for the cause of Biafra, but
Britain refused to intervene. Gowon made it clear
that the federal government and army were notengaged in genocide.Gowon’s statesmanship was proven whenBiafra surrendered. There was no revenge such as
the Ibos had feared, for Gowon wanted to heal1THE END OF WHITE RULE IN WEST AFRICA733
the wounds. Ojukwu ﬂed into exile. A few Biafranofﬁcers were imprisoned for a short time, but
many Ibos were reinstated in federal jobs.
Unfortunately, Gowon proved to be indecisive
and incompetent as a peacetime leader. Despitethe oil boom which followed the price rise of1973–4 and huge increases in export earnings,
the development plans of the 1970s and 1980s
did not bring greater prosperity to the majority
of the people. Money was made by a businesselite; industry, transport and social servicesexpanded; but agricultural growth could not keep
pace with a rapidly increasing population.In 1975 General Gowon was overthrown byanother military coup, and the anti-corruption
drive that followed led to the dismissal of some10,000 bureaucrats. During an army mutiny in1976 the head of state was murdered and another
general succeeded. By then the oil boom was over
and the Nigerian economy fell into deficit.
Economic development was hindered by politicalinstability. In 1979 the military handed the gov-ernment back to the civilians, but this Second
Republic lasted only until 1983, when another
coup restored the military to power with promises
to hand the country back to civilian rule, whenthe corrupt politicians of the First and SecondRepublic would be barred from ofﬁce. Although
Nigeria’s oil earnings reached a peak in 1982 fol-
lowing the 1979–80 price rise, a ﬂood of imports
created a huge foreign debt in less than a decade.Nigeria, once a country of promise, at inde-
pendence has suffered sixteen years of military mis-

rule. The eighth-largest oil producers in the world,
the inﬂux of petrodollars into the state coffers have
utterly corrupted the country and brought it to the
brink of ruin. The lowest point was reached whena general, Sani Abacha, manoeuvred himself intopower in 1993. The Yoruba chief Moshood Abida
who had won the elections was thrown into prison,
his wife was mysteriously shot in 1996 and he died
in prison. Abacha and his family looted the coun-
734AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE

tracts, accepting bribes that made generals, state
governors, civil servants and Abachas’ cronies rich
beyond their dreams. The money was sent abroad,deposited in currencies which, unlike the Nigerian,retain value. But Nigerian corruption had to be
matched by the readiness of ﬁrms doing business

with Nigeria to comply with the condition set, and
by banks in London, New York and Switzerland
who until recently accepted huge cash deposits ofdubious provenance. In November 1995 theworld’s attention was drawn to the brutality of 
the regime when the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight activists were hanged for campaigning for 
the autonomy of the Ogoni people. Nigeria wassuspended from the Commonwealth; sanctions didnot bother Abacha. Elections were drawing near in
1998 with Abacha as only candidate when fortu-

nately for Nigeria he had a heart attack apparently
during the course of a Viagra-assisted sex orgy.After a brief period of military rule underGeneral Abdulsalam Abukabar with the promise
kept to hand over to civilian rule, the elections in
February 1999 brought another ex-general to the
presidency, Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo’s cre-
dentials were better than that of previous gener-als. When previously in power (1976–9) he hadvoluntarily handed it over to a civilian govern-
ment. In April 2003, Obasanjo won the elections
for a second term in ofﬁce. Although the elec-
tions were far from free of local manipulation andcorruption – state ofﬁces, and so the ability toacquire money, being dependent on party and
personalities in power – Obasanjo would have
won anyway though by a smaller majority in the
multi-party contest.Nigeria is the largest and most powerful coun-
try in the continent with a population almost three times as large as South Africa’s but a Gross
Domestic Product of only a third, its export trade
consisting of practically nothing other than oil sent
mainly to the US. Yet, too little of what Nigeriaearns from oil beneﬁts the people, whose standard
of living has not improved, indeed, has declined.
Hospitals, schools and public services have deteri-

orated. Obasanjo has promised to root out corrup-
tion, but it is so embedded and endemic that it willrequire a wholly transformed civil service as busi-
ness and contracts remain predominantly con-

trolled by the state. The religious and tribal fault
lines added to the country’s problems when the
Muslim renaissance in the north and the attemptsto introduce sharia law were met by the resistanceof the Christian minority; in the Nigeria delta, the
people see the oil wealth taken from them. After
Abacha, Obasanjo could not fail to be an improve-

ment. Economically progress has been slow, cor-

ruption persists, but for the ﬁrst time civilian rule
has been established, the military curbed, humanrights respected during Obasanjo’s presidency. A
devout Christian, he has tried to steer a middle
course between religious tolerance and checking
excesses. The future is a little brighter.Conﬂict and turbulence since independence arenot just consequences of European colonial rule
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This is
shown by the history of Liberia and its war-torncondition in the early 1990s. Liberia was the onlypart of West Africa to avoid outright European
colonisation. It is unique in Africa in another way:
the overseas settlers who imposed their rule on
the indigenous African peoples were not white
but black. Early in the nineteenth century thephilanthropic American Colonisation Society hadthe romantic notion of undoing some of the harm
done by the slave trade by resettling freed slaves
in Africa and so returning them to an African way
of life. The Society induced indigenous Africanchieftains to allow a settlement on the coast ofwhat became Liberia. The ﬁrst freed slaves landed
in 1822. But it was a white American, Jehudi
Ashmun, who during his stay in the territory
(1822–8) organised the government of the black
settlers and so became the real founder of Liberia.The dependence on Anglo-Saxon Americans wasto be characteristic of the next 150 years of
Liberia’s history. Its independence was recognised
by the European nations in the mid-nineteenth
century, but it remained under American protec-tion, though the US was actually the last majornation to recognise its independence, in 1862.A constitution modelled on that of the US wasadopted and the capital was named Monrovia in1THE END OF WHITE RULE IN WEST AFRICA735
honour of the American President. But only the‘civilised’ had the vote, and that meant thedescendants of the American freed slaves known
as Americo-Liberians. The hinterland, where the
great majority of the population lived, was admin-
istered by indirect rule through chieftains. Themajority of the population was thus colonised asin white settler colonies. In 1919 part of this hin-
terland, which the Americo-Liberians could not
control, was simply ceded to France. A worse
scandal came to light in the 1920s when a League
of Nations investigation uncovered forced labourand the shipment of virtual slaves to the Spanishplantations in Fernando Po. Greed for profit
knows no colour bars.Liberia was ruled by one party, the True WhigParty, which monopolised power and patronagefor more than 100 years. The majority living inthe hinterland only gradually became associated
as citizens of Liberia after the Second World 
War. During the era when William Tubman was
president from 1944 to 1971 (he was always re-elected!), a minority representation was achiev-ed by the majority of the people. Tubman, con-
servative and always ready to welcome Western
economic penetration, died in ofﬁce. His succes-
sor, Vice-President Tolbert, inaugurated a more
liberal regime and was sworn in wearing an open-necked shirt. He followed a policy of moderatereforms and closer integration with the peoples 
of the hinterland.The world economic problems of the mid-1970s and the growth of opposition groupsundermined Tolbert. Corruption remained en-demic. In 1980 Master-Sergeant Samuel Doe
organised a military revolt, and a new generation
of soldiers seized control from the political elite.
Former ministers were publicly executed by ﬁring
squad, Doe ordering the executions to be ﬁlmed.His bloody coup ended the reign of the TrueWhig Party and the Americo-Liberians. The new
military People’s Reception Council conﬁscated
the assets of the former political leaders and raised
wages. But Liberia remained poor and under-developed, and government deteriorated oncemore into corruption.Liberia’s ties with the US, and Western loansand aid, failed to lift the population out ofpoverty. To the outside world the Liberianeconomy became synonymous with the FirestoneRubber Company, which introduced rubber plan-
tations in the 1870s. Rubber became Liberia’s
most important export and was invaluable after
the fall of Malaya during the Second World War.After the 1950s the mining of iron ore replacedit as the principal export, and together iron and
rubber contributed 90 per cent in value to
Liberia’s export trade. Industry remained very
small, so that Liberia’s economy is typical of
Third World countries in depending on worldtrade conditions and the prices of a few basiccommodities. But a description of Liberia would
not be complete without noting one more pecu-
liarity. It possesses, nominally, the largest mer-
chant ﬂeet in the world. These are, of course, notLiberian but foreign ships registered under theLiberian ﬂag, notorious for lax regulations and
low registration fees, and so widely favoured by
shipowners.President Doe ruled the country tyrannicallyfor ten years. In 1989 Liberia erupted in civil warbetween rival ethnic groups. The savagery of that
conﬂict, with ill-disciplined rebel forces shooting
and pillaging, has wrecked the country. Doe
grimly held on to dwindling power in his palace
in Monrovia, refusing American offers to escorthim to safety. In the summer of 1990 an Africanpeacekeeping force entered Liberia and in
September one of the rival forces captured Doe
and killed him. The state was bankrupt, and
administration collapsed as rival factions spreadterror throughout the country. Black Africanintervention with troops and through mediation
succeeded in establishing a ceaseﬁre and an agree-
ment on an interim president, but Liberia’s
uneasy settlement proved fragile. Civil war and
political chaos continued, despite the presence ofa peacekeeping force from neighbouring WestAfrican states.Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thewestern region of the Côte D’Ivoire were all
enmeshed in internal civil wars supported bymarauding groups from across their frontiers instruggles for power. Even by the lowest standards
of warfare, the savagery of the ill-disciplined mil-
itaries has shocked the world, child soldiers are736AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
brutalised and join in an orgy of mutilation,hacking off limbs of men, women and even chil-
dren. There is nowhere to ﬂee to safety.In Liberia, Charles Taylor who led the rebelmovement won an ‘election’ organised in a peace
deal in 1997. The ruthless rebel leader was meta-
morphosed overnight into a president and head
of state with all the trappings of legitimacy, a gov-ernment, ambassadors and a representative at theUN. But the man had not changed. His power
was not undisputed when another rebel group
attacked to seize the fruits of power. They fought
to oust Taylor and committed atrocities on thehelpless villagers in their path. To gain control ofdiamonds Taylor armed another set of murder-
ous rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone. Belatedly
an international mediating group of Britain,
France and a number of African countries have
tried to broker peace between Taylor and therebels in Liberia who hold large parts of thecountry in their grip. The struggle for diamonds
continues to blight the whole region. One in ten
of Liberia’s population have fled from their
homes. The capital Monrovia is a city in ruins.In August 2003 the Nigerian-led West Africanpeace force returned with US support under UN
auspices and Taylor, facing a war crime trial,departed for a comfortable exile in Nigeria. Theroad to peace is hazardous but conditions could
not get worse.The 1990s were also disastrous for Sierra Leone,rent by civil war. The Nigerians were the largest
component of West African peacekeeping forces
which kept fighting in check for most of thedecade. When they left United Nations peace-keepers from thirty-one countries were unable to
stop renewed carnage and soon UN soldiers were
trapped by rebel militia which approached the
outskirts of Freetown. The ill-organised SierraLeone army was close to collapse. In May 2000Britain sent paratroops and marines to stop and
turn back the rebel advance. Washington in a deal
with Taylor secured the release of the detach-
ment. The rebels in Sierra Leone controlled the
diamond mines, and were supported by Taylorwho provided an outlet for illicit diamond sales,proﬁting in the process. The diamond earnings
provided the rebels with arms. The rebels control
large areas of the country by committing atroci-
ties and a reign of terror whose most visible evi-dence are the stumps of amputated legs and handsof the people considered, at a whim, to be
enemies.1THE END OF WHITE RULE IN WEST AFRICA737

European colonial rule, based on overwhelmingmilitary power, established common patterns of
control. Resistance to authority was harshly sup-
pressed, and equal rights and opportunities werewithheld from the African majority. British,Belgian, French and Portuguese colonial govern-
ment each had its distinctive features and the
European nations hoped that these would form
the basis of government in independent Africa.
The inﬂuence of the colonial period was neverobliterated, but each newly independent Africannation developed along its own path. Much
depended on the dominant African leadership, on
the accident of the personality and outlook of the
most powerful man or group, on whether his ortheir prestige survived the struggle for independ-ence or whether new groups and leaders seized
control in a separate struggle for power. Africa
abounds with examples of the inﬂuence of the
individual on history. This at least in part accounts
for the very different evolution of Tanzania, Kenyaand Uganda after Britain relinquished colonialpower.The Belgian Congo in Central Africa couldnot remain isolated from the new nationalism
sweeping through British and French West Africa.But it was a latecomer as far as black nationalismwas concerned. When it came to 1960 the trans-
fer of power was sudden, and the least successful.
For years afterwards this huge country was rent
by internal conflict; to make matters worse itbecame the focus of international Cold Warrivalry. Yet in one sense the Belgians had beenamong the more enlightened colonial administra-
tors in Africa, once the Belgian Parliament had
taken responsibility for the country in 1908. Thisparadox requires some explanation.The Congo’s real capital was Brussels. Thecolony was governed from Europe in a highly cen-
tralised way by Belgian administrators, with no
African participation. The 100,000 or more
Belgians in the Congo, unlike the whites in theBritish settler colonies, had no local politicalrights. For this there was no one simple reason;
before 1957 there was no elective body or legisla-
ture in existence in the Congo. The idea was that,
until the Africans were judged capable of exercis-ing the vote, no one should have it, thus hopefullyavoiding white-settler domination. In 1949 the
Belgian Parliament approved a ten-year plan for
the economic and social development of the
Congo and for raising African living standards.
Primary education was the best in Africa and liter-acy the highest. This was largely due to the mis-sionaries and to Belgian ofﬁcial encouragement.
But there was practically no advanced schooling.
The very ﬁrst African graduated at a Belgian uni-
versity only in 1956, nor was there a single blackofﬁcer in the Congolese police or in the military orin the Force Publique, responsible for public
order. Independence was a distant prospect.The most important economic developments in the Congo were concentrated in the province of Katanga on the borders of Rhodesia andChapter 64FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN CENTRALAND EAST AFRICATanganyika. From there rich deposits of copper,cobalt and other valuable minerals were exported.To the north-west, the province of Kasai provided
in 1959 most of the world’s industrial diamonds.
This mineral wealth was in the hands of Belgian
trusts, the most important being the SociétéGénérale and the Union Minière. Although mostof the proﬁt ﬂowed out of the country, as in other
colonies, the Belgians were at least more enlight-

ened than the South African mineowners in
encouraging Africans to acquire technical expertise
in their mines. The other regions of the Congowere very poor, and here agriculture provided themeans of livelihood and the source of exports.When nationalism developed late in the mid-1950s it was strongly ethnic, regional and divisive.
There were four main parties: the Abako, led byJoseph Kasavubu; the Parti Solidaire Africaine, ledby Antoine Gizenga; the Katangan association,
Conakat for short, led by Moise Tschombe; and
the Mouvement National Congolais, whose ﬁery
and controversial leader was Patrice Lumumba.In the 1950s the Belgians belatedly decidedthat some African representation in the adminis-
tration of the Congo had become necessary. They
accordingly organised municipal elections in 1959
by manhood suffrage, one man one vote. This, in
turn, stimulated agitation: in 1959 there wasrioting and looting in Léopoldville. The pace nowquickened. The Belgians, at ﬁrst so slow to accept
Africanisation, now seemingly could not get out
fast enough. They wanted to abandon the increas-
ingly burdensome task of keeping order in thecountry but to retain their industrial interests.After all, the Congolese would not be able to run
the mines and market the metals without them.
The fact that the Congolese were not adequately
prepared to run their government administration
nor their army and police did not deter theBelgians. The Congolese, they reasoned, couldalways ask for their assistance. So elections were
arranged in May 1960 and the independent
Congo handed over to a cobbled-together coali-
tion of political rivals, with Kasavubu as presidentand Lumumba as prime minister.Independence day was 30 June 1960. Lessthan a week later violence erupted. The frustra-
tion of the Congolese NCOs and soldiers in theForce Publique boiled over; they were angered bythe fact that only Belgian ofﬁcers gave commands.Mutinying soldiers murdered their ofﬁcers and
went on the rampage, killing and raping whites
and looting. The Belgian troops still in the Congo
left their bases to protect and evacuate theirnationals. But Kasavubu and Lumumba suspectedthe Belgians of harbouring sinister designs, espe-
cially when Tschombe declared the richest mining
province of Katanga independent. The world 
was horriﬁed by the anarchy and the televised pic-
tures of bloated corpses ﬂoating downriver. Tocheck the atrocities and safeguard the Europeans,Lumumba had no reliable force apart from the
Belgian troops, but he wanted the Belgians out.
Wishing also to recover control of Katanga, 
he appealed to the United Nations. The UN re-sponded with promises to help restore law andorder; but it declared that the secession of
Katanga was not its concern.During July, the UN peacekeeping force beganto arrive and the Belgian soldiers left. But para-military troops and mercenaries from Europe,Rhodesia and South Africa were ready to defend
Katanga and the European mining interests.
Lumumba now made the error of turning for help
to the Soviet Union, asking the Russians to equip
a still largely unreliable Congolese army to occupyKatanga and crush the secession. Lumumba’srefusal to rely on UN forces and his determination
to maintain the ill-disciplined Congolese soldiers
under arms ensured that the disorders and the
attacks on white missionaries and Europeanswould continue. Then, in August, his troublesmultiplied when the province of Kasai also
seceded. Without the two mineral-rich provinces, a
Congo state would become one of the poorest in
Africa. In response to Lumumba’s appeal, Moscow
saw a chance to gain inﬂuence in the strategically
important country. Soviet aid arrived by air, andKasai was retaken for a time. But Kasavubu and the
African chief of staff Mobutu Sese Seko decided to
rid themselves of the radical Lumumba and to rely
instead on Western help. Lumumba was dismissed,and then arrested when Mobutu took power. In December 1960 the pro-Lumumba region
rebelled and set up a rival government. Mobutu
thereupon planned to silence Lumumba, who,1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN CENTRAL AND EAST AFRICA739
despite UN protection, was transported toKatanga by Mobutu’s soldiers. There, in January1961, he was killed ‘while trying to escape’.
Nothing can excuse what was in all probability a
murder; but a myth was in the making.The dead Patrice Lumumba was celebrated inMoscow as the anti-colonialist hero of Africanindependence, true patriot and Marxist. Had
Lumumba lived it is unlikely that he would have
acquired such an exalted reputation. As a politi-
cian he had lacked adroitness and good judge-
ment, and this had contributed to his fall frompower. He was indeed an African patriot, but anunrealistic one, and his brand of socialism,
common among Africans struggling against colo-
nialism, had little in common with Soviet com-
munism.The year 1961 saw no lessening of the chaos inthe Congo. Tschombe, installed in Katanga and
effectively separated from the rest of the Congo,
though supported by the Belgian mining interests,
talked and talked, claiming that he was ready to negotiate with the UN, but gave up nothing ofsubstance. In the Congo a new parliament assem-
bled under UN protection and a weak new civilian
regime was installed. Katanga meanwhile contin-
ued to maintain its independence, in practice
helped by the Belgians’ decision to pay the miningroyalties to Tschombe and not to the central gov-ernment. But Tschombe had not reckoned with a
determined and ambitious UN secretary-general.
Dag Hammarskjöld wanted to crown this ﬁrst
major UN peacekeeping effort with success. Itcost Hammarskjöld his life. In rather mysteriouscircumstances his plane crashed in September
1961, while he was engaged in negotiations 
with Tschombe. This hardened the attitude of 
the UN towards Katanga. Fighting had broken
out between UN troops and Tschombe’s forces in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga. With thecentral Congolese government now pro-Western
in orientation, the situation had changed. The
UN ordered the forcible occupation of Katanga,
and in January 1963 the province at last fell to aninternational force.Tschombe had left Katanga only to return inJuly 1964 as prime minister of a united Congo.
But he did not last long in ofﬁce. In October1965 Mobutu, exercising the real power in theCongo with his army command, organised a coupand once more took over the country. The
Belgian colonial pact was expunged. The major
towns were renamed, Léopoldville becoming
Kinshasa, and the Congo became Zaire.The immediate post-colonial turmoil in theCongo, the atrocities and the savagery and the
hiring of white mercenaries, all seemed to justify
the cynical view that black Africa was unﬁt to
govern itself. What was really shown in the Congo
and elsewhere in black Africa, however, was theweakness of democracy and elected national par-liaments; parliaments whose members were trib-
ally divided could not maintain unity in countries
as underdeveloped as Zaire, where in many rural
areas there was little education. Loyalties weretribal and ethnic in such conditions. Pent-upresentments against the better-off of other races,
whether European or Asian, could and did
explode into violence. If unity and order were to
be maintained, the country needed a strongmanwith an obedient party or a soldier who couldcount on an obedient army.For the ﬁrst thirteen years of his rule Mobutuwas occupied in putting down rebellions with
European aid. For the next twelve years he ruth-
lessly eliminated all political dissent. But the col-lapse of the communist regimes in EasternEurope and the Soviet Union seemed to convince
Mobutu that one-party authoritarian rule had
become even less acceptable to the outside world
on which Zaire relies for aid and trade. In 1990he promised to introduce multi-party govern-
ment. Mobutu explained that his version of a
multi-party state envisaged himself as above
politics, the ﬁnal arbiter and guarantor of national
unity. Unrest and dissenters were ruthlessly put
down, and at the university in Lubumbashi largenumbers of students were massacred on theircampus. In 1991, 130 political parties combined
for a time against the president. More seriously
the army rioted when it was not paid. In the fol-
lowing year more units of the army mutinied andthe Belgians evacuated thousands of their citizens.The country was economically in ruins, despite its
rich resources. The West cut off aid to register its
displeasure but was determined not to become740AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
involved in rescuing Zaire from misrule. In 1995the conﬂict entered a new, confusing phase in thisregion of the Congo. Previously settled by Tutsi
refugees from Rwanda, it was the centre of a
rebellion against Mobutu led by Laurent Kabila’s
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberationof the Congo. The Tutsis and Kabila joined forcesand attacked the refugee camps to drive the Hutu
militia and civilians out of the Congo and back
to Rwanda. Once again the UN, lacking Western
support, was unable to prevent thousands being
massacred as others ﬂed into the forests of theCongo. Kabila’s army then marched west, rein-forced by many deserters from Mobutu’s and 
in May 1997 he captured Kinshasa and drove
Mobutu into exile. He subsequently blocked all
attempts by the UN to investigate the killing ofthe Hutus. There was little regret following thefall of the corrupt Mobutu; he had been in power
for longer than any other African leader.The second half of the 1990s was even worsethan the ﬁrst. Laurent Kabila was unable to estab-lish the authority of the Kinshasa governmentover the whole country, half of it was in the
clutches of marauding rebel groups. The diamond
mines provided the means to secure weapons and
keep up the internal strife which spilled over into
Rwanda and Uganda. Control of the mines was apowerful incentive for Congo’s neighbours tointervene. A year after Kabila had been installed
with the help the rebels had secured from Uganda
and Rwanda, Uganda and Rwanda invaded again
to overthrow Kabila. Kabila called for foreign helpand Mugabe after securing diamond mine con-cessions sent troops from Zimbabwe, which were
joined by troops from Angola and Namibia. The
mines and natural resorces fuelled the conﬂicts.
Inside the Congo murderous militias fought each
other as well. In this bloody quagmire Rwandaand Uganda once allies, also began to ﬁght eachother. Then Laurent Kabila was assassinated and
his son Joseph succeeded. In the midst of all this
a small, wholly inadequate UN force is supposed
to help re-establish peace. Ceaseﬁres, troop with-drawals, treaties and mediation came and went.Understandably, the countries of the developed
world were reluctant to send soldiers to assist the
UN and risk death for a peace that no one on theground was prepared to keep. Meanwhile, armedHutu veterans who were responsible for theslaughter of the Tutsis in Rwanda camped in 
the eastern Congo along the shores of Lake
Tanganyka and Goma, destabilising the region.In the new millennium other murderous bandsalso terrorise, loot, kidnap the villagers on theborder and rape the women. International aid
workers sent to help dare not penetrate the most
dangerous areas. Since ﬁghting was renewed in
1998 more than three million people have been
killed or died from starvation, a drawn out geno-cide without an end in sight. The developedworld paid scant attention, their response in
sending some troops in 2003 and 2005 wholly
inadequate. Unless national interests are involved,
humanitarian needs are not enough to securetheir commitment.The early history of independent Uganda isscarcely happier than Zaire’s. This once fertile 
and rich country suffered decades of conﬂict and
destruction. The path to independence alsoinvolved overcoming difﬁculties special to Uganda.

It was not the white settlers who impeded the
granting of independence. There were less than
10,000 of them, and Asian settlers – although
70,000 lived in Uganda – were hardly considered.The path to independence was bedevilled by oldcolonial agreements, which had preserved tradi-

tional local monarchies; the most important was
that of Buganda, ruled by the kabaka. This
arrangement was a matter of colonial expediency, aform of indirect rule as was later developed innorthern Nigeria. The kabaka and the Bugandans
still wanted to preserve their autonomy and
customs, which by then were in conﬂict with the

rise of African nationalism in the rest of Uganda.
Even so, the usual process towards self-rule wasfollowed: first African representation on theLegislative Council was increased in the 1950s,
then in 1961 parliamentary elections were held.
Milton Obote, leader of the Uganda People’s
Congress, which sought early independence, fol-
lowed a tactic adopted by politicians in otherdivided African countries of forming temporary
political alliances in order to persuade the colon-
ial power to grant independence. Irreconcilable1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN CENTRAL AND EAST AFRICA741
conﬂicts were papered over. Britain was only tooanxious to accept at face value that the Africanpoliticians had indeed formed the consensus neces-

sary to make independence viable. And so in
October 1962 Uganda gained independence with
the kabaka as titular president; in 1963 Dr Obotebecame the chief minister. Obote attempted toovercome the internal conﬂict by authoritarian rule

and reliance on the army. In 1966 Obote set aside
the special rights enjoyed by the Buganda tribe in
the kingdom of Buganda and the kabaka was dri-

ven into exile. A short insurrection in May of thatyear by Bugandans was suppressed by force.The tragedy of Uganda was its so-called army,an undisciplined force which for years wreaked
destruction on the country. In 1971 it seized con-
trol of the government under its infamous chief ofstaff Idi Amin who, even before independence,had murders on his conscience. A soldier of great
physical strength, with minimal education but an
outwardly jovial presence, Amin was ostensibly a
Muslim, although in fact he was a barbarian. Hehad been one of the few black people promoted toofﬁcer rank in colonial times – the Ugandan army,
like the Congolese, had lacked black ofﬁcers – and
so he became a colonel almost immediately after
independence. Ugandans, who were at ﬁrst glad
to be rid of Obote, soon began to suffer evenmore under Amin, who as a Muslim had the sup-port of President Gaddaﬁof oil-rich Libya. Amin

gave the army free rein to massacre the inhabitants
of this small country of less than 10 million; pos-
sibly as many as 300,000 disappeared or weremurdered. The exact number of victims was neverestablished. Opponents ‘disappeared’ and met
violent deaths. Amin ruled by terror. Cabinet min-
isters, a courageous chief justice and the Anglican
archbishop were all killed. During Amin’s years of
misrule human rights were utterly disregarded.Yet the civilised world, including the UN, recog-nised him as president and received him with hon-
our. Most African states behaved no better. The
Organisation of African Unity paid him the com-
pliment of meeting in Kampala and elected himpresident. It was politic to ignore his part in themurder of hundreds of thousands of his own
people. This was the Realpolitikof the 1970s. Itwas Nyerere of Tanzania who ﬁnally toppled Aminfrom power in 1979 after the Ugandan leader hadinvaded Tanzania to settle by force the disputedfrontier between them.Amin was never brought to justice for his crimes;instead he was given shelter by Gaddaﬁin Libyan
exile and later Saudi Arabia where he died peace-fully. Obote thereupon sought a new mandate in
rigged elections and assumed the presidency. But
unhappy Uganda was rent by civil wars and tribal
conﬂicts, until in 1986 the National Resistance
Army led by Yoweri Museveni captured Kampala.Museveni put an end to Obote’s misrule. The taskthen was to rebuild Uganda. This would not be
easy after the policy of Africanisation which, on
Amin’s orders, had in the mid-1970s driven 
tens of thousands of industrious Asians out of the country. Their enterprise instead beneﬁtedBritain, despite the reluctance with which they
were allowed entry.President Yoweri Museveni and his ministersmade valiant efforts to bring about a reconciliationof warring factions, with some success. The econ-omy, dependent on coffee exports, was badly hit
when the world price of coffee fell again in 1992.
Foreign economic aid helped to support efforts to
reform the economy. In 1991 it became evident
that a new catastrophe threatened Uganda –AIDS. The Ugandan government was more openthan most in facing the scourge, which kills the
young and leaves behind the old and children. 
In 1991 1.2 million were estimated to be HIV-
infected and the numbers increased daily there-after. Yet, perversely, the Africa of the early 1990swas still threatened by overpopulation and famine.Yoweri Museveni is one of the few long-termAfrican leaders with much to his credit. Uganda
made a remarkable recovery from the depths of a
failing economy at the start of his presidency.There is more freedom than elsewhere and a par-liament that on occasion asserts itself. But this has
been a democracy for seventeen years without real
political parties, which Museveni feared would
split the country into rival tribalism, until in 2003Museveni announced the country might be readyfor multi-party politics. Re-elected in 2002 for a
ﬁnal four-year term he cannot stand again under
the present constitution. A new multi-party con-742AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
stitution, however, could remove the bar. In anycase a democratic constitution is more in tunewith the times and appeals to his Western donors.
Creditable too has been his early admission of the
disaster AIDS was creating in Uganda and the
efforts of education made by the administration tocurb its devastating spread. Uganda as a result is atthe lower end of sub-Saharan countries where the
young are infected with AIDS, far lower than
Zimbabwe and South Africa. Not everything,
however, has gone right. In Africa, decades of per-
sonal rule have led to widespread corruption andUganda is no exception. Museveni’s interventionin the conﬂicts of the Congo have been costly and
unpopular and ruinous for the people of the
Congo. Uganda in 2005 still had not overcome
the fanatical and brutal ‘Lord’s Resistance Army’of guerrillas, notorious for abducting children,which makes violent forays into Uganda. Uganda
borders the most lawless region of Africa where
death and violence are a daily occurrence. Is the
world getting better? Not for those who have tolive in the worst areas of Africa.Human-rights abuses were common in the one-party African states, and democracy was quickly
discarded as part of the colonial past. Some
African states were notorious for their leaders’savagery, not least Benin in the 1970s, whosepresident was executed for genocide after a coup
in 1979. The height of absurdity was reached in
one of Africa’s poorest countries, the Central
African Republic, where Colonel Jean-BedelBokassa seized power in December 1965 and, notsatisﬁed with becoming president, had himself
crowned emperor. He invited over 3,000 digni-
taries from all over the world to his ruinously
expensive coronation. He curried favour with
France, calling de Gaulle his ‘adoptive father’ andpresenting diamonds to those whose favours hewished to win. The murder of a group of children
in 1979 proved his undoing; he was beyond pro-
tection now and with the help of French troops
he was ousted later that year. Like Amin he wasnot brought to account for his crimes, but wasallowed a comfortable exile in the Ivory Coast.A horrifying example of the world’s selectiveconscience – no intervention as long as blackpeople are slaughtering black people (or Asians,Asians) – were the massacres that occurred in twosmall independent African countries, Rwanda and
Burundi. Here, the Tutsi minority ruled over the
majority Hutu. Tribal wars began in 1959 and
thousands of Tutsi ﬂed. In 1963, in fear of a Tutsiinvasion from neighbouring Burundi, the Hutumassacred thousands of Tutsi. In Burundi, after
an uprising of the Hutu in 1972, at least 100,000
of them were slaughtered. The tribal warfare did
not end there. The Burundi army next killed
thousands of Tutsi in 1988. The world conﬁneditself to relief work by the UN High Commissionfor Refugees. Rwanda and Burundi remain caul-
drons of tribal hatreds. Independence suited
Belgium, the former colonial power in the two
countries, which were not prepared for inde-
pendence nor given adequate assistance.In Rwanda and Burundi the conﬂict between
the Tutsis and Hutus goes back to colonial times.
The Tutsis adapted better to Western develop-

ments and formed an aristocracy of cattle-owners,while the majority Hutus largely belonged to thepoor peasantry. Both countries, once in German
colonial control, became Belgian League of
Nations mandates. The Belgians maintained the
feudal hierarchy in which the giant Tutsis domin-

ated the Hutus. In Burundi the Tutsis retainedpower for thirty-one years after independence in1962, bloodily suppressing any risings by the Hutu
majority; their rule came to an end only after elec-

tions in 1993. The new prime minister was then
assassinated and the Tutsi-dominated army massa-
cred thousands of Hutus. In Rwanda the Tutsislost power at the time of independence and many
ﬂed to Uganda, where they were not welcome. In
the early 1980s they joined Museveri’s National
Resistance Army and helped it to victory in 1986.
In 1990 they set up their own military force withUgandan help and occupied northern Rwanda.Following the Burundi massacres of 1993 the
Hutu leadership in Rwanda, threatened by the
invading Tutsi force in northern Rwanda, decided
on a ‘Final Solution’, the genocide of more than 2million Tutsis still living in Rwanda. When theplane in which the Rwandan prime minister was
travelling was shot down on 6 April 1994 the
Hutus launched the most horrific massacre in1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN CENTRAL AND EAST AFRICA743
Africa’s violent history. Although Tutsis andHutus had lived together in Rwanda as neighboursand many Tutsis had married Hutus, Hutu
extremists, armed with machetes, turned on the
Tutsis and hacked off the limbs of men, women
and children. 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutuswere butchered. The genocide could have beenprevented. The UN headquarters in New York
were sent warnings three months earlier that Tutsi
extremists were training death squads. Roméo
Dallaire, the UN commander in Rwanda, pleaded
to be allowed to act in time. Led by the US, Britainand France, the UN looked the other way. Deniedreinforcements for his 2,500 peacekeepers, when
the massacres started on 7 April, Dallaire’s coura-

geous Ghanaians and Tunisians could only save
several thousands, while hundreds of thousandsperished. The few Europeans were evacuated byair. The Tutsi armed force in northern Rwanda,
supported by Uganda, then struck back, speedily
defeated the Hutu army and took power in
Rwanda. In the early summer of 1994 it was theturn of the Hutus to ﬂee, many to the neighbour-
ing Congo. Over 1 million Hutu refugees, mur-

derers and innocents alike, were crammed together
in barren refugee camps, receiving basic humani-

tarian aid from the UN. Hutu militia terrorised the
camps, and organised raids into Rwanda.It took television cameras and a pop singer, BobGeldof, to rouse the world’s conscience for the
victims of famine in northern Ethiopia. Live Aid
concerts, watched by 1.5 billion people world-wide, raised £503 million for famine relief in1985. Ofﬁcial reactions followed rather than led
public opinion in the developed world. Animals in
the West were better fed than millions in Africa. In
the famines of 1984 and 1985 nearly 1 million
died. In the early 1990s drought and famine insub-Saharan Africa threatened millions of livesagain. Famine and starvation had become the rule
rather than the exception.Tanzania, unlike Uganda, was not beset byserious ethnic conﬂict. It is the largest of the EastAfrican countries and by far the poorest. No tribeis powerful enough to dominate the others, and
the Swahili language forms a common bond.
Here too African nomination to the colonialLegislative Council had to wait until the end ofthe Second World War. By 1960 a nationwideelection was held in preparation for independ-
ence from Britain. Dr Julius Nyerere and his
Tanganyikan African National Union (formed in
1954) swept the board. The ﬁrm unity evident inthe country facilitated rapid independence, whichwas achieved in December 1961. A new election
in 1962 followed, and Nyerere became president.
Nyerere stood for African Democratic Socialism,
which in practice meant a one-party state and a
radical form of socialism particularly suitable, soNyerere believed, for a people who would haveto pull themselves up by their bootstraps.The neighbouring island of Zanzibar with itsfeudal sultan and mixed Arab–African people of
Muslim faith was granted its own independenceby Britain in December 1963. A month later a744AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE

Magnum Photoscoup by Africans overthrew the Sultan’s govern-ment and put in its place a revolutionary councilwhich, in April 1964, announced union with
Tanganyika, now renamed Tanzania. Africans had
constituted four-fifths of the population of
Zanzibar, and many Arabs and Asians now ﬂed.On the mainland in the same year Nyerere facedhis own troubles when the army mutinied for
higher pay and better promotion, but with the
help of British troops he defeated the challenge.For twenty-eight years from 1962 Nyerere wasthe undisputed father and ‘teacher’ of the nation,until he retired in 1990 of his own free will. Hiswas an authoritarian paternalism that owed much
to Mao, whom he admired. Like Mao, Nyerere
was a scholar–leader, writing tracts to explain his
own socialist ideology to the people. His author-itarian rule was motivated by a humane utopianvision, which so often can lead to coercion and
control over the mass of the people who need
‘improving’. He justiﬁed the one-party state as
necessary to overcome class and ethnic division sothat everyone could strive together to overcomeignorance, hunger and disease. ‘War’ on these
evils, together with African self-reliance, were
what Nyerere propounded in his Arusha Decla-
ration of 1967. Economic development would
focus on basics – on agriculture rather than ongrandiose industrial projects. Tanzania would not make itself dependent on foreign invest-
ment. Following communist models, land was
collectivised and peasant families were brought
together into Africa ‘family villages’, often atsome distance from their land. When volun-tary exhortation proved inadequate, millions of
peasant families were relocated. The concentra-
tion on agricultural development and illiteracy
was sound enough, but everywhere in the world
peasants fail to produce when the land they cul-tivate is no longer their own. Nyerere’s newsociety did not raise standards of living. His major
success was the spread of elementary education
and literacy; another great plus was that his
country was not marred by political executions ormassacres.Authoritarian and visionary, Nyerere in retire-ment was held in respect and affection. His suc-
cessor President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, however,began to move away from the ideology of theone-party state. The US, indirectly the chiefprovider of ﬁnance through the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund, made its hos-
tility to one-party states felt. In the early 1980s
the corruption of the one-party state and social-ist planning were ruining the economy, includingagriculture, which employed 90 per cent of the
population and earned 80 per cent of foreign
exchange. Julius Nyerere, in a fashion typical of
black independence leaders imposing their ideol-
ogy, voluntarily stepped down from the presi-
dency but declared that he would continue toguide the country as chairman of the ruling party.
In 1990 he gave up the chairmanship as well.
Under its new president, Ali Hassan Mwinyi,
Tanzania began to move away from its ruinoussocialist experiments and turned to the West, tothe International Monetary Fund in Washington
for loans, and after 1986 had to accept the reme-
dies prescribed. Nyerere disapproved, but Mwinyi
became increasingly his own man and was re-elected for a ﬁve-year term as president in 1990.In 1991 cautious steps were taken to explore
whether Tanzania should liberalise politically as
well as economically.Kenya’s road to independence was very differentfrom Tanzania’s peaceful progress. Kenya was theone East African colony where a widespread and
bloodily suppressed insurrection preceded inde-
pendence. But this was not the only difference.
Kenya also had a signiﬁcant white settler pop-ulation that increased in size after 1945. Witha population at the time of independence of
nearly 10 million Africans, the 45,000 Europeans 
were, of course, signiﬁcant not in numbers but 
in political clout. There were far more Muslim
Arabs (35,000) and Indians (188,000), originallybrought in to build the Ugandan railway, butAsians and Arabs were not signiﬁcant in Whitehall
in the way the politically powerful white settlers
were.The foundations of colonial government wereundeniably racist. But the white settlers couldclaim that they had worked hard to make their
farms productive and had invested their lives 
and those of their families in becoming white 1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN CENTRAL AND EAST AFRICA745
Africans: Africa was now their homeland. On theother hand, only one-third of Kenya was fertile,and the highland plateau, the best of the land,
was until 1960 the exclusive preserve of the white
settlers. With the approach of independence the
settlers expected to preserve their privileges andto retain inﬂuence far beyond what their numberscould justify.The oldest of African political leaders camefrom Kenya. Jomo Kenyatta had been involved in
early African nationalist policies in the 1920s and,
when these were forbidden in the 1930s, came tostudy and live in Britain, where politics could notbe proscribed. In 1947, by then already an elder
statesman, he returned to Kenya to lead the
Kenya African National Union. His aim was to
win African majority rule constitutionally step bystep, beginning with an increase in the number ofAfricans on the Legislative Council. But a more
radical wing of the party – the Forty Group – was
determined to drive the British out by force.
Kenya’s political parties were largely ethnicallybased and the two most powerful groups were theKikuyu and the Luo. The Kenya African National
Union, which was predominantly Kikuyu, organ-
ised a rising in 1952. The Kikuyu had plenty of
grievances, in particular a desperate shortage 
of land. But there was also anger about discrimi-nation and the colour-bar; ex-servicemen hadalready experienced a different world of com-

radeship with white Europeans. Kikuyu national-
ism was strong too, and the oaths administered
to the Land Freedom Army deliberately harkedback to Kikuyu traditions. At the height of therebellion there were some 25,000 fighters in 
the forests. The British ruthlessly suppressed the
rebellion. The picture presented in Britain
depicted the valiant farmer, with a riﬂe across his
knees, protecting his family and homestead fromsavages crazed by the blood oaths of the secretMau Mau society to hack the whites to pieces
with their pangas. In reality during the four yearsof the rising less than seventy white people lost
their lives.The main victims were the Africans. Some90,000 Kikuyu men between the ages of sixteen
and thirty-ﬁve were herded by the authorities into
detention camps. One of these, the Hola camp,became notorious for beating and even murders.African soldiers ofﬁcered by the British meanwhiledefeated the guerrilla army. Black casualties on
both sides numbered some 18,000 and many
black African civilians died from malnutrition in
the forests. The governor, who had proclaimed anemergency, also arrested Kenyatta and the princi-pal leaders of the Kenya African National Union,
accusing them of having organised the Mau Mau.
Kenyatta was tried and sentenced in 1954 to hard
labour. It was a typical knee-jerk reaction. Once
the rising had been put down and the emergencyended in 1956, wiser counsels prevailed. The con-structive work of preparing Kenya for independ-
ence proceeded.In 1961 Kenyatta was released. In BritainHarold Macmillan was now prime minister.Always a realist and a progressive conservative,Macmillan recognised the futility of attempting to
perpetuate the privileges of a few thousand white
settlers at great cost to the British taxpayer. In
1960 at the end of a tour of Africa he deliveredhis famous ‘wind of change’ speech in CapeTown. The practical implications were soon
evident. The Kenyan highlands were opened to
African settlement, and restrictions on what the
Kikuyu could cultivate, such as coffee, were lifted.
Kenyatta resumed leadership of the Kenya AfricanNational Union. Ethnic political rivalries impededprogress for a time, but when Kenyatta’s KANU
in May 1963 won a majority, complicated plans
for a federal structure were abandoned and
Kenyatta was honoured as prime minister. Thiswas the last staging post on the road to inde-pendence, which was duly accorded in December
1963.During the Mau Mau struggle, rival politi-
cians, Oginga Odinga (a Luo) and Tom Mboya,
had come to the fore, but Kenyatta’s personalityand reputation dominated the country. For someyears ethnic politics continued to create distur-
bance, which Kenyatta countered by setting up a
one-party state. By the close of the 1960s his two
principal rivals had been eliminated: Tom Mboyahad been assassinated and Odinga detained.Kenyatta encouraged foreign investment andcapitalism, but this was capitalism with the African
difference that it was state-dominated. The state746AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
played a guiding role in agriculture too, and for-mulated national plans. Kenya at the time of inde-
pendence was the most commercially advanced of
the three East African nations. Agriculture pro-
vided the main source of exports, especially coffee,
tea and dairy produce. With Kenyatta placingnational interests above the desire for revenge, theEuropeans were encouraged to stay and to help
the new African country with their knowledge and
expertise. Not so the Asians, who played a leading
role in trade; confronted by Kenya’s efforts toAfricanise, they were driven out and many thou-sands holding British passports settled in Britain.
Kenyatta encouraged private investment, and for-
eigners were attracted to invest in this one black
country which was politically stable, aligned with
the West and opposed to communism.The mixed free and state economy overall didwell until the mid-1970s, although agricultural
and industrial progress was uneven. But with one
of the fastest-growing populations in Africa the
loss of Asian enterprise was a serious setback.Worse still was the growing corruption of those inpower during the Kenyatta years from 1963 to
1978, an inevitable consequence of one-party rule.On Kenyatta’s death in 1978, Daniel arapMoi, the vice-president, came to power, andmaintained the one-party rule of the KenyaAfrican National Union. Economic growth after
1984 was one of the best in black Africa and at
5 per cent kept ahead of the annual population
growth of 3.5 per cent. But Moi developed his
own style of authoritarian rule and cowed allopposition. Even by African standards his one-party regime was particularly repressive. There
occurred the murder of the respected foreignminister, Robert Ouko, in 1990 after he hadattacked government corruption – the results of
an investigation were not made public and a gov-
ernment cover-up was suspected. Pressure on Moi
increased in Kenya and abroad. In December
1991 he allowed the constitution to be changedto allow the establishment of other politicalparties. It was not clear whether genuine political
reform would develop from these reluctant begin-
nings. Stiﬂing bureaucracy and widespread cor-
ruption were making Kenya less attractive toforeign investors. Moi attributed Kenya’s bettereconomic performance to the one-party state and
continued to resist Western pressure to introduce
democratic reforms.David arap Moi ruled Kenya for twenty-four years with increasing corruption. A dividedopposition allowed Moi to hold on to powerdespite the multi-party constitution. Change
came slowly. His vice-president, the academically
trained Mwai Kibaki, left the party and organised
the first real opposition, challenging Moi butlosing in the 1992 election. But a decade later,Kibaki finally won a convincing majority. In
December 2002 the people of Kenya experienced
democratic change for the ﬁrst time since inde-
pendence. Kibaki promised to ﬁght corruptionand to better the lot of the people. He faced aformidable challenge to root out the favoured
elite of Moi’s misrule. The only question is
whether in time they will be replaced by another
corrupt elite of Kibaki’s choosing. It is the African
people who have suffered the dreams and hopesof independence in stark contrast to the realitiesof life, which a ﬂag, a national anthem and a
national airline do nothing to soften.1FREEDOM AND CONFLICT IN CENTRAL AND EAST AFRICA747

Much of the land is desert, and rainfall is uncer-tain, so that surviving even at subsistence level is
difficult. Famine has stalked the region and
claimed more than a million lives. Five millionremained in danger in the early 1990s. OnlyLibya has reaped untold riches from below this
desert, in the form of oil, but it fell under the
maverick rule of Colonel Gaddaﬁ, who properly
used a part of these riches to beneﬁt the Libyans
but also fanned conﬂict among his neighboursand elsewhere in the world. Gaddaﬁremained
unpredictable. Libya’s wealth did not help the
whole region; indeed, its neighbours Chad and
Somalia are among the poorest in Africa.
Authoritarian regimes in Ethiopia and Somalia,characterised by corruption and economic mis-management, added to the misery. But it was,
above all, the tribal and civil wars of the region
that were responsible for the sufferings of millions
of helpless people. Precious resources and aid
were used to pay for weapons to ﬁght these wars.The West and East, when their priorities were dic-tated by the Cold War, supplied them. Yet these
were the countries ‘liberated’ by the United
Nations from European colonial rule, their inde-
pendence intended to signal a new era for thesuppressed peoples of the world. What went sodreadfully wrong?The ﬁrst African nation rescued from colonialdependency was Ethiopia (then called Abyssinia),
thanks to the internecine Second World Warbetween the European colonial powers. In 1941it was liberated from Italian occupation, whichhad begun in 1936, and Haile Selassie was
restored as feudal emperor. Ethiopia alone had
successfully resisted by force of arms Europeancolonial partition in the nineteenth century as theItalian army, advancing inland from the colony of
Eritrea on the Red Sea, was defeated in 1896.
When Haile Selassie returned in 1941 he bene-
ﬁted from the modernisation and centralisation of
the Italian occupation and launched an Ethiopiandrive to try to bring his backward kingdom intothe twentieth century. Progress was impressive in
education, and a small start was made in setting
up some factories and in industrialising. With the
assistance of the US a properly equipped andtrained army was created. These developments,however, undermined the old structures of the
monarchial state. By the early 1970s new shocks
resulted in government and society falling apart.The year 1973 proved disastrous. The rise inoil prices hit the poorest countries especially hard. This coincided with a calamitous drought.There was famine in the Tigray province and the
royal army was defeated by Eritrean freedom
ﬁghters. The rising, which turned into revolution,
began in the spring of 1974. Behind it was agroup of officers, army mutineers, who werejoined by students and teachers in the capital,
Addis Ababa. Gradually the revolution became
more radical. The 83-year-old emperor was
deposed in September 1974 and imprisoned; laterhe and his family were murdered. Strife within theChapter 65WAR AND FAMINE IN THE HORN 
OF AFRICAmilitary and among the radical groups followeduntil in February 1977 Colonel Haile Mengistueventually emerged as the victor and unleashed 
a reign of terror; opponents were rounded up 
and summarily executed. Assuming the red star
and the trappings of a Marxist people’s republic,he wielded absolute power over the political andeconomic life of the country and crushed his
opponents as enemies of the revolution.The Soviet Union saw here an opportunity toadvance its inﬂuence in a region of Africa bor-
dering on the Red Sea, which was of obviousstrategic significance. Moscow cynically hailedMengistu’s seizure of power as a truly ‘Bolshevik’
revolution and provided arms and aid. Mean-
while the internal divisions in the country and
Mengistu’s dictatorship had one other result: theresumption of ﬁerce ﬁghting between the centralPolitburo in Addis Ababa and outlying Eritrea, a
province attached to Ethiopia after the Second
World War. Faced with Eritreans in the north 
and with Somalis in the south-east, Mengistudepended on Soviet weapons and military train-ing. The demands of the military, the devastation
of the endless warfare over a disputed frontier
with Somalia, and the Eritrean war of liberation
condemned the Ethiopian people to one of the
lowest standards of living in Africa. Periodicfamines killed hundreds of thousands and threat-ened the lives of millions more. Television cameras
revealed the terrible scenes of hunger to the hor-
riﬁed West in 1984 and 1985. But spectacular
public responses, such as Band Aid organised bya pop singer, to provide cash for the starving couldnot attack the roots of the problem – the cor-
ruption and mismanagement of Mengistu’s dic-
tatorial regime added to the continuous warfare
in the Tigray and with Eritrea and Somalia.It was already too late when on 5 March 1990Mengistu declared that the state would abandonMarxism–Leninism. In May of the following year,
the game was up: the rebel forces were closing in.
The coalition led by the People’s Revolutionary
Democratic Front captured Addis Ababa. By thattime Mengistu had ﬂed to safety in Zimbabwe.The guerrillas had overcome a 350,000-strong,
seemingly modern army and air force equipped
with weapons supplied formerly by the SovietUnion. The old ally had deserted Mengistu andthe army was demoralised. After seventeen yearsMengistu had lost all credibility.Threatened by the turmoil were a group ofblack Ethiopians professing as their religion a
form of ancient Judaism. The Ethiopians calledthem ‘strangers’, Falashas. Some 140,000 – thatis, most of those who had remained after the ﬁrst
airlift in 1984 – were now rescued, plucked out
of Africa and brought to Israel. The Israelis 
had once more demonstrated to the world that
they would protect their own, regardless of allother considerations – economic, international,political and social. Black Jews would be inte-
grated into Israel like Jews from all other conti-
nents, races and ethnic groups. Service in the
army and education of a new generation woulddo their work.The new leaders in Ethiopia faced a dauntingtask in their attempts to revive a devastated coun-
try. At least they were no longer at war with
Eritrea, whose independence was in sight. As if itsown problems were not enough to cope with,Ethiopia was also attempting to feed hundreds of
thousands of refugees fleeing from southern
Sudan.In the early 1990s, Eritrea had a population of3.5 million. The country had been forciblycolonised by Abyssinians, by Turks and ﬁnally in1889 by the Italians. Italian colonies were run
mainly for the beneﬁt of Italy, so local national-
ist feelings were suppressed. ‘Liberated’ by the
British in 1941, Eritrea was not granted inde-pendence, despite wartime promises. In fact,there were long wrangles after the war between
the victors about what to do with the former
Italian colonies. The British and the French could
not simply take them over as new colonies, as
spoils of war. The climate prevailing at the UnitedNations would not have permitted such blatantcolonialism. There was only one thing on which
the Western victors were agreed and that was to
keep the Soviet Union out. Eventually, in 1951,
the former Italian colony of Libya was grantedindependence.The Eritreans fared the worst. By a UN reso-lution, they were to be assured respect for ‘their
institutions, traditions, religions, and languages,1WAR AND FAMINE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA749
as well as the widest possible measure of self-government’. Instead, they were federated withEthiopia, so that Ethiopia might have access 
to the sea. The dominant West at the United
Nations believed it had a secure ally in Haile
Selassie, and the Red Sea was too importantstrategically to allow a small Eritrean state inde-pendence, and so, decisive inﬂuence. The Eritrean
Liberation Movement was soon formed, only 
to be brutally suppressed, and in 1962 Haile
Selassie annexed Eritrea. With the assistance of
Arab neighbours, the newly founded EritreanLiberation Front took up the armed struggleagainst Ethiopia in the 1960s and, despite splits
and intrigues, fought the longest war in Africa
until Mengistu’s overthrow in 1991. South of
Eritrea lies northern Ethiopia, inhabited by theTigray peoples, some 5 million strong. They toowaged a liberation struggle against Mengistu’s
rule. Droughts and fighting devastated subsis-

tence agriculture, so that famines decimated the
Tigreans. At the same time, the Ethiopians wereﬁghting the Republic of Somalia over the terri-tory known as the Ogaden. The new rulers of
Ethiopia brought peace to the country. The
regions enjoyed some autonomy; when a referen-
dum was held, Eritrea overwhelmingly chose
independence in 1993. All this gave a chance forfamine relief to reach starving peoples. Two of thepoorest countries in Africa, Ethiopia and Eritrea,
wasted their scarce resources ﬁghting each other.
War between them seemed least likely at the
outset after the overthrow of the Marxist regimein Ethiopia in 1991. The Eritrean presidentIssajas Afwerki and the Ethiopian new prime 
minister of Ethiopia Meles Zenawi had been rebel
comrades in arms when they ousted the dictator
Mengistu. The separation of the two countries in
1993 allowing Eritrea independence had beenpeaceful. The delimitation of the new frontier,neither country willing to lose authority by com-
promise over a small area of land, spluttered into
war in 1998. War forced hundreds of thousands
of the poorest farmers to ﬂee from the ﬁghtingzones and face starvation. UN intervention, thedespatch of peacekeepers, mediation leading to an
agreement to submit the border dispute to an
international commission ended ﬁghting in 2000,but when in March 2003 the commissionawarded the disputed village and the inhospitableland surrounding it to Eritrea, Meles Zenawi
refused to accept the finding. War threatened
once more. Pride, nationalism and sheer folly
condemned tens of thousands to die. Withoutsubstantial food aid another mass famine inEthiopia and Eritrea threatens thousands of lives.The Republic of Somalia was created in 1960 fromthe Italian and British colonies of Somaliland.
Somalians share language, culture and Islam, andnationalism is a strong force, able to survive thecolonial partitions by Italy, Britain and France.
The Ogaden had been conquered by the
Abyssinians in the 1890s, and after the Second
World War it was once more handed back toEthiopia. Conflict between the two countriesarose soon after the establishment of Somali inde-
pendence. In 1969 there was a military revolution
in Somalia, which received Soviet support, but
when Somalia and Ethiopia went to war again in 1977 the Soviet Union – forced to choosebetween two of its clients – eventually backed the
stronger Mengistu. The Somali army was defeated
in the Ogaden in 1978. The US meanwhile
replaced the USSR in Somalia.Thus internal strife in the strategically import-ant Horn of Africa led to a Cold War game ofmusical chairs. Nothing illustrates better the hol-
lowness of the pretensions of these African mili-
tary regimes when they claim they are following
‘democratic free world’ principles of governmentor modelling themselves on the Marxist people’srepublics. The politics of Africa reﬂect African

realities: the ﬁrst requirement of leadership is to
stay in power and to maintain the cohesion of the
new nation. The Somali Democratic Republic was
ruled by a Supreme Revolutionary Council underits president, General Mohammed Barre, until his downfall in 1991. Warfare and internal strife
had reduced this poorest of African countries,
dependent on subsistence agriculture, to near
starvation. In 1990 the country descended intochaos, with Barre trying ruthlessly to hold ittogether by using his elite guards.In January 1991 Barre was driven from power.Even worse was in store for the people of Somalia750AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
than Barre’s brutal rule. Although the 6 millionSomalis are almost unique in Africa in formingone nation, all speaking one language and fol-
lowing the same religion, a Sunni branch of
Islam, clans had fought each other for centuries
over ownership of pastures, and Barre’s rule – farfrom eradicating the clan rivalries – had only sup-pressed them. Now, like a release of steam from
a pressure cooker, clans, local warlords and gangs
erupted in an orgy of civil conﬂict. The country
was awash in weapons.The rest of the world was horriﬁed by the tele-vision reports sent from the capital, Mogadishu,a ruined city in which over a million were seeking
some sort of shelter. The UN and relief agencies
sent in food aid to the starving population, but a
few hundred ‘blue berets’ – UN troops – weretotally inadequate to guard the supplies and to seethat emergency supplies reached the people. For
hundreds of thousands who had starved to death,
it was already too late.Somalia presents a most pitiable face of con-temporary Africa. Independence led to dictatorialrule, corruption and the lavishing of scarce
resources on armaments. The end of dictatorship
was followed not by a transition to democracy but
by chaos, anarchy and ruin. A more determined
international effort, which got under way in theautumn of 1992, endeavoured to save some 2million Somalis from starvation. After the ill-
planned US intervention in October 1993 to
impose peace on the warring factions had failed
so humiliatingly, Somalia was left to its warlords.If they cannot reach a peace between them, noother nation was willing to risk its soldiers to
pacify the Somalian cauldron. The UN, the bodyof last resort provided some aid. Despite all itsefforts Somalia has remained a fractured, brokencountry.Bordering the Red Sea to the north-west ofEthiopia lies the Sudan, where starving peoplesfrom the Tigray and Eritrea found refuge. In oneof the most extraordinary migrations thousands of
Ethiopian Jews, the Falashas, also crossed into the
Sudan (1983–4) on their secret journey to Israel.
The Sudan provides the main route through
which aid can be channelled to Eritrea andTigray, but it is not itself a stable country polit-ically or ethnically. The south is African and vehe-
mently opposes the spread of the Muslim religion
and law, which the Arab north of the country
seeks to impose. When the Sudan gained inde-pendence from Britain in January 1956, para-
mount British consideration had been to prevent
Nasser’s Egypt from dominating it, but it was 
left to the Sudanese to decide the issue. A rebel-
lion in the south in the summer of 1955, moti-vated by the fear that all power would in practicebe transferred to the north, was repressed and did
not delay independence. Britain was in a hurry
and failed to insist on safeguards for the south.
British Middle Eastern policy required strong,
uniﬁed nations, not weak political divisions thatmight be exploited by the Soviet Union.After a short period of multi-party governmentin the Sudan, the military seized power in 1958
and ruled for the next six years. General Abboud’s
regime followed a harsh policy of Arabisation,established Koranic schools in the south andexpelled Christian missionaries. In 1962 a civil
war began that was to cause destruction and great1WAR AND FAMINE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA751

loss of life among the southern people. After asecond brief civilian interlude, another militarycoup in 1969 brought Colonel Jaafar al-Nimeiri
to power. His more conciliatory approach en-
abled the ﬁghting in the south to be brought to
an end in 1972. But a renewed attempt in 1983to force Muslim law and custom on the south led to a fresh outbreak of ﬁghting. The endem-
ic north–south conflict in the Sudan and its 
unstable political conditions have added to the
immense problems of a country whose vagaries 
of climate hinder agricultural production, while arapidly expanding population requires more notless food. Devastating floods in August 1988
made 2 million homeless.In June 1989, after months of turmoil, a military coup overturned the government andGeneral Omar Hasan Ahmed al-Bashir becamehead of state and commander-in-chief at the head
of a Revolutionary Council of National Salvation.
Political parties were dissolved and many politi-
cians and professional people were detained. Theregime was ruthless in dealing with its opponentsand potential enemies. Attempted coups in 1990
and 1991 led to the execution of the army ofﬁ-
cers involved, but protests continued. Behind the
army stood the National Islamic Front of funda-
mentalist Muslims led by Hasgan Turabi. Islamiccriminal law, the sharia, was applied again.Khartoum became ﬁlled with some 1.8 million
refugees, possessing practically nothing, and half
a million more were forcibly settled outside the
city. The civil war between north and south con-tinued. The non-Muslim south, African, Christianand Animist (a religion which holds that both
living and inanimate objects have souls) was in a
desperate condition with widespread famine
added to the civil war and preventing relief agen-
cies from reaching the starving. The Sudan wasseen as a hotbed of terrorism. Osama bin Ladenorganised from there the devastating simultane-
ous car bombing of the US embassies in 1998.
The frontiers have remained porous for terrorists.
But the expulsion of Osama bin Laden who thenwent to Afghanistan was an early indication ofchange. As the Sudan entered the new millen-
nium Islamist extremism softened. Turabi fell
from grace and was placed under house arrest.The Bashir regime was trying to lose its pariahstatus. The regime after a decade and a half feltmore secure. Oil was discovered and exported and
provided badly needed funds for new technology.
The European Union now increasingly ‘engaged’
the Sudanese regime but US sanctions imposedin 1997 still remained in place too. The key tobetter relations is to bring to an end the war in
the south with its human-rights violations and
loss of life from ﬁghting and starvation. More
than a million people have perished. The Sudan
has known only eleven years of peace in the ﬁvedecades that have passed since independence. Inthe south the main rebel group, the Sudan
People’s Liberation Army, is faced with the stark
choice of famine and depopulation or an accom-
modation with the north. Foreign pressure andmediation secured a ceaseﬁre in February 2003with hopes for a more durable peace later that
year only for a new conﬂict to break out in the
Darfur region of western Sudan.Libya is the richest country in Africa. In 1951 itbecame the ﬁrst African state to exchange colonial
status for independence. This was not because it
was advanced in any way. During the Second
World War, the Italian colonial territories of
Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were conquered by theBritish Eighth Army. Britain’s main concern was toensure that the Russians would not secure a
foothold by claiming a share in the trusteeship of
the Italian colonies. So the provinces were com-

bined on independence with French-administeredFezzan to form Libya, and the head of the mostpowerful Cyrenaican family, Emir Mohammed
Idris, whose conservatism could be trusted, was
elevated to become King Idris. It was not an ideal
solution from a Western point of view. Britain and
Italy would have preferred a long period of trustee-
ship, but at the UN the Arabs and their allies wereable to push independence through. Idris fulﬁlled

Western expectations and permitted the construc-

tion of a huge NATO airbase on the outskirts of
Tripoli. No one dreamt of the wealth the discoveryof oil would bring to the desert kingdom or thetrouble it would later cause the West.Libya began exporting oil in 1961. By thenNasser had changed the politics of the Middle752AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
East and, after Suez, British and French imperial-ism was on the retreat. These transformationsaffected the students and junior ofﬁcers of Libya,
who were drawn to socialist ideas and to a revival
of Muslim values, at the same time as they felt
increasing antipathy towards Western, especiallyAmerican, military and commercial domination.In September 1969, a 29-year-old ofﬁcer, Major
Muammar Gaddaﬁ, overthrew the regime of King
Idris. He had long planned the coup as a neces-
sary step to freeing Libya from foreign exploita-
tion and raising the Arab peoples to live their livesaccording to the teachings of the Koran. All thepeoples of Libya, those of the oases as well as
those of the towns, should share in Libya’s pros-
perity. Gaddafi expounded his ideology in his
Green Book. His ‘Third Universal Theory’rejected the Western ideologies of capitalism andcommunism, as well as the concept of the ‘state’.
The masses should rule through local people’s
committees, and life should be conducted accord-
ing to Muslim law. In practice Gaddaﬁwas the
supreme ruler, though fellow officers in theGeneral People’s Committee may from time to
time have exerted some inﬂuence on policy.In developing Libya economically, Gaddaﬁwas
shrewd. In 1971 he led the oil-rich states in a pol-
icy of forcing the Western consumers to pay vastlymore for the oil they had hitherto obtained socheaply. The riches this bestowed on Libya were
used for agricultural development and industrial
diversiﬁcation. They also enabled Gaddaﬁto cre-

ate an Arab welfare state. Thus the oil incomebrought considerable beneﬁt to the people.Gaddaﬁ’s relations with the rest of the worldwere warped by an uncompromising revolutionary
zeal. Foreign bases were closed down and theWestern military presence expelled. In the 1970sand 1980s Gaddaﬁintervened in the ethnic civil
war in Chad, backing the northerners against the
southerners and occupying part of northern Chad.
The government in the south was saved only by
French intervention. But Gaddafi’s notoriety in the West mainly derived from his support forterrorist groups, ranging from factions of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation to the IRA. A
terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub which left
American servicemen dead was followed in April
1986 by an American attempt to silence Gaddaﬁfor good by bombing his living quarters and mili-tary targets. They missed Gaddaﬁbut caused civil-

ian casualties. The intended ‘surgical’ air strikes,
using British bases, were widely condemned, but
Gaddaﬁ’s support for terrorism became less overt.Since the 1990s Gaddaﬁhas moderated his
radical rhetoric. After many years he delivered to
international justice the perpetrators of the down-
ing over Scotland of Pan Am ﬂight 103. Gaddaﬁis

well aware the way the wind is blowing; theenmity of the US and the West can do great harmto the country dependent on exporting oil. In
2003 Gaddafi accepted responsibility for the
downing of ﬂight 103 and was ready to pay com-
pensation. Negotiations to lift international sanc-
tions were now initiated by the US and Britain.Supporting terror did not pay. Gaddaﬁin the new
millennium has turned more to Africa, posturing
as Africa’s elder statesman, a champion of African
unity. The revolutionary fervour subdued, the
megalomania of earlier years was replaced by amore realistic appraisal of the world. Gaddaﬁgave
up attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruc-
tion in 2004 and sanctions were lifted. The West
is now reviving her oil industry.1WAR AND FAMINE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA753
In African countries with substantial minorities ofwhite settlers, resistance to African majority rule
led to savage conﬂicts and wars. By the early
1990s the white settlers had lost power in all butone country; the future of South Africa still hungin the balance as turmoil threatened. Two decades
earlier another powerful group of ruling white
settlers in Rhodesia had fought to resist an early
end to their dominance. Despite their over-

whelming military resources, they had to acceptdefeat in the end. Southern Rhodesia becameZimbabwe, Nyasaland was renamed Malawi and
Northern Rhodesia, Zambia.Cecil Rhodes had ﬁrst conquered these terri-tories towards the close of the nineteenth centuryfor the British South Africa Company. White set-tlers soon came to the healthy highlands of
Southern and Northern Rhodesia. Nyasaland,
administered directly by the Colonial Ofﬁce in
London, attracted fewer settlers. Northern
Rhodesia, which in 1924 likewise fell to directadministration by the Colonial Ofﬁce, had a singlerich resource to exploit – the Copperbelt, whose
mines produced the second-largest quantity of
copper in the world. At the time, with only 4,000
whites among 900,000 Africans, there could beno question of handing over power to the set-tlers. In 1929 a British colonial secretary declared
that in Northern Rhodesia, as in the East African
territories, the interests of the Africans were para-
mount. In practice this meant little. The land dis-tribution favoured the white minority at theexpense of the expanding African population. Butthe white settlers in Northern Rhodesia wanted
to make their position more secure. That was the
logic behind their desire to create a union betweenNorthern and Southern Rhodesia, with its largerwhite-settler community.The conquest of Rhodesia in the 1890s hadbeen brutal. As the railway moved further inland,
settlers followed. There was some gold, but agri-
culture gradually became far more important. Theassumption always was that when the white set-tlers were ready to govern the country they would
take over from the Chartered British South Africa
Company. The decisive year was 1923, when the
34,000 settlers of Southern Rhodesia rejectedunion with South Africa and were granted fullinternal self-government, which meant ruling
over 900,000 Africans. Constitutionally, South-
ern Rhodesia became a Crown colony with the
imperial government reserving to itself the right
to veto legislation affecting the African majority.During the next three decades London allowedthe Southern Rhodesian whites to run the country
as they thought ﬁt. The African majority had to
accept white rule and subservience to unjust laws.
The best lands went to the white settlers, a socialsystem that effectively amounted to apartheid wasenacted. The Land Apportionment Act in 1931
forbade Africans to occupy land in white areas;
50,000 whites were to receive 49 million acres
and nearly 1 million Africans were to receive 29million acres. Pass laws, taxes, control of AfricansChapter 66SOUTHERN AFRICAFROM WHITE SUPREMACY TO DEMOCRACYin towns and the Masters and Servants Act allensured black subservience. A ban on blackworkers forming trade unions, separate schools,
hospitals, clubs and swimming pools for black
people were all just part of an extensive structure
of discrimination. Black Africans were in practicedeprived of the vote as the settlers made sure thatthe black citizens would not be able to meet the
franchise qualiﬁcation.But Southern Rhodesia appeared to be pros-
perous and orderly. There were a few strikes but
they were easily dealt with. With the army and airforce under white command, the position of thesettlers seemed impregnable in the 1950s. White
immigrants poured in, attracted by the new life in
the beautiful highlands away from overcrowded
Europe. Southern Rhodesia seemed to haveadvanced to the stage of gaining independentDominion status. The prospects were enhanced
when the white settlers persuaded the British gov-

ernment to permit all three territories, Northern
Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, toform a federation in 1953, with a federal govern-
ment in Salisbury. The African majority were
granted a few parliamentary seats in the new
federal parliament, some civil service posts, even a
black minister to make the transfer to independ-

ence more acceptable. There was some genuinebut limited progress, such as a multiracial univer-
sity in Salisbury where black students could qualify
as doctors, their degrees being authenticated by
the University of Birmingham in England. These
gestures to black Africans merely revealed the con-
ﬁdence with which the white settlers felt that theywould continue to rule the country for at least
another hundred years. It went about as far as the
white settlers were ready to go. Few at the time
foresaw how rapidly the tide was turning. Indeed,
black majority rule would have come much soonerthan the twenty-seven years it took to achieve. Itwas delayed after 1963 because of the armed resis-

tance of the white settlers.Black political stirrings had come relativelylate, so powerfully entrenched did the white posi-tion appear to be to black Africans. The ﬁrst blacknationalist target was the Federation, with its
offer of an unequal partnership. Joshua Nkomo
was the elder statesman among black Africanpoliticians, although only forty-five years old. As general secretary of the Railway Workers’Association he had become known as an African
leader. He was also a Methodist lay preacher who
did not believe in violence and worked for com-
promise and gradual reform. Nkomo led theSouthern Rhodesian African National Congress.It won support from the African masses deprived
of land and a fair share of the country’s wealth.
The reaction of the Rhodesian government 
was repression. In 1954 several hundred black
Africans were arrested. The African NationalCongress was banned and harsh laws against ‘sub-version’ were enacted. In the hope of reducing
support for radical black policies the discrimina-
tion laws were modiﬁed. Would this be sufﬁcient
to satisfy the black people and persuade Britain togive up its suzerain right, which included protec-tion of the black population? London had done
little to help black Rhodesians anyway. Black
West Africa was being granted independence; 
it surely could not now be denied to whiteRhodesia. But times had changed, passing mostwhite Rhodesians by. In London black national-
ist views were no longer ignored: 1960 was the
year of Harold Macmillan’s famous ‘wind of
change’ speech.In Southern Rhodesia a new black politicalparty was formed, the National Democratic Party,led by Ndabaningi Sithole, Robert Mugabe and
Herbert Chitepo. Joshua Nkomo acted ﬁrst as the
NDP’s spokesman in London, and later as its
president. With black West Africa and East Africaeither independent or on the road to independ-ence on the constitutional basis of one man one
vote, black African nationalist leaders saw no just
reason why the same principle should not apply
to the three territories of the Federation. Since
the white-settler population in Nyasaland of72,000 in 1960 was much smaller than the whitepopulation in Southern Rhodesia black national-
ists calculated that progress towards majority
black rule would be easier to achieve in the north.
In the federal parliament, with its overwhelmingwhite Southern Rhodesian inﬂuence black nation-alism would ﬁnd the struggle harder. They there-
fore launched a campaign to break up the Central
African Federation as a necessary step towards1SOUTHERN AFRICA755
gaining the independence of Nyasaland andNorthern Rhodesia under black majority rule.The Federation had been imposed on theAfricans in 1953, but there was a promise to
review its workings after ten years. The national-
ist movement in Northern Rhodesia was led byHenry Nkumbula and Kenneth Kaunda, and thatin Nyasaland by Dr Hastings Banda. In London
the prime minister Harold Macmillan was deter-
mined to settle what could be settled. Britain
already had enough trouble on its hands with
Kenya and the Mau Mau rising. It had requireda major and costly British effort to suppress it.Southern Rhodesia presented severe problems
with its many white settlers, but the position was
different in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. A
few thousand white settlers in those two countrieswould not be allowed to stand in the way of asettlement with African nationalism there. A
British fact-ﬁnding commission was sent to the
two territories and found the majority of Africans
opposed to the Central African Federation. InDecember 1963 the Federation was dissolved. InJuly 1964 Nyasaland, later called Malawi, was
granted independence and in October of the same
year so too was Northern Rhodesia, renamed
Zambia by the African leadership.This left the intractable problem of SouthernRhodesia. The federal armed forces now fell underthe command of Southern Rhodesia and, although
small, they were formidable, equipped with
Hunter jets, Vampire and Canberra bombers,
artillery, armoured cars and helicopters. The armyconsisted of 3,500 men of whom 1,000 were blackAfricans. It is one of the worst features of white
supremacy that it pitted the indigenous peoples
against each other, blacks against blacks. This force
could maintain white rule for years. The struggle
for supremacy in Rhodesia was waged in the 1960sand 1970s between black nationalists (who werethemselves split but were aided by black African
neighbours) and the white settlers. Britain’s im-
perial role was invidious. London could deny
Rhodesia formal independence but no govern-
ment, whether Conservative or Labour, was in aposition to use military force against the Rhodesian
authorities. British public opinion would not have
tolerated ﬁghting white Rhodesians, the men whoduring the Second World War had rallied toBritain’s side. However racist this attitude maynow be judged, it was an inexorable fact facing suc-

cessive prime ministers – Macmillan, Home,
Wilson, Heath, Callaghan and Thatcher. The next
best thing was to try to mediate a general constitu-
tional settlement which the settlers and the blackAfricans could be persuaded to accept. The only
pressure that could be exerted from outside was
economic sanctions through the United Nations
and the Commonwealth.From 1961 to 1971, repeated efforts weremade by British governments to grant SouthernRhodesia independence on terms acceptable to a
black majority and the Rhodesian whites. Ian
Smith, an ex-RAF ﬁghter pilot, was the tough set-

tler leader of the Rhodesian Front Party. A settle-
ment acceptable to him would have to fall short ofequal votes for all Rhodesians and immediate black
majority rule. Would the African nationalists
accept less? Nkomo made the mistake of doing just
that at a constitutional conference held in 1961under British auspices. The proposed constitutionthat emerged would have delayed African majority
rule for many decades, perhaps for ever. But the
British government seized this opportunity to give
up practically all its reserve powers, except for the
ﬁnal acceptance of Rhodesian independence. TheAfrican nationalists, who had organised themselvesinto a new party – the National Democratic Party
– repudiated the agreement and Nkomo was
forced to accept this reverse. One man one vote
now became the unyielding demand of the blacknationalists. When the Smith administration thenbanned the National Democratic Party, this simply
led to the creation of a new African grouping, the
Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU). In
1963 distrust of Nkomo’s leadership caused a split
– Ndabaningi Sithole formed a more radicalZimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). Thesplit gravely weakened African political inﬂuence

during the struggle for independence. In 1965
Smith decided to cut the Gordian knot and
declared Rhodesia unilaterally independent(UDI). It appeared intolerable to the white settlersthat their two neighbours should have been
granted independence in 1964, as Zambia and
Malawi, but their own country had not.756AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
The British government and Ian Smith mighthave been able to reach a fudged agreement evenafter UDI, which was denied British and inter-
national recognition. Negotiations were resumed
on the basis of ‘five principles’: unimpeded
progress to majority rule; guarantees against ret-rogressive amendments to the constitution;immediate improvement in the political status of
the African population; progress towards ending
racial discrimination; British satisfaction that pro-
posals for independence agreed upon by Britain
and the white settlers were acceptable to thepeople of Rhodesia as a whole. But how manyyears would have to elapse before the black
Africans gained majority rule? Smith declared in
1968 after meeting Wilson, ‘There will be no
majority rule in my lifetime – or in my children’s.’That clearly was totally unacceptable to blacknationalist leaders. In 1969, Smith’s Rhodesian
parliament imposed a constitution that allowed
greater African participation and promised even-
tual ‘parity’, but ‘eventual’ in the light of Smith’stimescale was a prospect beyond the horizon.Smith simply condemned black nationalists as
communists and criminals, many of whom had
been safely detained. He argued that to allow
black majority rule would be a catastrophe for the
country, as it had already turned out to be in theCongo and Uganda. Smith’s Rhodesia at thistime, he claimed, was a country of law and order,
of economic development despite sanctions,
thanks to the help of South Africa and Portugal.
The black Africans, too, would beneﬁt more fromprogress under white rule than from chaos underblack.In 1971 Smith’s tenacity appeared to have paidoff. The Conservative government now in power
made a new attempt to reach a settlement with
him. After lengthy negotiations, the ﬁve principles– somewhat watered down – became the basis ofan agreement between the rebellious Rhodesian
government and Britain. On the crucial issue of
majority rule, the timescale was to be left to the
white Rhodesians. There were objections to thisfrom Nkomo, Sithole and other nationalistAfricans who were still being detained. London
and Salisbury nevertheless proceeded to test black
opinion. In 1972 a British commission was sentout. Their findings shattered illusions in bothBritain and Rhodesia. The commission unequivo-cally concluded that the ‘people of Rhodesia as a
whole’ rejected the proposed settlement.The two outlawed African nationalist partiesZANU and ZAPU were faced with liberating blackRhodesia by force, since the British governmentseemed powerless. With a few hundred guerrillas
from bases in Mozambique and Zambia the task
looked hopeless. ZAPU looked to Moscow, and
ZANU guerrillas received their training and arms
in Algeria, Ghana, China and Czechoslovakia –assistance that enabled Smith to denounce them ascommunists. The black peasants in the north-east
of the country became victims of the brutal warfare
between the guerrillas and the security forces. Not
until the mid-1970s did the guerrillas make anyprogress. And by 1974, Ian Smith was more readyfor compromise with the African leadership inside
and outside Rhodesia than he had been in the
1960s. The coup in Lisbon that year had under-

mined Portuguese determination to remain inMozambique; South Africa began to be anxious to dissociate itself from Rhodesia, whose actions
had been condemned by the United Nations.
Sanctions too were taking their toll. So Smith
negotiated with Kaunda of Zambia and released
the black leadership, including Nkomo, Sitholeand Mugabe. But new negotiations failed. Mugabejoined the guerrillas.Sanctions and the settlers’ fears for the futurewere now sapping settler morale. ZAPU and
ZANU increased the pressure by temporarilyburying their differences and forming thePatriotic Front. Though the Rhodesian forces
could still inﬂict terrible damage on the guerrillas
and pursued them to their bases, resistance could
not be extinguished. Smith again tried to reach a
settlement by negotiation with the black nation-alists. He was prepared to make major conces-sions. In March 1978, a power-sharing ‘internal
agreement’ was actually reached between Ian
Smith and two black nationalist leaders, Bishop
Muzorewa and Sithole. There would be a blackprime minister and a black parliamentary major-ity, with the white minority retaining a veto. Ten
years earlier this solution might have been sufﬁ-
cient. Now it was too late. The Patriotic Front of1SOUTHERN AFRICA757
Mugabe and Nkomo rejected the settlement.Nevertheless, there were elections and Muzorewawon them. Smith hoped he had split the African
opposition and won over the majority of blacks
who were longing for peace. But the guerrilla war
waged by the loosely aligned Patriotic Front onlyintensiﬁed.In an effort to contain the guerrillas, who nownumbered several thousand, the Smith–Muzorewa
regime herded villagers into so-called ‘protected
villages’ which, in fact, were usually unsanitary
compounds with totally inadequate facilities. TheRhodesian armed forces, meanwhile, attacked theguerrilla base camps across the borders in Zambia
and Mozambique, killing combatants, women and
children indiscriminately. Unexpectedly, the ﬁght-

ing was nearly over.Under Margaret Thatcher’s new Conservativegovernment the transfer of power to black major-
ity rule was ﬁnally arranged at a conference called
at Lancaster House and presided over by Lord
Carrington, the foreign secretary. Starting inSeptember the Lancaster House Conference didnot end until just before Christmas 1979.
Carrington, Commonwealth leaders and the 
president of Mozambique played a positive role
in bringing all the African leaders, Muzorewa,
Mugabe and Nkomo, together. Mugabe was themost reluctant to accept compromise, especiallythe stipulation that one-ﬁfth of the seats of the
parliament of the independent state should be
reserved for whites. The armed conﬂict continued
even while the negotiations were taking placearound the conference table. A ceaseﬁre, it wasagreed, would come into force only after a settle-
ment had been reached in London. Then elec-
tions would be held in Rhodesia-Zimbabwe.
Meanwhile, an interim government would func-
tion under a British governor until an electedgovernment could be installed in Salisbury.Almost to the end Mugabe refused his consent,
but on 21 December agreement was reached and
a week later a ceasefire came into force. The
settlement guaranteed the whites twenty seats ina multi-party parliament and gave undertakingsthat their property could not be expropriated
without full compensation and that the constitu-
tion could not be changed without a two-thirdsmajority in parliament which would give theunitedwhite MPs a veto.The transition in January and February of1980 was truly remarkable. Britain and the
Commonwealth played a crucial supervisory and
policing role: 122,000 guerrillas assembled insome eighteen areas and were reassured by thepresence of the Commonwealth Observer Group.
The election, too, was hazardous. Supervised by
British observers and 500 British policemen, the
election was held in February 1980 amid recrim-
inations and accusations of intimidation. Theoutcome gave an overwhelming majority not toBishop Muzorewa but to Robert Mugabe and the
ZANU wing of the Patriotic Front. Nkomo’s
ZAPU, which had borne far less of the ﬁghting,
lost out to Mugabe. Muzorewa, who had sharedpower with Smith, was humiliatingly defeated.The independence of Rhodesia-Zimbabwe, now
renamed simply Zimbabwe, was internationally
recognised in April 1980.After all the bloodshed and conﬂict, and facedwith what at the time seemed to be insuperabledifﬁculties, the transfer to black majority rule and
a reasonably stable state was a remarkable event
in modern history.The dominant personality of Zimbabwe’s earlyyears of independence was Robert Mugabe. Hedeserved much credit. His leadership during thisperiod turned out very differently to what might
have been expected after he returned to Rhodesia
in January 1980 to participate in the election,
after sixteen years spent in detention or exile. Thewhite settlers had good grounds to fear thecoming to power of this most uncompromising
of the guerrilla nationalist leaders. Mugabe had
made his admiration for Marxism clear during the
struggle against the settlers, whom he had con-
demned as ‘white exploiters’. Ian Smith, inMugabe’s view, was no more than a criminal whodeserved to be shot.The results of the election and Mugabe’s suc-cess were announced on 4 March 1980. They
came as a shock to the settlers. But Mugabe’s ﬁrstaddress on television that evening was almost asmuch of a surprise. He was conciliatory, called for
reconciliation and unity, and promised to uphold
the law and private property. Deeds followed758AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
words, when the white general Peter Walls, incharge of Rhodesia’s security forces, was con-
ﬁrmed as the commander of the country’s new
army, into which would be integrated the guerrilla
ﬁghters. Ministers were appointed to Mugabe’s
government who supported Nkomo; white minis-ters were also appointed. Ian Smith was able tolead a white-settler party in parliament and to
enjoy freedom and comfort. There was no retri-
bution. Mugabe did not abandon his vision of a
socialist, one-party state, but he was not going to
drive out the white settlers and businessmen onwhom the country’s economy depended or riskplunging the country into new conﬂict.Mugabe’s leadership of Zimbabwe was states-manlike at the outset. From the ﬁrst, the chief
political problem of the new state was the oldrivalry of Nkomo’s ZAPU, with its tribal baseamong the Ndebele in Matabeleland, and
Mugabe’s ZANU, whose members were Shona.
The Shona bitterly resented the lack of military
support received from Nkomo’s ZAPU duringthe ﬁght for freedom. The Patriotic Front hadnever been more than a marriage of convenience.
Nkomo, the cautious, weaker and vacillating
older man, lost the contest to the younger
Mugabe, who had clear goals: progress towards a
one-party state and the abolition of the separate(and ‘racist’) reserved white seats in parliament.Mugabe bullied and cajoled Nkomo. Unrest in
Matabeleland was suppressed in the mid-1980s by
harsh repression. It was the ﬁrst indication how
ruthless Mugabe could be, regardless of the inter-ests of his country if he felt his hold on powerbeing threatened. For a time rivalry with Nkomo
who assumed a subservient role was patched up.
The Mugabe government continued to arrest 
and detain opponents without trial under the
Emergency Powers legislation ﬁrst introduced byIan Smith. Mugabe came close to achieving twoof his aims. With the necessary two-thirds major-
ity assured, which included support from white
settlers, the reserved white seats were abolished
and Nkomo agreed to a union of ZANU withZAPU, ending the rivalry of the previous twentyyears. Nkomo entered the government as vice-
president. But events in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe led Mugabe in 1990 to abandonthe progression to a one-party state. He also jet-tisoned some economic planks of Marxism. Oncemore cool pragmatism and the need for Western
aid won over ideological commitment.The economy was from the start the Achillesheel of Mugabe’s regime. While denouncingSouth Africa’s apartheid racism, Zimbabwe wasnevertheless dependent on its neighbour for
much of its imports and exports. The principal
exports, which did reasonably well during the
decade, were tobacco and cotton. Agriculture was
dependent on the vagaries of the weather andZimbabwe suffered from some long droughts. Itwas also dependent on world prices, and the rise
in the cost of oil had a bad effect here as else-

where. The mining sector did less well, and state
planning and high taxation impeded economicgrowth. A number of ﬁnancial scandals implicatedMugabe’s ministers, and there was some ﬁnancial
mismanagement. The bureaucracy was also inef-
ﬁcient. Mugabe’s political skills did not extend to
the handling of the economy.But this did not affect the judgement of theelectorate that he remained indispensable as pres-
ident. In 1990 the ZAPU–ZANU party won a
landslide victory and Mugabe was overwhelm-

ingly endorsed as president. He could feel secure,
ended the 25-year-old state of emergency andunderlined his non-racist approach by appointinga white lawyer to the position of chief justice.After 1990 Zimbabwe tried to follow themarket prescription of Western institutions,
causing severe economic difﬁculties in the shortterm. The drought in 1992 had a disastrouseffect, with over a million people in the country-
side having to rely on aid for survival until the
rains allowed a new harvest to be brought in.
However, the government for a time was able to
cope better than elsewhere in Central Africa.Ageing authoritarian leaders begin to worrymore about their grip on power than their place 
in history. The transformation of 80-year-old
Mugabe was startling in the later 1990s. A ruthless
streak was always there, but in the early years of hispresidency he displayed pragmatism in his dealingswith the white farmers and businessmen who were
the backbone of Zimbabwe’s economy. Mugabe
altered the constitution of 1979 gradually grasping1SOUTHERN AFRICA759
more power in his hands. But vestiges of represen-
tative democratic government had survived as wellas an independent judiciary and powerful trade
unions. Mugabe was able to dominate parliament
by winning every election since independence;
Zimbabwe was never transformed into a one-partydictatorship. The economy declined, however, catastrophically from droughts and misrule.
Parliamentary elections in July 2000 were a shock
– half the population voted for an opposition 
block under the umbrella of the Movement for
Democratic Change formed in September 1999and backed by the trade unions. Mugabe ralliedsupport by turning the grievance and land hunger
of the majority of the people against 4,000 white
farmers who owned more than two-thirds of the
best land, leaving the black population crowded onsmall plots and working for the white owners.Illegal occupations by organised gangs, violence
and threats drove out the farmers; their workers
lost their livelihoods and Mugabe’s cronies were
rewarded with vacated farms they did not knowhow to cultivate. In place of an orderly gradualtransfer that was to be assisted with promised
British funds, the conﬁscations gathered pace. The

consequence was the shattering of the economy,
the farms not producing enough food for the
people. Wheat production was reduced to ten percent in 2003 of what was harvested in 1999 beforethe occupations began, tobacco growth is down by
two-thirds, only 400 white farmers are still on their
land where there were once 4,000, and many
remaining white farmers are fleeing leaving300,000 black workers in destitution. Mugabe’spolicies have ruined the country. As living stan-

dards bottomed, Mugabe became even more ruth-

less and dictatorial trying to deﬂect the anger of

the people against the whites and the old British
colonial power: 2002 was the year of the presiden-
tial elections.The Movement for Democratic Change choseMorgan Tsangirai to run against Mugabe.
Mugabe would have been ousted but for his
control of the army and police. Opposition sup-porters and their candidates were beaten andseverely injured, white farmers who had dared to
stay on their farms became the renewed targets of
violence; the police did nothing to protect themand most, unfortunately, were murdered. Theresults of the election were shamelessly manipu-lated to rob Tsangirai of the presidency. In 2003
Tsangirai was put on trial on the charge of plot-
ting to kill Mugabe. The Commonwealth sus-
pended Zimbabwe, the European Communitycondemned Mugabe. Financial sanctions andharsh words did not deﬂect him. No country

wanted to intervene effectively and if they had so
willed Mugabe was protected by Mbeki, the 
president of South Africa, who abhorred the
notion that Britain and other ‘white’ nationsshould dictate the future of ‘black’ Zimbabwe anddid not want Tsangirai to become president. As
the country plunges deeper into misery, Mugabe
ensures his hold by rewarding the army and a
close corrupt elite. Of inﬁrmity there is little sign.In Parliamentary elections in 2005 he increasedhis hold. The world was not prepared to stop the
abuses.Dr Hastings Banda became president of Zim-babwe’s neighbour Malawi when independencewas granted to Nyasaland in 1964. In appearance
there was nothing traditionally African about Dr
Banda, who dressed in neat three-piece dark suits
and a Homburg hat. A local touch, however,
were the mbumbass, dancing girls in colourfuldress who surrounded and accompanied him onpublic appearances, singing his praises. Dr Banda
had practised as a doctor in Britain and was
a pillar of the Church of Scotland. The struggle
to force the break-up of the Central AfricanFederation, which bound Nyasaland to Southernand Northern Rhodesia, propelled him to power.
He mobilised opinion against the Federation, 
was imprisoned for a time, headed the Malawi
Congress Party and became prime minister in
1963. The British government was persuaded byBanda’s arguments to dissolve the Federation andto allow Nyasaland independence and separate
nationhood the following year.On gaining independence, Dr Banda oustedrival political leaders, turned Malawi into a repub-lic and became its ﬁrst president. After the earlyturbulent years, he was soon able to consolidate
his position in the state. His ofﬁcial birth date is
given as ‘about 1906’; he was thought, in fact, to760AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
be as old as the century, his grip on power likelyto be relinquished only on death. Malawi’s repu-tation for stability over a quarter of a century
rested on his longevity and hold on the ‘life-
presidency’.Banda’s Malawi was much admired by theWest. He cultivated a close political and economicrelationship with Britain. With black African
leaders he frequently quarrelled, especially with
Zambia and Tanzania. He condemned criticism
of South Africa as ‘hypocritical and dishonest’,
urging greater realism, and he pursued no policies of retribution against white settlers in Malawi. They continued to live a privileged
lifestyle, undisturbed. White farmers and white
civil servants had nothing to fear. His admirable
tolerance did not extend to the black opposition.Strict censorship and the security services sup-pressed dissent. He kept Malawi out of involve-
ment in the black independence struggle of
neighbouring Southern Rhodesia in the 1970s.
Nor did Banda attempt to stop the South African-supported resistance to the Marxist governmentin Mozambique from launching incursions into
Mozambique from Malawi bases on the border.
His policies were regarded by black Africa as a
betrayal, but his main concern was to keep
Malawi free from the bloody struggles and civilwars of Africa. His greatest achievement wasundoubtedly the maintenance of peace in his
country. Remarkable too was Malawi’s humani-
tarian response to the civil war in Mozambique.
By 1991, 1 million refugees had crossed intoMalawi and had been accepted and looked afterby this small and poor country, a response more
civilised than that witnessed in the early 1990s in
some countries of Western Europe.Malawi’s domestic peace, however, was a peacebased on repression. By the 1990s, ﬁred by exam-ples of the overthrow of dictatorship elsewhere inthe world, an internal opposition had grown ever
more determined to be granted a voice and to
criticise Banda. The disastrous state of the
economy added fuel to discontent. Long one-party and one-man rule bred corruption, whilestate-run enterprises were inefﬁcient and uncom-
petitive. Malawi’s exports of tea, coffee and
tobacco and its imports were badly disrupted bythe civil war in Mozambique, which practicallyclosed the railway line to the port of Beira.Bowing to international and internal pressure,
Banda conceded a referendum in 1993 which
voted in favour of multi-party rule. Malawi has
some good farming land, but mismanagement hasled to widespread malnutrition.In 1994 there followed the ﬁrst multi-partyelection. The ruling United Democratic Front
elected President Babili Mulsezi. Malawi enjoyed
relative stability and adopted IMF policies to
secure aid. Mulsezi won a second term but whenin the new millennium his party proposed tochange the constitution to allow him a third term
of office if elected in 2004 there was strong
protest. Democracy, if imperfect, was taking root
in even one of the poorest African countries witha population in 2000 of 12 million and one ofthe lowest incomes per head in Purchasing Power
Parity (US$) of just 600.The contrast between Malawi and Zimbabwe’snorthern neighbour, Zambia, is a stark one.Zambia was dominated for twenty-seven years
after independence in 1964 by the nation’s
founding father, Kenneth Kaunda, until he was
voted out of ofﬁce. Until Kaunda’s departure,
Zambia was virtually a one-party state but of arather unusual kind: Kaunda, who espoused hisown ideology of ‘humanism’, did not resort to
repression or the imprisonment of opponents,
and no politician had to ﬂee into exile. His own
personal inﬂuence overcame the serious tribal andregional conﬂicts during the early years of inde-pendence. On the issue of the black struggles for
equal rights he took a principled stand in support.
The African National Congress found shelter and
assistance in Zambia, though it was periodically
attacked by incursions of special forces fromSouth Africa.The economy suffered badly, virtually ahostage to South Africa, through which most of
Zambia’s exports and imports have to pass.
Zambia relies on copper for 90 per cent of itsexport earnings, and the metal’s price plummetedfor much of the 1980s. Under the guidance of
the International Monetary Fund and assisted by
aid, reform was attempted, especially in the ﬁeld1SOUTHERN AFRICA761
of agricultural production, whose low pricesneeded to be raised. This, in turn, led to riots inthe Copperbelt, where production and real
income were falling while basic foods were
costing more. Lack of investment in modern
mining equipment and exhaustion began to showup in the copper mines. When the price of copperdid rise, production could not be expanded.
Although Kaunda had broken off relations with
the International Monetary Fund in 1988, he
could not halt the continuing depression, even in
the short term. Unrest and opposition, strikes anddisruption in the Copperbelt, undermined hispopularity. Unemployment escalated and stan-

dards of living fell rapidly. The mismanaged one-
party political system was doomed.In October 1991 Kaunda accepted the de-mand for multi-party elections. His UnitedNational Independence Party was defeated by the
newly formed Multi-Party Democracy, whose
leader, Frederick Chiluba, was duly installed as
Zambia’s second president. Kaunda bowed to thedemocratic will and retired.Chiluba dominated the 1990s, his party controlling the legislature. In December 2001,
however, it appeared the majority of the electo-
rate were looking for change. The results when
announced gave a narrow win to the ruling partyand its candidate Mwanawasa who despite allega-tions of electoral fraud was sworn in as president
in January 2002. Zambia’s population growth was
rapid and by the new millennium had increased to
10.4 million; the people too remained sunk inpoverty with a standard of living only little abovethat of Malawi.The demise of white power in Rhodesia couldhave been interpreted at the time as sealing the
fate of white rule in southern Africa. Indeed, onlyten years after the collapse of white rule inRhodesia, the white South African government
began negotiations which, it hoped, would lead
to a power-sharing constitution. The African
National Congress, the major but not the onlyblack participant in the negotiations, demandedmajority rule. The gap between these two posi-
tions was a wide one, but that there should be
negotiations at all in the 1990s in South Africahad been unthinkable only a few years ago. Thereare some parallels with Rhodesia. The applicationof international sanctions, the isolation of South
Africa and the increasingly severe economic pres-
sure as the ﬂow of foreign investment was reversed
ﬁnally convinced the government and the major-ity of white South Africans that a solution had tobe found to the white–black conﬂict. The white
population was able to hold out longer.The white population of South Africa forms amuch larger minority than that in Rhodesia. They
are not a few hundred thousand whites amongmillions of black people, but 4 million. Nor areSouth Africa’s whites comparatively recent immi-
grants; the great majority are South African-born,
and their families have lived in Africa for genera-
tions. The Afrikaners can look to historical rootsas far back as the seventeenth century, when theirancestors settled on the Cape only some seventy
years after the first establishment of English
colonies in North America. Their motherland is
no longer in Europe but in Africa. But unlike thesettlers in North America they did not grow anddevelop to outnumber by many times the indi-
genous peoples. Despite substantial English
immigration they remained a minority.Yet the minority of whites in 1993 still claimedrights to most of the available land and, throughownership of the gold and diamond mines andindustry, dominate South Africa’s economy. The
earnings from mining exports allowed South
Africa to take off on a rapid industrial revolution
from the 1940s onwards on a Western model.Industrial manufacture increased several timesover, making South Africa self-sufﬁcient in many
manufactures and bringing to the white popula-
tion a prosperity comparable to that enjoyed 
by Western nations. Although the black and
coloured peoples earned only a fraction of whiteincomes, they also shared in the growing pros-perity. As the South African government never
tired of pointing out, the country’s black citizens
had incomes comparable to the highest of any
black person in Africa.This economic transformation had importantsocial and international repercussions. Afrikaners
were no longer poor farmers, and the division
between them and the ‘English’ lessened. Black,762AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
coloured and Asian people were needed both inskilled labour, in trade and in the professions,
because there were not enough whites to run amodern industrial country and serve its economicneeds. The better-educated and better-organised
of the non-whites, with higher aspirations, were
able to compare their quality of life with that of
the whites, a comparison that created bitternessand conﬂict. It made their exclusion from tradeunion and political rights increasingly impossible
to justify. Internationally, too, a modern economy
interacts with the world economy, making it
impossible for a state to ignore world opinion orthe economic pressures exerted by sanctions.More important even than sanctions was the
judgement of foreign businessmen that a polit-
ically unstable South Africa, possibly heading
towards revolution and bloodshed, was not a
good country to invest in.Nevertheless, the white South African govern-ment was able to hold up progress towards equal
black political rights for so long thanks to its own
armed strength, economic power and independ-
ent status. Unlike in Rhodesia, Britain hadretained no reserve sovereign powers. At the turnof the century (1899–1902), it had fought the
two Boer Republics, the Orange Free State and
the Transvaal, to afﬁrm imperial paramountcy; it
was a war of supremacy between whites. To the
Liberals in Britain the Boers had been wrongedand they wished to make amends when they cameto power. The Union of South Africa was formed
in 1910, granting the whites independence as a
Dominion within the British Empire. But bitter
memories of the camps into which Boer familieshad been forced during the war, many dying fromdisease, continued to affect relations between the
more nationalist Afrikaners and the English untilthe middle of the century. As for the blackAfricans, the Boer War did not help them. Their
enfranchisement was dependent on the whitemajority. Deprived of adequate land, Zulusrebelled in 1906, only to be bloodily suppressed.
Protest and the expression of independent black
opinion found a focus, just as in the southern
states of America, in black churches. They haveplayed an important role during the twentiethcentury, and as religious institutions enjoy some
protection. The Asian, mainly Indian, commu-
nity, meanwhile, had found a brilliant spokesman
and organiser in a young lawyer, M. K. Gandhi.When in 1910 the existing self-governingcolonies, the Cape, Natal, the Orange Free State
and the Transvaal, formed the Union of South
Africa, they did not federate, but became provinces
of a central union. No non-whites could be elected
to parliament, and the franchise was left as it hadbeen before the Union; this allowed some voice tothe coloured and black population in the Cape, but
none elsewhere. In London, a black and coloured
delegation, which had raised objections to the
political colour-bar, was listened to with sympathy,but the constitution of the Union was seen as aquestion to be decided by South African whites.
There were some prominent white South African
politicians who opposed the colour-bar in politics;
indeed, throughout twentieth-century South
African history there have been a number of dis-
tinguished whites, from Walter Stanford early inthe century to Mrs Helen Suzman in our own
time, who have spoken for the rights of the other
races in parliament, but they have been a small
minority. The only safeguards London had pro-
vided for black people when the Union was formedwas to retain British protectorates over Basutoland,
Bechuanaland and Swaziland, which were to1SOUTHERN AFRICA763

continue unless their black inhabitants consentedto incorporation in the Union. This the popula-
tions did not want and Britain rejected South
African attempts to incorporate them. They even-

tually became independent – Basutoland as
Lesotho and Bechuanaland as Botswana in 1966,and Swaziland in 1968 – though all three countriesare nevertheless wholly dependent on the South
African economy. The limited voting rights (they
entitled black people to white representation only)
which black and coloured people enjoyed in the
Cape province, as conﬁrmed by the Act of Union,
were abolished for black Africans in 1936 and forthe coloured citizens, in practice, in 1955.Whatever differences existed between thewhite political parties in other matters, in their
attitudes to non-whites they were broadly similar.They abhorred intermarriage between the races;they were determined to maintain white domina-
tion and government; the black African was to be
denied equal political and economic rights; his
role was to serve the white state.The policy followed was called ‘segregation’, aforerunner of apartheid. Early in the history of the
Union, legislation was enacted which made it clear
that the path of South African development would
not be towards common goals for all its peoples
without regard to colour. The 1913 Native LandAct made it illegal for black people to buy or leaseland outside the overcrowded designated African
reserve areas. In the greater part of South Africa
they were thus deprived of a fundamental right of
all citizens of a country, ownership of land. TheAct was not rigidly applied, except in the OrangeFree State, but the principle of such discrimination
was here clearly enshrined in law. The Native
Urban Area Act ten years later segregated the
black from the white population in towns. It had
been prompted by the unsanitary conditions ofblack housing and the fear that disease wouldspread to whites. But, in laying down the govern-
ment’s right not only to segregate but to control
the numbers of black people allowed to live in
towns, it formed the basis, together with the LandActs of 1913 and 1936, of the whole post-1948apartheid structure.The year 1948 marked a turning point inAfrican politics. Before the Second World War,from 1933 to 1939, the radical and the more mod-
erate wings of Afrikaner politics had come togetherto create the United Party, which formed a 
government. The prime minister was General
Hertzog, and the statesman General Jan Smuts 
was a deputy prime minister. Not all Afrikanersaccepted the fusion. A small group led by F. Malanformed a ‘puriﬁed’ National Party in 1934, to
which the racist ideology of Hitler’s National
Socialism particularly appealed. Afrikaner national-

ism was strengthened by the Second World War.
Hertzog split the United Party in 1939, because hewanted to opt for neutrality, while Jan Smuts nar-
rowly carried parliament into entering the war with
the other Commonwealth countries. The war itself
obscured the strength of Afrikaner nationalism.
Some extreme pro-German Afrikaners wereinterned, but the majority of South Africans,Afrikaner and English, fought against the Nazis.
Smuts seemed completely dominant. Yet Malan,
with considerable skill, nurtured a small reuniﬁed

National Party. Once the war was over, the unam-
biguous race policy of the Afrikaner National Party– the policy of apartheid – confronted the liberalis-

ing sentiments of Smuts’s United Party and gave
the Malan party a bare majority in the 1948 elec-

tion, despite Smuts’s enormous prestige. Smuts
died in 1950 and the United Party fell into adecline. The Nationalist Party’s majority increasedwith every election until the 1980s. After 1948,
the political, social and economic development of
South Africa was (until 1990) based on apartheid,
which had the support of a large majority of thewhite population but was opposed with increasingvehemence by black people.For sixteen years Dr Henrik Verwoerd was thearchitect of the apartheid structure, ﬁrst as minis-
ter of native affairs from 1950 to 1958 and then
as prime minister until 1966. He elaborated andadjusted to modern conditions the laws under-pinning the maintenance of white supremacy in a
society that was segregated with increasing strict-
ness. He, in turn, after his assassination by a
crazed white, was succeeded by B. J. Vorster, whoremained prime minister until 1978. Proponentsof apartheid even claimed that the system was
supported by the law of God, according to the
teachings of the Dutch Reformed Church. Each764AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
race should be kept pure and allowed to developits own national existence. But the assumptionbehind all this was that the different races were
not of equal worth. The White Afrikaner
belonged to a Herrenvolk. What made apartheidso offensive and unacceptable to world opinionwere the lessons learnt from the actions of thatother prophet of a master race, Adolf Hitler. His
master race had murdered and enslaved millions
belonging to ‘inferior’ races. It would not be
accurate to claim exact parallels between the poli-
cies followed by the governments of South Africaand Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, after the eventsof the Second World War no ideology of unequal
races could win respect. UN membership is com-
posed largely of non-white nations, as is the
British Commonwealth. Paradoxically, by insist-ing on separate black and white development,apartheid stimulated black nationalism and
encouraged the development of a separate black
power base. When in 1990 the white political
leadership recognised this danger and opened theNational Party to black membership, it was toolate to undo the harm done by the decades of
racially divided political power.The doctrine of apartheid went far beyondpolitical segregation, of course. Blood laws very
similar to the notorious Nazi Nürnberglaws of
1935 were passed in 1949 and 1950, forbiddingmixed marriages and sexual relations (outside
already existing marriages) between whites 
and non-whites. In parallel, the Population
Registration Act of 1949 classiﬁed each individual
into his or her racial group – white, black, colouredor Asian. The Nazis, to distinguish Jews from
Aryans, focused on the religion of the four grand-

parents. But since the black Africans were as
Christian as the whites, the South African
Nationalist Party could make judgements onlyaccording to appearance: the curl of the hair, thecolour of the skin. Some ‘doubtful’ cases slipped
into a ‘better’ category, and every year there were
appeals for ‘regradings’. One reason for this cate-

gorisation in 1949 was that such ‘slippage’ couldbe controlled once everyone had been duly classi-
ﬁed according to race. The pass laws were also
tightened in 1952. Every non-white was obliged to
carry a pass indicating his or her race and where heor she was authorised to work and live. Blackpeople were not allowed to live in white townsunless born there or unless they had worked there
for a number of years already. Illegal squatters in
town and country could be forcibly removed. In
1953 the Bantu Education Act separated blackeducation and prescribed a schooling suitable forthe lowly positions black citizens could occupy in
South African society. Many of the segregationist
laws also applied to Indians and coloured people.
To enforce all the apartheid laws, large and small,
the government needed to control the populationand crush opposition. By the Suppression ofCommunism Act 1950, the government virtually
turned South Africa into a police state. The label
‘communism’ could be stretched almost inﬁnitely

to encompass opposition to government policies.For instance, it enabled the government to moveagainst multiracial trade unions even before they
were banned in 1957.Black, coloured and Asian people had beenorganising themselves into protest movementssince early in the twentieth century. In 1912 theAfrican National Congress (or ANC – so named
in 1923) was founded by Pixly Ka Izaka Seme, a
Zulu lawyer educated at Columbia and Oxford
Universities and the Middle Temple. His voice
was one of moderation and reason, not seekingconfrontation but confident that the franchisewould be extended to the relatively small number
of ‘civilised’ black Africans. It was not. During the
depression between the wars the ANC backed
black strikes and launched protest movementsagainst the pass laws. But the government was toostrong and was able to emasculate the ANC by
mass arrests. There were also congresses of unity
between the non-white organisations; tragically
there has also been much tension and conﬂict
between black people and Indians. In 1942, asection of the ANC – the Youth League –adopted a more militant outlook. In the early
1950s, Indians and black people once more coop-
erated in deﬁance of the unjust laws. But the gov-
ernment always had the political strength to putdown strikes and mass protests by using force andarresting and trying thousands. This simply
increased militancy. While the ANC continued to
cooperate with Indians and communists and1SOUTHERN AFRICA765
socialist whites, a split occurred in 1958 and arival black organisation was founded, the Pan-Africanist Congress, which objected to such links.Early in 1960 both the ANC and the PAClaunched a mass campaign against the pass laws.
On 21 March 1960, in the small town ofSharpeville, whose name was to reverberatearound the world, a large crowd assembled
outside the police station. Although the people
were not violent, the police panicked and opened
ﬁre, killing sixty-nine black people and injuring
another 180. In most, though not all, towns blackdemonstrations were dispersed without deaths.Pictures of what became known as the Sharpeville
massacre were ﬂashed around South Africa and
out to a shocked world. Black people began to
stay at home, away from work. The governmentcame down as usual with great severity anddeclared the ANC and PAC illegal organisations.
Thousands were detained and later sentenced to
prison. Prime Minister Verwoerd also declared a
state of emergency. Not long after, a mentally dis-turbed white man shot the prime minister in thehead, badly injuring him and heightening the
crisis atmosphere.That autumn white voters approved a proposalto turn South Africa into a republic, thus cuttingthe last link with Britain. In 1961, South Africa
left the Commonwealth, anticipating the refusal
of the Commonwealth prime ministers to allow it
to remain a member.In the aftermath of Sharpeville, the blackprotest movement formed a new National Action
Council to work non-violently against apartheid,
and in 1961 it chose a young black lawyer named
Nelson Mandela as its leader. A strike was called.
More was needed than peaceful protests to per-suade white South Africa to grant rights to theblack Africans. Mandela went underground and
organised an active militant wing of the ANC –
the Spear of the Nation. Its intention was to sab-
otage installations without causing injury topeople. Meanwhile, the banned ANC establishedits headquarters outside South Africa in Zambia.
Mandela was caught in August 1962 and in 1964
was sentenced to life imprisonment with other
militant ANC leaders. His political trial earnedhim worldwide admiration. The South Africanauthorities attempted to smear him as a commu-
nist working for Russia. That became the line766AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
The world is shocked when confronted with the realities of apartheid. South Africa, 21 March 1960, Sharpeville.© Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbisadopted to condemn all black efforts to defeatinjustice. Yet Mandela’s words at his trial hadexpressed a different ideal; he spoke of a:democratic and free society in which allpersons live together in harmony and withequal opportunities ... It is an ideal which I
hope to live for and to achieve, but if need be,
an ideal for which I am prepared to die.Mandela became an inspiration for black Africans,though he was completely shut off from them fortwenty-eight years, twenty of them in the harshconditions of Robben Island.The white leaders of the independent SouthAfrican Republic from 1960 onwards tried to
promote a more positive image of their policies.‘Apartheid’ was dropped in favour of what wascalled ‘separate development’. The new policy
was to develop the black reserves into ‘home-
lands’ and eventually into ‘independent’ black
nations, which of course would remain totallydependent for their livelihood on South Africa.Then the whites would be able to claim that they
were ‘democratic’ and no longer denying black
people political rights, for these they would enjoy
in their own nations. The homelands, or bantus-
tans, were fragmented regions of land quite inca-pable of accommodating or sustaining themajority of the South African black population.
Yet, by making every black a citizen of a bantus-
tan whether he lived there or in the Republic, the
black majority in the Republic would be turnedinto migrants who were not entitled to politicalrights there. In the 1960s and 1970s this policy
was pushed vigorously ahead. Self-government
and later ‘independence’ were bestowed on
Transkei in 1976, on Bophutatswana in 1977, on
Venda in 1979 and on Ciskei in 1981. The inter-national community has refused to recognise theirindependence. Six other states have been granted
self-government but not independence. The most
important was KwaZulu; its chief minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi wished to maintainregional autonomy in a South Africa with major-ity black rule. He has worked within the law to
assert black rights. He rejected the socialist ide-
ology of the ANC and is determined to maintainZulu separateness in increasingly bitter struggleswith the ANC.Some attempt was made in the 1960s and1970s to improve conditions in the homelands
by increasing government spending. Although
there is a certain amount of industry and tradeto provide a livelihood for the black Africans, mostof them must ﬁnd employment in the Republic,
either as immigrant workers from the bantustans
or as permitted residents in townships. The
migrant worker is often separated from his family
for long periods but the earnings he remits homeconstituted in the mid-1980s nearly half theincome of the so-called black nations. Continuous
repression by the police has seen the forcible
removal of some 3.5 million black people to their
bantustans.Bantustans and the banning of the ANC didnot solve South Africa’s problem, even though
police repression and the military power of white
Africa made a black seizure of power impossible.
Black leaders continued to organise movementsagainst the whole system. One of these, a non-white student movement led by Steve Biko, had
much success, advocating black consciousness and
non-cooperation with whites. Biko was arrested
by police in 1977 and his death in custody, after
brutal police interrogation, further damaged theRepublic’s reputation. From their exile, the frag-mented black militant opposition, the ANC and
the PAC, were able to perform some acts of sab-
otage; as guerrillas they were ineffective, but they
kept the whole question of black political andeconomic rights on the agenda of South Africanpolitics.Unrest which broke out among black peoplein the overcrowded townships, such as Soweto
outside Johannesburg, owed less to black political
organisation than to black resentments. Like therest of the world, the South African economy suffered from the recession of the mid-1970s.
Recession always hits the black population hardest
and in 1973 there were massive black strikes.
After Sharpeville, Soweto came to stand for theworst aspects of white repression. In 1976, inSoweto, schoolchildren began demonstrating
against being forced to use Afrikaans as the
medium of instruction. On 16 June, 15,000 black1SOUTHERN AFRICA767
schoolchildren and youths gathered together.The police ﬁred on them to disperse them, killingtwenty-ﬁve and wounding many more. A wave of
black protest swept the country. It was crushed,
but not eliminated – only driven underground.
The black Africans could not be paciﬁed, howevermany thousands were imprisoned.The 1980s were dominated by the imperiousPresident P. W. Botha, who became more author-
itarian as he grew older and earned the less than
ﬂattering epithet, Die Groot Krokodil. The doc-trine of a purist apartheid was being discarded bythe majority of the white population as impracti-cal and unenforceable in a South Africa that
required millions of black people to work with
whites in the modern economy. Even Botha, on
becoming president in 1979, had accepted thatthe whites would have to adapt.During the Botha years of the 1980s, a policyof relaxing some of the aspects of apartheid went
hand in hand with military and police repression
against black political organisations in forcefuldisplays of white supremacy. Police beat demon-strators with sticks and whips, and occasionally
shot them. The years 1985 and 1986 were ﬁlled
with protests, violence and thousands of arrests.
Botha introduced a state of emergency. Violence
in the black townships could not be controlled byany responsible black political organisations,because the security services had ensured that
they could not operate coherently inside the
Republic with most of their leaders in prison and
some 20,000 black people, many of them chil-dren, detained for months in 1987. Protestorganisations were fragmented and black people
also killed black people, accusing them of collab-
orating or just because they belonged to a differ-
ent group. When law and order break down,
genuine protest and the struggle for freedombecome inextricably mixed up with arson, crimeand gang warfare. This allowed the government
to claim that the black movement was both crim-
inal and communist.As Botha carried through a ruthless policy ofrepression, he also began to amend some of the200-odd apartheid laws and regulations. In 1979,
black Africans were allowed for the ﬁrst time to
join official trade unions; the entry of blackpeople into towns and their right to take up newjobs were made easier by the abolition of the passbooks in 1986. But these moves did not touch
the fundamental pillars on which white supremacy
rested, of which the most crucial was political
power. The complex new constitution introducedby Botha in 1984 established separate Asian,coloured and white parliamentary assemblies
while leaving ultimate power in white hands, but
it satisﬁed no one least of all the majority of the
black people, who were not represented at all.
International business unease and some tighten-ing of international sanctions in 1986 alsoincreased pressure. More importantly in the
course of the 1980s the majority of whites came
to recognise that some fundamental changes had
to come, however much they were disliked by themajority.The old white–black relationship, which hadfrequently involved caring bonds between black
nannies and white children or between paternal-
istic employers and their workers, was at best anunequal master–servant tie based on the distinc-tion of race. It was as out of place in modern
South Africa as the master–servant relations
between rich and poor in Victorian England. The
black population was no longer composed of
semi-literate unskilled workers. There was agrowing number, albeit still small, of skilled, pro-fessional and middle-class black people, some of
them driving BMWs. The Anglican archbishop
Desmond Tutu was black. The total exclusion of
black people from the government system becameincreasingly impossible to justify.It was these doubts growing throughout the1980s among a majority of the white community
about apartheid, rather than the opposition from
the small white minority that for many years had
fought for black rights, that cracked a systemwhich could otherwise have been upheld by the military force the whites commanded. The
outside world had helped, but these internal
changes of attitude were more vital. The Dutch
Reformed Church no longer supported apartheidbut condemned it as irreconcilable with Christianethics. White South Africans in the early 1990s
tended to feel apprehensive about a future that
would be very different from the past once the768AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
black majority had gained power, but most wereresigned to it. The task, as they saw it, was tomake the best of it, to entrench some white rights
and to guard the Republic against a black back-
lash and radical socialist experiments.South Africa was at the crossroads. In 1989, itfound in two remarkable men the leadership tohelp guide the country out of its impasse of vio-
lence and bloodshed. In September 1989 F. W.
de Klerk was inaugurated as president in succes-
sion to Botha. He had a reputation for caution
and was thought to be in tune with Botha’sapproach of dealing with South Africa’s problemsby a mixture of reform and repression. As educa-
tion minister he had introduced the requirement
of Afrikaans instruction in black schools, which
led to the Soweto outbreak and the schoolboycott in 1976. The Nationalist Party whichelected him could regard him as a safe choice. But
in only a short time de Klerk charted a new course
of reform and serious negotiations with black
leaders. In February 1990 he lifted the bans onthe ANC and on the PAC, prohibited sinceSharpeville in 1960; to general astonishment he
also repealed the even older prohibition on the
South African Communist Party, which was
working with the ANC. President de Klerk’s
partner in the forthcoming negotiations wasNelson Mandela, unconditionally released, to arapturous welcome, on 11 February 1990 after
twenty-seven years in prison. Soon afterwards, in
May, substantive negotiations between Mandela,
the ANC leadership and de Klerk began. Earlyprogress was rapid and in August the ANCannounced that they were suspending the ‘armed
struggle’.Neither de Klerk nor Mandela, of course, hada free hand. In the ﬁrst place Mandela had to
work with the collective leadership of the ANC.Nor could he claim to speak for all black people.Chief Buthelezi, representing mainly Zulus and
his Inkatha movement, had followed a separate
approach to African rights within Africa for many
years. A black leadership power struggle, lookingbeyond the end of white majority rule, led tobloodshed between Inkatha and the ANC.
Buthelezi with 1.5 million followers was not pre-
pared to be pushed aside. The smaller Pan-AfricanCongress was also suspicious of the ANC and itsleft-wing outlook and was less prepared to com-promise with white South Africa, but it could
count only on minority support among black
Africans. The black so-called homelands, with
‘governments’ and administrators of their own,backed up by the administration in Pretoria, hadcreated self-interested groups in favour of main-
taining the status quo. In any settlement they
knew they would vanish. Differences of wealth as
much as tribal differences also divided black inter-
ests. World attention was fixed on Mandela,whose dignified leadership, free from rancouragainst his former white jailers, had earned him
worldwide admiration. In any settlements, other
non-white leaders would also play a part, includ-
ing those of the coloured and the Indian popula-tions. The ANC, the largest African politicalorganisation, however, could claim to speak for
the majority of black Africans.De Klerk’s ﬁrst hurdle was that not only had he to reach a settlement with black leaders but healso had to carry his own National Party and thewhite community with him. Rather more than 
a quarter of former supporters opposed him, rang-
ing from militant white racialists with neo-Nazi
emblems to Afrikaners who claimed they were
ready to trek again to establish a pure Afrikanerrepublic in one of the distant corners of theUnion. The business community was fearful of 
the ANC’s communist alliance. The threat of con-
ﬁscation of white property and of nationalisation
of South Africa’s industries, mines and ﬁnancialinstitutions lessened after 1990 with the collapseof Soviet-style command economies. Even so, a
black majority government would wish to improve
black standards of living and conditions of work as
rapidly as possible. Such an aim suggested an
active, interventionist government, rather thanone following free-market, laissez-faire policies.The upsurge of black violence, thoughdirected against other black people, was also
fuelled by rogue elements in the South African
police and intelligence services; it raised the awfulspectre of a complete breakdown of law andorder. If black aspirations could not be satisﬁed,
would black Africans turn on the better-off
whites? How were white minority rights to be1SOUTHERN AFRICA769
safeguarded against a black majority? The difﬁculttask of reaching political settlement had toaddress these concerns and others. There were
sections of the white population determined to
derail the negotiations. Some sinister elements in
the South African security services and policeexploited the hostility between the ANC andInkatha and themselves fomented violence. In the
past, moreover, Inkatha had received financial
support from government sources. There is white
as well as black violence. The ANC accused de
Klerk of double dealing, of not doing enough tostop the violence. If de Klerk was sincere in hisefforts, and it was difﬁcult to doubt this seriously,
then clearly he had enormous difﬁculty in con-
trolling all that was done in the name of the
government.De Klerk began by dismantling minorapartheid laws which prevented black people
mixing with whites socially on beaches and else-
where. The ANC and PAC were recognised as
political organisations and were no longer deﬁnedas terrorists. Their leaders were released fromprison. Over a period of three years, by the
middle of 1992, the whole legal system of
apartheid was repealed. But the social and eco-
nomic effects of the system did not thereby dis-
appear overnight. Discrimination of more than acentury had left the great majority of blackAfricans in a depressed and severely disadvantaged
position in housing, in training and education, in
the provision of social services, in employment, in
health, in income – in every aspect of life.Violent clashes in the early 1990s betweenInkatha and ANC supporters and in the home-
lands resulted in several thousand deaths and
threatened to undermine further progress towards
a settlement and transitional government. Presi-
dent de Klerk, who was blamed for the violenceby the ANC, succeeded in calling a ‘peace con-ference’ in September 1991, which was attended
by the Inkatha Freedom Party, the ANC and the
National Party. But, despite a ‘national peace
accord’ which set up procedures to contain vio-lence, the bloody clashes continued. Nevertheless,the negotiating sessions, periodically broken off
by the ANC in protest at the violence, had made
solid progress.In December 1991 representatives of nineteenpolitical groups of all races created a Conventionfor a Democratic South Africa, CODESA for
short, which began work on establishing how an
interim government of national unity might be
formed and a parliament or assembly called whosetask it would be to agree a constitution. The gapbetween the ANC’s demand for majority rule and
de Klerk’s desire for a more decentralised state
founded on the power-sharing principle, no
majority being able to override a minority,
remained the major obstacle to a settlement. Ineconomic policy Mandela had reassured whitesthat there was no plan to nationalise everything.
A signiﬁcant step forward was taken in March
1992 when in a nationwide referendum of white
South Africans de Klerk gained a large majorityin favour of his policy of reform and of sharingpower with black people. CODESA was the best
hope of resolving existing differences about how
to create a new constitutional South Africa. To
put more pressure on the government, the ANClaunched ‘mass action’ to end white rule. Theprotest campaign led to more bloodshed, law-
lessness and violence. White South Africa was in
1992 in the throes of recession, with at least a
third of the black population unemployed; the
potential for an ever-escalating violence under-mining the process towards a negotiated peacefulsettlement was great. But the majority of black
Africans had accepted the leadership of Mandela,
who was striving for a just settlement with de
Klerk. They also knew that de Klerk was the onewhite political leader who could deliver it andcarry white South Africa with him.A deal was struck in the spring of 1993. De Klerk abandoned the principle of power
sharing and Mandela agreed to the postponement
of undiluted one man one vote majority rule until1999. A new constitution was drafted meanwhileby a constituent assembly and an interim national
unity government was set up.Nelson Mandela towers over Africa’s otherleaders. The peaceful negotiated transfer of powerfrom whites to the black majority of South Africawas a landmark in the history of the country. The
white population still controlled the military and
the police force, but Mandela and the African770AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
National Congress were able to convince thewhite leadership that they sought not revenge forthe decades of oppression they had suffered but
a new start heralded by compromise and recon-
ciliation. That alone made the transfer of power
possible. Twenty-eight million black Africanswere enfranchised, and in April 1994 waitedpatiently in long lines to vote in the ﬁrst non-
racially divided elections. The ANC emerged as
victors, with 62.6 per cent of the national vote,
and Mandela was installed as president of South
Africa. The worst outbreaks of violence had beennot between white and black Africans butbetween the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party
led by the Zulu Chief Buthelezi. For years the
apartheid governments had encouraged this split
and promoted violence and murder. The hatredspersisted and the conflict claimed more than10,000 lives. But with de Klerk as deputy,
Mandela began the diﬁcult task of charting South
Africa’s future. In May 1996 the National Party
withdrew from the coalition with the ANC aftera new democratic constitution was passed by par-liament. Apartheid was abolished but in otherrespects the changes did not bring immediate
benefits to the African people. The ANC’s
Reconstruction and Development Programme,
with its huge spending plans for housing, educa-tion and agriculture only made slow progress,although free primary health care was introduced
and the economy is expanding slowly, especially
since socialist planning was abandoned. The dis-
appointment experienced by large sections of the
urban poor has produced high crime rates.Apartheid has been dismantled but its legacy con-tinues: economic power remained overwhelm-

ingly in white hands. The small proportion of
highly educated blacks have beneﬁtted, but for
the great majority of the 46 million SouthAfricans life remains as hard as ever. Mandelalived up to his promise to prevent a backlash
against white South Africans. The Truth and
Reconciliation Commission – perhaps the most
remarkable institution to be set up in the course1SOUTHERN AFRICA771
Johannesburg, South Africa. There are no anatomical differences, but the laws of apartheid do not allow whiteand black people to use the same toilets. © Ian Berry/Magnum Photosof the century – began its sessions under thechairmanship of Archbishop Desmond Tutu inApril 1996. Its mission was to exorcise the
hatreds of the apartheid era by granting amnes-
ties for politically motivated crimes, including
murder. The televised sessions showed victimsand torturers confronting each other as thepainful truth was extracted. Policemen admitted
to the killing of Steve Biko in 1977; the covert
activities of secret military organisations who used
assassination and torture to suppress opposition,
were uncovered. Black crimes have also beenbrought to light. The Commission has dischargedthese tasks with fairness and magnanimity.In June 1999 Mandela retired and ThaboMbeki was chosen by the African National
Congress Party to succeed him. Although theANC enjoys two-thirds majority in South Africa’sNational Assembly, Mbeki has not abused the
democratic settlement. Mbeki, while wishing to
create a more equitable society between white and
black Africans has continued the Mandela tradi-tion of reconciliation between the races. SouthAfrica’s prosperity is dependent on the West and
Mbeki has followed a cautious policy in global
politics. On the African continent Mbeki is more
active, however, sending peacekeeping soldiers to
assist the UN. The most problematic aspect is hisopposition to outside intervention in Zimbabwe.So far his diplomacy has not softened Mugabe’s
corrupt misrule. Most controversial has been
Mbeki’s refusal for a long time to acknowledge
the true nature of the AIDS disease which is rav-aging sub-Saharan Africa. More than 4 millionSouth Africans are infected, one in ﬁve of the most
sexually active in the 15- to 25-year-old genera-
tion. The demographic effects are catastrophic
creating orphans and an imbalance between
young workers and the old unless the spread canbe drastically reduced. Mbeki for long denied thecause of AIDS calling it just one of the diseases of
poverty and claiming that drugs could do more
harm than good. He saw it as a white man’s way
of denigrating Africans. Mandela was outragedand waged a public campaign against Mbeki’srefusal until 2003 to accept the facts. Since 2000
more has been done to educate the young and
provide drugs, though not to everyone who needsthem. A national plan has begun to emerge butprogress is painfully slow.As the 1990s began the south-western region ofthe African continent had been the scene of con-
tinuous bloodshed and of international involve-
ment since the 1960s. In Angola the Cold War
and the post-independence conflicts between rival black movements, which had fought thePortuguese before independence in November
1975, inﬂicted devastation on the country. South
Africa became heavily involved in the civil war for
ideological and racial reasons and in order toretain its grip on Namibia. It was a devilish brew.Parts of the interlocking conflicts were finally
resolved when Namibia gained its independence
in 1990 and South Africa withdrew. International
intervention, spearheaded by the United Nations,
had led to a measure of success in the paciﬁcationof this region of Africa.772AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
Nelson Mandela, released from prison after 27 yearson 15 January 1990, leads white and black Africans
to a better future. © Peter Turnley/CorbisIn Angola the three independence movements– the National Liberation Front (FNLA), theNational Union for Independence (UNITA) and
the Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola (MPLA) – started fighting each other
soon after independence was gained in 1975. Itwas a power conﬂict with strong ethnic inﬂuences.The MPLA was a Marxist organisation that tried
to appeal across tribal divisions; the FNLA in the
north-west of Angola drew support from the
Bakongo tribe; while the most formidable resis-
tance against the MPLA was organised fromsouthern Angola by Dr Jonas Savimbi’s UNITA,his support founded on the largest tribe, the
Ovimbundu. The FNLA and Savimbi courted
South Africa and the West for support against
communism. Troops from outside the Africancontinent were sent in 1976 to help the MPLA todefeat UNITA and the FNLA. By arrangement
with Moscow, Cuban troops began to arrive and
at the close of the 1980s were 50,000 strong.
Thus the Cold War was extended to exacerbatethe bloody conﬂict in the region. After continuousﬁghting the Angolans and Cubans were unable to
overcome the South African-backed UNITA;
South Africa’s support for the FNLA and UNITA
was bound up with its occupation of Namibia. But
after 1989 South Africa became increasingly anx-ious to disengage from Angola. In May 1991 apeace accord was ﬁnally signed in Lisbon. The
Portuguese, the United Nations, the Organisation
of African Unity, the US and the Soviet Union
had all acted as mediators. It would take manyyears to rebuild the devastated country if peacecould only be maintained.In September 1992, as part of the peaceaccord, general elections were held, monitored by
the UN. José Eduardo’s Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) won 58 percent of the congressional seats. Savimbi and hissupporters (UNITA) refused to accept the result.
His well-armed guerrillas resumed the civil war.
The Cold War sponsors have withdrawn their sup-
port from the respective warring sides, but neitherthis, nor the destitution of the people and thedestruction of the country, seemed likely to guar-
antee a peaceful compromise. For some 3 million
Ovimbundus UNITA remained their cause andthe MPLA an implacable foe. Peace only becamepossible after the killing of Jonas Savimbi inFebruary 2002 and the defeats UNITA had suf-
fered. In April the difﬁcult transition began assem-
bling UNITA soldiers in camps where they were
supposed to disarm and then return to civilian life.Four million people were displaced from theirhomes; the UN here too is fulﬁlling a thankless
role to help maintain the peace and provide basic
support to stave off famine. There is little work or
future for the majority of families in the shattered
countryside. The one-party state relies on its oilrevenues, but is blighted by corruption and stillhas to make good decades of civil war.Namibia had been the German colony of South-West Africa until the close of the First World War,when it was handed over to South Africa under aLeague of Nations mandate. In 1966 the United
Nations revoked the mandate, and in 1969 the
Security Council again called on South Africa to
withdraw. The Western powers were not preparedto force South Africa out – its gold mines andeconomy, its strategic importance and its anti-
communist stance ensured that its survival was vital
to the West, more vital than Namibia. Britain in
particular was lukewarm about sanctions and about
any other undue pressure, even while condemningapartheid. A resistance movement, the South-WestAfrica People’s Organisation (SWAPO), began
guerrilla operations against South Africa in 1966,
backed by Angola’s MPLA after 1975. South
Africa mounted offensives into southern Angola ina vain effort to destroy SWAPO.The stalemate gradually wore down the will ofthe contestants. The United Nations headed a
peace mission which, in December 1988, reached a
settlement over the future of Namibia. South Africa
agreed to withdraw its troops and to give upNamibia, provided the Cuban troops withdrewfrom Angola. The Cold War had been removed
from the contest. SWAPO won the general election
held under UN supervision in November 1989,
and the SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma formed a gov-
ernment when Namibia gained its independence in1990. Namibia is largely composed of desert but it
has valuable resources of uranium and diamonds.
The SWAPO-led government followed a policy of1SOUTHERN AFRICA773
moderation: members of other parties wereincluded in the administration, and the 70,000whites were not dispossessed. Moreover, South
Africa left behind a good infrastructure, so Namibia
had a promising future if internal peace continued
to prevail. But no solution had been found to theproblem of settling the landless former SWAPOﬁghters who returned to the country from Angola.In 2003 Nujoma became more strident threat-ening to expropriate white South African and
German farmers. But moderation has prevailed;
despite applauding Mugabe, Nujoma has notcopied his tactics.In Portugal’s other former colony, Mozam-bique, there was little prospect for a better future;
until 1990, no major international peacekeep-
ing effort had been made, partly because the Cold War did not impinge with the same inten-sity as it did in Angola, and partly because
Mozambique has no important resources like
Angola’s oil. The Soviet Union and China sent
aid and technical assistance, but no troops fromthe Eastern bloc were introduced. Although thepost-independence government of the victorious
liberation movement, Frelimo, was Marxist, there
was always a tussle between the hardliners and
the pragmatists. The ﬂamboyant ﬁrst president,
Samora Machel, who was killed in an air crash in1986, was succeeded by the more moderateJoaquim Chissano, who enjoyed much Western
sympathy. Mozambique has been subject to 
the depredations of the Mozambique National
Resistance (MNR), set up in 1976 by the Rhode-sian intelligence service. In 1980, the MNRmoved its bases to South Africa. As in Angola,
South African intervention has been racial in 
motivation, to maintain white South African
supremacy and to restrict the activities of the
African National Congress. Although the ANChad no military bases in Mozambique but trainedin Angola and Tanzania, Mozambique was the
transit route used for guerrilla incursions into
South Africa. South Africa retaliated by support-
ing the MNR. In 1984 President Machel tried to win South African support by refusing the ANC transit. But this treaty of ‘non-aggression
and good neighbourliness’ had little impact on
conditions in Mozambique.The civil war raged on, with brutalities andatrocities perpetrated against the civilians caughtup in it. One million refugees ﬂed to Mali, a quar-
ter of a million camped beside the two railway
lines running from Zimbabwe to the sea. Famine
threatening half the 16 million people in Mozam-bique added to the huge death toll. In 1990 theefforts of mediators from Kenya and Zimbabwe
and the international community succeeded in
bringing the Frelimo government and the MNR
to the negotiating table, Frelimo having aban-
doned Marxism–Leninism. In 1993 the situationlooked more hopeful than in Angola; a ceaseﬁreand UN-supervised elections established peace;
the discovery of oil should have helped repair
some of the devastation.Africa is in crisis. Independence had not broughtthe hoped-for benefits in the longer term.
Political freedom had not altered economic fun-
damentals. Dependent on world prices for their
primary export products – coffee, cotton, cocoa,palm oil and minerals such as copper – Africansremained poor during the last quarter of the
twentieth century, though there were a few good
years. During the good years the West lent money
for development, but after modest advances in the
1960s the huge rises in oil prices in the 1970scontributed to stagnation and decline as thenations struggled with mountains of debt and
falling earnings from what they produced, nor in
countries blessed with oil like Nigeria and Angola
did the people beneﬁt as corruption siphoned offthe earnings. During the 1980s African develop-ment went into reverse. But this was not solely
due to world economic conditions.Africa’s nations have airlines and some splen-did public buildings but these are mere symbols
of nationhood. Since their borders were based onEuropean colonial partitions, tribal, cultural andreligious differences run like fault-lines through
many of the forty-seven African nations – fault-
lines which, at their most extreme, have caused
civil war, as they have in Nigeria. As the 1990sbegan, civil war raged seemingly without end inthe Sudan, as it had since independence. At best,
tribal conﬂicts made it difﬁcult to create func-
tioning states founded on representative govern-774AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE
ment – this was true of Zimbabwe. In SouthAfrica the ﬁghting between the Inkatha Zulu-based black movement and the ANC was just one
of the more serious obstacles to creating a non-
racist nation.The widening gulf between the few who wererich and the poor masses made any genuinedemocracy difficult to achieve. Survival rather
than representative government was the people’s
ﬁrst concern. Survival in the conditions prevailing
in Africa required ingenuity, breaking laws when
necessary, taking advantage of patronage anddeals, engaging in bribes in return for favours.To overcome the divisiveness within theAfrican nations, strongmen with their own tribal
base and with military backing became a common
post-colonial feature, only to exacerbate that verydivisiveness. A few authoritarian rulers, afteralmost three decades, survived into the 1990s:
Mobutu in the Congo, Houphouët-Boigny in the
Ivory Coast and Hastings Banda in Malawi, but
old age and political change had removed thefathers of other nations. President Kaunda ofZambia, twenty-seven years in power after inde-
pendence in 1964, allowed himself in 1991 to be
elected out of ofﬁce – a rare occurrence in Africa.
President Nyerere made a digniﬁed voluntary exit,
unlike President Barre of Somalia, who was over-thrown by rebels. Many years of unchallengeableand uninterrupted power inevitably bred corrup-
tion and the patronage of a favoured tribe.
Bureaucracies on state payrolls became swollen,
though soldiers’ pay tends to have priority – whenit runs out, as it did in the Congo, anarchy threat-ens. Western loans did little to promote sound
development, and much of the money was
wasted. Now black Africa is saddled with a debt
mountain. Meanwhile, some African leaders
enriched themselves, living in luxury and misap-propriating their country’s earnings, to besecreted in bank accounts abroad.African nations also embarked on unsuitableeconomic policies which, in the end, were disas-
trous. Central planning and state ownershipcaused a deterioration in what had previouslybeen more efﬁciently managed in private hands.
Nor did the dash for growth through industrial-
isation result in products that could competeinternationally. Agriculture was neglected andprices of farm produce kept artiﬁcially low. Theauthorities’ emphasis on cash crops for exports
meant that food for the people was neglected.
Economic growth in the 1980s was among the
lowest of the world’s underdeveloped nations.The European Union with its subsidised marketsgrieviously hurt African farmers.In sub-Saharan Africa food production actuallyfell by a ﬁfth in the two decades after 1970, but
the population was increasing annually by more
than 3 per cent and by the 1990s had reached530 million. Drought, famine and wars hadcreated millions of refugees; those who survived
ended up in camps dependent on Western chari-
table aid. Yet, despite man-made disasters, AIDS
and the calamities of nature, the population ofAfrica would continue to increase rapidly.The end of the Cold War also had an enor-mous impact, for both good and bad. The super-
power antagonists no longer jockeyed for
inﬂuence in Africa or bribed leaders with theirfavourite imports – weapons. They no longerbacked opposing sides in civil wars, thereby
engaging in power struggles by proxy. The con-
clusion of the Cold War also meant that less inter-
est was now shown in propping up nations or
ending ruinous civil conﬂicts: economic reformsand restructuring were insisted on before moreaid was granted. In countries with living standards
as low as those in Africa, what was right in text-
book theory could be politically disastrous and
lead to mass unrest when subsidised food becametoo dear.Transition from authoritarian rule to democ-racy is not a smooth process anywhere. Africa,
where old tribal rivalries and political conﬂicts

have long been suppressed, is no exception. When
the strongman or the one-party state backed byruthless security forces is toppled, new conﬂicts –even anarchy – may follow.There was a positive side as the twentiethcentury moved into its last decade: some civil wars,
such as that in Namibia, ended. There emergedblack leaders of wisdom and humanity like NelsonMandela, who assured South Africa of a better
future. The hope was that the lessons of past mis-

takes were being learnt. Half a century after the1SOUTHERN AFRICA775
struggles for independence, Africa faced as great achallenge again to alleviate the consequences ofcivil wars, to prevent new conﬂicts from breaking

out, to end those still in progress, to feed thepeople and to match the growth of populationwith development best suited to Africa’s needs.That is the hope – even as corruption, wars and
famines still deface the continent.776AFRICA AFTER 1945: CONFLICT AND THE THREAT OF FAMINE

THE UNITED STATES AND THE
SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963: THEGREAT TRANSFORMATION
During the Brezhnev years, the Soviet Union’srelationship with the outside world began to
change signiﬁcantly. The Kremlin now accepted
that an armed clash with the West was unlikely,provided the Soviet Union was strong enough toensure that war would prove suicidal for both
sides. It was paradoxically also an era of rapid
growth in nuclear-missile armaments.Latitude was permitted to the Warsaw Pactallies to develop their economies on less rigidlystate-planned lines. In János Kádár’s Hungarylimited private enterprise, various incentives and
Western loans turned a stagnant economy into
what was, for a time, a ﬂourishing one, by the
previous standards of the people’s republics. ButKádár knew where to draw the line and acceptedthe diktat imposed by Soviet intervention in
1956. The Polish economy, despite large Western
loans, failed to make much progress. The general
detente between East and West in the 1970s and
the recognition of Poland’s existing frontiers atthe Helsinki Conference in 1975 eased relations,but popular criticism of the Communist Party’s
failure to improve living conditions led to recur-
rent crises. Nationalism was strong in Eastern
Europe, and anti-Russian feeling was kept barelybelow the surface.Communism appeared safest in the rigid handsof the orthodox leadership of the German
Democratic Republic: the Protestant Church was
the only organisation left capable of any opposi-tion, but it raised its voice mildly, while expressingloyalty to the state. Romania, equally orthodoxunder the Stalinist rule of Nicolae Ceaus¸escu, fol-
lowed an uncomfortably nationalistic and inde-
pendent course. The Soviet Union did notdiscourage the people’s republics from seekingWestern economic assistance or trade; their devel-
opment also assisted the Soviet Union, which
delivered oil at advantageous prices in return for
more advanced technological manufactures, for
example computer chips from the DDR. The USand Western embargo on the sale of goods such asadvanced computers made this technical support
especially valuable. But Soviet troops were still sta-
tioned in Eastern Europe as members of the
Warsaw Pact and as ultimate guarantors of Sovietdominance.There were limitations to sovereignty. TheSoviet leadership imposed two conditions on the
Eastern European states within its security sphere:
that each should adhere to the Warsaw Pact
alliance and that the Communist Party shouldexercise sole political power. The coalition part-
ners, the other small political parties to be found in
Poland and the German Democratic Republic,
were mere satellites, agreeing with whatever course
the Communist Party decided to follow. Their realinﬂuence was non-existent. The Communist Partywith its nomenklatura– the network of appointeesoccupying all key posts in administration, industry
and party – took its instructions from the Politburo
and derived its privileges and income from thesystem. All this was in accordance with Lenin’s1Chapter 67THE SOVIET UNION AND THE WIDERWORLD, THE BREZHNEV YEARSCRUSHING THE PRAGUE SPRING AND THEFAILURE OF REFORM
principle that there could be discussion within theparty but that there could be no anti-party: onlyone party was allowed.The Hungarians had broken both conditions in 1956. A decade later, in 1968, the Czech lead-ership of Alexander Dubcˇek appeared to theKremlin to be following the same dangerous
course. Dubcˇek’s ‘Prague Spring’, granting great-er freedom to press and radio, and promising economic reform, was intended to modernisesocialism, to create ‘socialism with a human face’,
turning it into an attractive system of government
rather than a repressive one to be feared. ButDubcˇek’s reforms appeared to be heading towardsthe forbidden shores of ‘democracy’, a multi-party
system that would reduce the power of the
Communist Party machine. The reforms were
immensely popular, and started the process ofreplacing control from above by support and con-sent from below. Was Czechoslovakia only a step
away from abandoning the Soviet alliance for the
West? The Kremlin’s fears were exaggerated; withthe experiences of Hungary before them, theCzech leadership understood that they could not
afford to denounce the fraternal Soviet alliance.
Despite the international outrage that wouldensue, Brezhnev and the Politburo, after repeatedaltercations with the Czech leadership and debate
among themselves, opted for armed intervention.
The Prague Spring was crushed by Soviet tanks on20 August 1968. It was a clear indication of theKremlin’s continued paranoia about safeguarding
the frontiers of the USSR. The ﬁgleaf of interven-
tion by all the Warsaw Pact allies – Romania alonerefusing – only made a bad situation worse whenEast German troops entered Prague thirty years
after Hitler’s Wehrmacht had crossed the frontiers
of a democratic and sovereign Czechoslovakia.The Soviet justiﬁcation was embodied in theso-called Brezhnev Doctrine, which held that
socialist states (that is, communist) had the right
to intervene if a neighbouring ally threatened torevert to capitalism. That, it was claimed, repre-sented a danger to all; by Soviet deﬁnition this
unnatural course could only be the result of inter-
nal and external Western subversion.Little more than a decade after the Prague Springand the reimposition of one-party communist rulein Czechoslovakia, the Politburo faced whatlooked like a similar challenge to the BrezhnevDoctrine in Poland.The economic failure of the Polish communistregime in the 1970s became evident when the
dash for modernisation based on heavy industriesand Western technology landed the regime deeplyin debt. Agriculture, though largely in the hands
of small peasant farmers, lacked the investment
necessary to make it productive. To provide food
at prices the urban population could afford on
their low wages required heavy state subsidies.The huge rise in oil prices in 1973–4 added to the country’s woes. When the government
attempted to improve its economic management
by cutting food subsidies, workers marched in
protest at the ensuing price rises. From 1976onwards, despite arrests and repression, the Polishmasses could no longer be totally subdued by the
regime. Intellectuals led by Jacek Kuron´ set up aWorkers’ Defence Committee, demanded the
release of arrested workers, and insisted on truthinstead of lies, the reality of justice in place ofrhetoric and propaganda. Polish nationalism was
further encouraged by the visit of the Polish Pope
John Paul II in 1979. An alliance formed with the
workers by Catholics, intellectuals and other
opponents presented a powerful challenge to theregime. Another rise in food prices in the summerof 1980 sparked off strikes and a nationwide
political confrontation.It began in the Lenin Shipyard at Gdan
´sk. An
electrician, Lech Wae¸sa, emerged to become a
national hero. The striking workers at Gdan
´sk
proved more determined than the communist
leadership. The Gierek regime, forced into negoti-

ations, effected a tactical retreat, promising to
allow the setting up of free trade unions, the right
to strike, freedom of the press, and the right of reli-
gious organisations to propagate their faith. Thenew free trade union was called Solidarity and soon
attracted 9 million members, presenting as it did
an alternative organisation to the Communist
Party and to communist satellite organisations.Though it had in theory accepted the ‘leading roleof the Communist Party’ and claimed not to be a
political party, it nonetheless represented a political
challenge to the communist state. The Polish780THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
Communist Party was losing its grip. It is likelythat the alarmed Kremlin signalled the need for aPolish (rather than Soviet) crackdown, especially as
the Soviet Union had become embroiled in the
civil war in Afghanistan. Even so, in Poland there
was much talk of a possible Soviet intervention.General Jaruzelski, austere and colourless, pre-empted any such move by declaring martial law in
December 1981 and by establishing a communist
military regime. The army proved reliable and,
even though the Communist Party lost so much
credibility that it could never recover, Jaruzelskiimposed a martial peace. Solidarity leaders werearrested or driven underground. But the Jaruzelski
decade could not solve Poland’s fundamental
problems nor cow the spirit of Solidarity. In cen-

tral Europe Soviet dominance was upheld with dif-
ficulty. Cracks were showing – but no oneexpected that the whole system would disintegrate
before the 1980s had ended.Brezhnev was anxious to present a peacefulimage of Soviet intentions. The missile and spaceprogrammes were costly but only by catching upcould the Soviet Union treat with the US as an
equal partner and perhaps limit this huge drain on
resources. Anything that extended the capabilities
of conventional warfare or that raised tensions
would not only impede the attempts to halt thecontinued increase of nuclear armament expendi-
ture, but provoke an inexorable rise in the cost of
conventional weapons as NATO increased its own
military preparedness. Thus Brezhnev welcomed
West Germany’s readiness to promote relaxed rela-
tions with the East German regime and to reassurePoland that its new western frontier, which
enclosed within Poland former German territories,
would never be changed by force. West Germany
became an essential trading partner of East
Germany. That was incentive enough for the com-
munist regime. But the easing of movementbetween the two Germanies and an effective settle-

ment of confrontation in Berlin by four-power
treaties in 1971 and 1972 (which reaffirmed
Western rights in the city) made a real contributionto a more peaceful international atmosphere. TheFederal Republic also recognised the DDR.This reluctance to become directly involved inother countries’ affairs during the 1970s was par-ticularly marked in Asia, until the invasion ofAfghanistan in December 1979. The develop-ment of friendly relations between the Soviet
Union and India in the 1970s and 1980s is one
of the few success stories of Soviet foreign policy.
But it did not come cheaply. The Soviet Unionsupplied substantial military and economic aid.And good relations with India meant, almost
inevitably, bad relations with Pakistan. These
were exacerbated by Brezhnev’s decision – there
were rumours in Moscow that he was drunk at
the time – to invade Afghanistan in December1979. That invasion was, however, a logicalextension of the Brezhnev Doctrine to a neigh-
bouring state whose communist regime had to be
maintained against the revolt of Muslim funda-
mentalists, even though they enjoyed widepopular support.A successful coup to place an efﬁcient Afghancommunist puppet in power supported by a brief
intervention was what the Kremlin had antici-

pated. Instead the Soviet armed forces had to bereinforced until they exceeded 100,000. Themujahideen in their mountain strongholds could
not be wiped out by helicopter rocket attacks.
The communist Afghan army and Soviet troops
controlled the cities and the main lines of com-
munication, but in the rugged countryside andmountains the mujahideen, fortiﬁed by Americanweapons and by rear bases in Pakistan, proved
unbeatable. Non-combatants streamed into refu-
gee camps in Pakistan, thus relieving the ﬁghting
units of their care. For Brezhnev the long war wasa treble disaster. For the privates conscripted toﬁght in Afghanistan and for their families, the
endless struggle (which was to bring 60,000 casu-
alties) against largely hidden enemies far away
from home was a heavy and unpopular burden.
For the Red Army generals the war was an oppor-tunity to try out tactics and weapons and todemand more and better tanks, guns and planes.
These could not be denied them, and Brezhnev
had to ﬁnd and divert resources to meet new 
military needs. Finally, Washington’s failure tounderstand Soviet motivation put pay, at least fora time, to detente, and impeded – in critical areas,
halted – Western technological assistance so badly
needed in the USSR.1THE BREZHNEV YEARS781
Apart from Afghanistan, the Soviet Union’spolicy in Asia was cautious. It supplied onlylimited help to the North in the Vietnamese civil
war, and took care not to respond in kind to
American intervention on the ground. The most
serious problem in Asia was the hostility of China.The Sino-Soviet split, which had opened up inthe days of Khrushchev,deepened with Mao’s radi-

calisation in the 1970s. Mao condemned Soviet
relaxation of repression as counter-revolutionary.
The Chinese also criticised the invasion of
Czechoslovakia and saw themselves as the onlytrue centre of the world communist movement.This did not stop them from improving relations
with the US in the 1970s: in Chinese eyes, the
arch-enemy now was not Western imperialism but
Soviet ‘hegemony’. In 1969 serious armed clashesoccurred in places along the Sino-Soviet border,the longest frontier in the world. The USSR had
stationed crack divisions armed with nuclear 
missiles to defend its territory. A paranoia akin to
that provoked by the ‘yellow peril’ at the turn ofthe century began to take a grip on the Kremlin.The sheer size of China, with a population ﬁve
times greater than that of the Soviet Union, and
with a radical and xenophobic leadership, pre-
sented an increasingly nightmarish threat to
Moscow. From the 1960s until the early 1980speriods of vituperative exchanges alternated withSoviet efforts to place relations with Beijing on 
a better footing. But everywhere in Asia, for
example in India and Vietnam, Soviet diplomacy
and aid were countered by Chinese diplomacy andaid, as in Kampuchea and Pakistan.The Soviet Union’s ambitions to extend itsinﬂuence to the Third World and the Middle East
in the 1960s and 1970s brought little reward and
created obstacles in the path of detente. In Africa,
poverty, ethnic and racial conﬂicts and the ﬁercenew nationalism provided fertile ground for theproselytising of the authoritarian socialist system
as the only way out of the continent’s cycle of
devastation and deprivation. The Eastern bloc
gave support to movements struggling to over-throw the last vestiges of white supremacy inPortuguese Africa, Rhodesia and South Africa.
The global East–West struggle was thus extended
to Africa. But Moscow’s new clients were ﬁckle.When Nasser’s successor Anwar Sadat couldnot get what he wanted from Moscow he showedno gratitude for the huge amount of civil and mil-

itary aid (including training in modern weapons
technology) which Egypt had received – the largest
amount of aid the Soviet Union had supplied toany single country during the two decades from1955 to 1976: $4,750 million. In 1972, Sadat
ordered Soviet personnel to leave the country and
took over the installations and weapons they had
to leave behind. It was a valuable lesson: whatever
the complexity of the indigenous government,socialist or not, its authoritarian leaders soughtonly to exploit superpower rivalry in pursuit of
their own interests. Other African countries
accepted Soviet aid and tutelage only to break with
the Soviet Union, and expel Russian advisers. Thelist is long: Algeria, Ghana, Mali, Sudan, Somaliaand Equatorial Guinea. More enduring was Soviet
inﬂuence in Ethiopia, Angola and Mozambique.
Colonel Gaddaﬁ, the Libyan leader, proved more
of an embarrassment, since his support of terroristgroups and his territorial ambitions in Chad havebeen strong destabilising factors.In the Middle East, Syria was Russia’s mostreliable ally. After the fall of the Shah of Iran in
1979, Iraq too became the recipient of Soviet
arms as Moscow sought to check Khomeini’sMuslim fundamentalists, who cursed not only theAmerican devil but also atheistic Russia. With mil-
lions of Soviet Muslims susceptible to an Islamic
resurgence, Khomeini’s ideology posed a new
threat to Soviet stability.In Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s theSoviet Union had gained its ﬁrst communist ally
in Cuba. Castro was no easy bedfellow and the
promise to purchase Cuba’s sugar crop, previ-
ously exported to the US, in order to keep the
Cuban economy aﬂoat cost the USSR thousandsof dollars annually in the 1980s. The SovietUnion’s client states in Africa, the Middle East
and Asia were a further enormous drain on
resources which were so badly needed to mod-
ernise the Soviet Union itself and raise the livingstandards of the Russian people. World aid wasunpopular in the Soviet Union, whose citizens
point to the saying that charity should begin at
home.782THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
Central to Soviet foreign policy was detentewith the US, which in the 1970s and 1980s couldby itself enhance overall security and reduce the
military budget. The exorbitant expense of devel-
oping modern weapons and of attempting to frus-
trate the US Strategic Defence Initiative, or ‘StarWars’, became a Soviet nightmare. The muchgreater industrial and technological capacity of
the US and the West meant that it was essential
to the Soviet Union to set limits on the develop-
ment and deployment of nuclear weapons. In a
non-nuclear war, moreover, the outcome wouldbe determined by the sophistication of conven-tional weapons. American cruise missiles without
nuclear warheads could still cause havoc, destroy-
ing command centres; superior aircraft and anti-
radar devices could penetrate Soviet airspace. Somilitary budgets had simultaneously to carry theburden of conventional-weapons development.
But to have provided all the armaments that the
military were clamouring for would have crippled
any attempt to improve living standards for theordinary Soviet citizen, when it was in any casebecoming increasingly difﬁcult in the second half
of the 1970s to raise national production. Worst
of all, the failure to give the Soviet people some
sense of material progress would undermine
morale, arouse nationalist rivalries between theconstituent republics and so threaten the stabilityof the whole Soviet system.Brezhnev and his successors responded to thisdire predicament by launching peace offensives.
Brezhnev and Andropov repeatedly declared thatthe nuclear arsenals of the superpowers were morethan sufﬁcient to serve deterrent purposes and that
no nuclear war was ‘winnable’. As Andropov put it,
‘One has to be blind to the realities of our time not
to see that, wherever and however a nuclear whirl-

wind arises, it will inevitably go out of control andcause a worldwide catastrophe.’ The Soviet Unionand the US, however suspicious they might be of
each other, also shared common interests. One 
of the most important was to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons. Accordingly they concluded on 1July 1968 a treaty on the non-proliferation ofnuclear weapons, which bound them to refrain
from assisting non-nuclear nations to obtain or
make nuclear weapons. Although the treaty hasbeen signed by more than a hundred countries,nuclear-weapon capability continues to spread; thesupposed safeguard of inspection by the Inter-

national Atomic Energy Agency is proving ineffec-

tive in such countries as Israel and Iraq.During the 1970s there was a rational dialoguebetween the Soviet Union and the US about howa nuclear war between them, which would destroy
both countries, could best be guaranteed never to
take place. The answer they found seems perverse.They concluded that it could best be prevented byensuring that both countries would indeed perish.
This could be effected by a treaty severely limiting
the defences that could be set up to destroy incom-
ing nuclear missiles. The Treaty on the Limitationof Anti-ballistic Missile Systems, known as the
ABM Treaty, was signed on 26 May 1972 during
a visit to Moscow by President Nixon. On thesame day an Interim Agreement on Limitation ofStrategic Offensive Arms, known as SALT I, was
also concluded. The US already had more than
enough nuclear missiles to destroy the SovietUnion.MAD, mutual assured destruction, was thename given to this doctrine that was designed to
ensure peace. Then the impetus for further disar-
mament came to a halt. SALT II, negotiated byPresident Carter and Brezhnev, and apparently
sealed when the Russian leader kissed the US 
president on the cheek in Vienna on 18 June 1979,was refused ratiﬁcation by the US Senate. It had
sought to reduce the nuclear weaponry on each
side, but it was a dead letter after the Soviet inva-

sion of Afghanistan in December 1979; there nowappeared to be no prospect for negotiationtowards SALT III to reduce offensive weapons on
both sides. But during the Brezhnev period mean-

ingful Soviet–US negotiations had begun to ﬁnd a

way out of the blind alley of piling on more andmore weapons of mass destruction. After an inter-
val of nearly a decade, Gorbachev and Reagan 
in the second half of the 1980s resumed this
sequence of mutual accommodation in the inter-
ests of the Soviet Union and the US, and indeed ofthe whole world.The seventeen Brezhnev years, together with abrief postscript, marked the ﬁnal phase of author-itarian, monolithic communist rule, a military1THE BREZHNEV YEARS783
superpower with economic feet of clay, an empireof nationalities held together by force. Not untilwell after Brezhnev’s death in 1982 did the West,
to its own astonishment, recognise how weak-
ened the Soviet Union had become. It has been
another example of how the undercurrents ofchange in history accumulate slowly, until thereis a sudden disintegration of stability evident to
everyone.The Soviet Union was losing the race with theWest, unable to present a viable and attractive
alternative to market capitalism and democracy.These were the years when the communist lead-ership tried to reform and to make their system
work better. The results in the early years were
mixed; the exploitation of Russia’s rich oil and
mining resources at a time of high energy pricesin the 1970s provided a boost. But the lack ofinvestment had dire consequences as factories
were not renewed and the infrastructure, roads
and means of communication, was neglected.
Vast sums were diverted to the military. Maxi-mum exploitation without thought for pollutionprepared the way for ecological disasters. A vast
bureaucratic machine, which could only stifle 
initiative, had to be paid for. With increasingly
outdated technology and lacking incentives, the
Soviet worker became hopelessly unproductive.In the end, though ‘reform communism’ didproduce changes and some improvements, they
were not enough to save the system.Twenty years earlier, the ﬁrst attempt to givethe communist state a new face had ended withthe fall of Khrushchev. The Politburo for a timepreferred not to trust any one successor after that.
In 1964, three leading members were assigned
the principal ofﬁces of state: Nicolai Podgorny
became president, Leonid Brezhnev party leader
and Alexei Kosygin chairman of the Council ofMinisters. Kosygin was an able technocrat whowas well aware of the shortcomings of the Soviet
economic performance. In place of Khrushchev’s
sudden changes, Kosygin, very much in harmony
with the thinking of his two colleagues, attempteda more consistent and gradual approach.The task the Soviet leaders set themselves wasto improve standards of living, to keep the KGB
under control, to catch up technologically andquantitatively in the military sector, whose back-wardness America’s missile superiority had socruelly exposed during the Cuban crisis, and 
to do all this without creating new tensions in
Soviet–American relations. The course set was
one of reform and ambitious development, butthe political system and central control were notto be weakened, let alone endangered. Brezhnev
was to become the leading exponent of this policy
of trying to please everyone, particularly the three
main pillars of the communist system, the party
hierarchy, the bureaucrats and the army. The anti-religious course followed by Khrushchev was alsodampened down. Given these priorities, the room
for change and development was severely circum-
scribed. Progress between 1964 and 1984 was
very uneven. After a spurt from 1961 to 1975,which owed something to the economic reformsintroduced by Kosygin, there was stagnation.But the changes achieved in the Soviet Unionwere not fundamental: prices of input materials
and output product were still ﬁxed by the centralplanners; the ‘proﬁt’ incentive introduced into
the pricing structure could therefore be arbitrar-
ily adjusted. Nevertheless the new incentive pro-
vided a stimulus to industrial managers and to
workers, who welcomed bonus payments for
higher productivity. During the decade from1970 to 1980, 1 million workers were redeployedin the more efﬁcient sectors of industry, thus

reducing chronic overmanning and increasing
productivity. But the central planners, Gosplan
and the ministries continued to set prices, ﬁx pro-duction targets and control supplies.The approach to economic reform was piece-meal, and good results were achieved in only a few
sectors of the economy, which were held back
from making faster progress by the backward sec-
tors, the lack of communications, poor roads,widespread corruption, mismanagement and anoverall lack of coordination, each ministry seeking
to achieve the best results statistically in its own
sphere without regard to the whole. This ‘sec-
tional’ approach rarely brought any beneﬁts to theconsumer, unless a particularly efﬁcient sectionactually produced what consumers required.
Sometimes this had bizarre consequences. The
strategic rocket forces began to produce the best784THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
refrigerator, and the Ministry of Aviation manu-factured an excellent vacuum cleaner.The army had backed the overthrow ofKhrushchev and had beneﬁted from the increas-
ing defence expenditure necessary to achieve
parity with the US in nuclear and missileweaponry and to remedy Russia’s inferiority onthe high seas. The strengthening of the armed
forces from 1964 to 1974 was dramatic and
absorbed a disproportionate part of the Soviet
budget. But Brezhnev also wanted to preside over
a consumer boom, and the armed forces and theirministries saw a chance for proﬁt. They began byproviding goods for their own military and civil-
ian personnel – vegetables, prams and so on –
then their products became more widely available.
The problem of how to relate consumers and pro-ducers in a centrally directed economy without amarket mechanism, in a system where prices and
costs are arbitrarily fixed, was neither tackled 
nor solved. Could such an economy be reformed
and adjusted to meet Soviet requirements, and yetretain its socialist character? That was the basicquestion that confronted reformers from the
1960s to the 1980s.With the relaxation of repression and increas-ing contact with the West, the Soviet citizen, 
especially in the major cities, became more sophis-ticated. Complaints and criticisms were articu-
lated. One of the few success stories of the 
Soviet Union is the spread of education. Though
loyalty to the Soviet state remained a basic
requirement, education was provided on merit.This created a large educated class. Critical discus-sion began in the 1960s and 1970s among enquir-
ing groups of university students, one of which
included Mikhail Gorbachev; it encompassed pro-
fessional circles of a whole new post-war genera-
tion but had to be conducted discreetly andprivately. The thaw that had begun withKhrushchev could no longer be reversed in the
Brezhnev era. But strict limits were set and exem-
plary punishment imposed on the most prominent
dissidents, who courageously continued to speakout publicly – outstanding men such as AndreiSakharov, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Andrei
Sinyavsky and Yali Daniel. Some of the most
prominent dissidents were Jewish. Anti-Semitismincreased, and Zionism was equated with treach-ery. Jews who applied to leave the Soviet Unionwould lose their jobs, though some were eventu-
ally permitted to emigrate. But the restrained
repression of a ‘reformed’ KGB, placed under the
control of Yuri Andropov, could only contain, noteradicate, the by now widespread dissident move-ment. Duplicating machines acted as an under-
ground press, whose samizdateditions passedthrough hundreds of hands. That dissent ﬂour-
ished is evidence of the courage of a section of the
intelligentsia; years of communist propagandacould not obliterate independent thought.Now that world opinion was concerning itselfwith the fate of the dissidents, the Soviet author-
ities could no longer behave as they had in
Stalin’s time. Moreover, the Soviet Union hadofﬁcially adhered to the Helsinki Agreement of1975, promising to respect basic human rights;
this provided the protesters with some legal
standing, at least internationally. The denial to
Soviet Jews of permission to emigrate was coun-tered by American congressional pressure whichlinked credit and trade concessions to the USSR
to Soviet liberality in allowing Jews to leave
(Senator Jackson’s amendment) at a time when
American imports were of particular value to the
Russians. Moscow reacted angrily to what itregarded as unwarranted Western interference inSoviet affairs. Over the longer term, however, the
growing links with the West made mass repres-
sion of dissenting opinion impossible. In the
1970s the ‘prisoners of conscience’ in the SovietUnion, suffering hardship from house arrest toexile, from hard labour to forced detention in psy-
chiatric institutions, were numbered in thousands,
rather than the millions of Stalin’s day, and exe-
cutions ceased.For the mass of Soviet peoples the awareness ofpoor living conditions coincided with the improve-
ments made during the Brezhnev years. Grain pro-

duction from 1964 to 1969 averaged 156 million
tonnes a year, but varied in a particular year from a
low of 121 million (1965) to a high of 171 million(1966). The average only just covered basic Sovietneeds – there were no longer any famines or short-

ages of bread. But the people wanted more variety,
more milk, more meat and more vegetables.1THE BREZHNEV YEARS785
Agricultural production, though higher, could notkeep pace with what was required.Increased use of fertilisers, higher payments tofarmers, the introduction of a number of incen-
tives, including licences for larger private plots
and allowing sales on a free market once produc-
tion quotas were reached, all these reforms of the
Brezhnev years failed to satisfy the growing
demand. The deﬁcit had to be covered by grain
imports, above all from the plenitude of American
overproduction, until the invasion of Afghanistan
in 1979 and the resulting US grain embargo
forced a switch to other suppliers. More meat was
made available; between 1970 and 1985, theaverage consumption rose by half. But grain pro-duction continued to vary widely from year to
year. About 210 million tonnes was the normal
annual requirement. A bumper harvest in 1978
produced 237 million tonnes, which covered all
the grain requirements of the Soviet Union; but
the following year the ﬁgure dropped to 180

million tonnes; in 1980 it rose to 189 million
tonnes, only to drop again in 1981 to a cata-
strophic 160 million tonnes, requiring the impor-
tation of 46 million tonnes of grain from abroad,
which used up valuable foreign currency reserves.
Incentives and reforms and high investment were
producing far from satisfactory results during theclosing years of the Brezhnev era.With more money earned, the averagemonthly wage almost doubling, farmers, trans-
port and construction workers doing even better
and miners trebling their income, the ordinary
Russian was living better and standing longer in
queues chasing the subsidised goods in state
shops or buying goods at high prices in the free
and semi-black markets. Vodka consumption and
alcoholism became an ever growing problem. The
available goods, other than those satisfying the
basic needs of shelter and food, were inordinately
expensive by Western standards and were gener-
ally of poor quality. But it needs to be borne inmind that a much smaller proportion of the wagepacket had to be spent on housing and the basics,
whose costs were ﬁxed arbitrarily low. The high
prices for other consumer goods acted as a form
of indirect tax to mop up excess money.Even so, the available consumer goods couldnot absorb the wages and millions of roublespiled up in savings accounts. The miner could not
buy better housing despite his savings; he was
rouble-rich but continued to live primitively. The
most prized possession of newly weds was privacyand a home of their own. But young marrieds hadto live for years with in-laws until a modest home
could be allocated. The next most prized posses-
sion was a car. The mass production of Fiat-
designed cars also started in the Brezhnev years
and, though by Western standards the proportionof car owners was low, by Soviet standards it wasremarkable that one in seven families possessed a
car, almost every household had a television set,
a third of them in colour, a refrigerator and a
washing machine. Leaving aside the chronic lackof space and the large number of extended familyhouseholds that ensued, in terms of domestic
labour-saving devices the average Soviet house-
hold had catapulted from pre-revolutionary con-
ditions to the modern age in less than twodecades. But if other indicators are considered,such as telephones and personal computers, the
differential between the West and the Soviet
Union remained huge. The economy as a whole
was grossly inefﬁcient in use of resources and 

burdened by out-of-date factories. Even moretrouble was in store as machines wore out, andpipes, valves and pumps in the oil industry leaked
and rusted. The Soviet Union could not even take
advantage of its rich resources, its grain rotting
for lack of transport and proper storage capacity.It was heading for a complete breakdown.The negative aspects of the Soviet commandeconomy and the one-party state hierarchy were
very evident. The burden of a stiﬂing bureaucracy,
the almost universal need for bribery, without
which little got done, and the irrational divisionbetween rival authorities, ministries and partyorganisations were hindrances enough. In addi-
tion, the privileges enjoyed by the nomenklatura,their special shops, hospitals and holiday resorts,
attracted jealousy and resentment. The residualheavy-handedness of the security services per-
sisted during the Brezhnev years. Long hours of
work were the norm for the average Soviet
citizen. The protection of the law was never786THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
certain, especially as it was almost impossible tolive strictly within it. The possession of a car, for instance, necessitated resource to the black
market for spare parts and services. Thus disre-
gard for the law, petty bribery and corruption
were endemic. Higher up the administrative elite,corruption was practised on a grandiose scaleduring the Brezhnev years. Brezhnev himself pro-
vided a prominent example of high living, owning
vast estates and a ﬂeet of luxury cars.Promotion for men and women of ability stillrequired the patronage of someone higher up inthe party or a ministry. Corruption was not con-ﬁned to the Kremlin but was widespread in the
Soviet republics, indeed had become legendary in
Georgia, where huge bribery allowed enterpris-
ing businessmen to build up private empires.Members of the nomenklaturalived in a stylereminiscent of American tycoons. For the privi-
leged few the products of the West were easily
available: Mercedes cars, hi-fi equipment and
Russian luxuries such as caviar. Andropov’s clean-up campaign while he was head of the KGB couldscratch only the surface, though it reached all the
way to Brezhnev’s family: his daughter, with her
diamonds, was a conspicuous consumer, while his
son Yuri, though often drunk, lived a charmed
life. The Western lifestyles of many of the chil-dren of the elite were bitterly resented by theaverage Russian.Brezhnev’s deliberate consumer boom hadnevertheless made many hitherto scarce goods
more readily available, though they were often ofpoor quality. One of the most intractable prob-lems of Soviet central planning was that the
demands that had to be satisﬁed were those of the
relevant ministries, not those of the consumer for
whom the goods were intended. The consumer
represented a mere abstract unit; the ministriesdecided what the consumer needed. Of course,the citizen’s wishes are not paramount in a
command economy. It can hardly be otherwise,
since no computer can be adequately pro-
grammed to take account of the complexities of consumer demand – the nationwide supply ofshoes of different qualities and prices, sizes and
fashions that would match consumers’ wishes, to
give just one example – and in any case powerfulcomputers were in short supply in the SovietUnion. Another bane of the system was the notorious ‘gross output’ indicator as a measure-
ment of the fulﬁlment of plans. The distortions
this created are illustrated by a factory that pro-
duced nails. Its target was set in terms of weight.The manager accordingly arranged for the man-ufacture of only very large and heavy nails. When
the ministry discovered this and set the target in
the form of quantity, the manager switched to
very small nails. The story is probably apocryphal
but it provides a good illustration of the short-comings inherent in central planning. Where theconsumer can set the requirements, as happened
for instance in the supply of weapons for the
armed services, the Soviet Union did better. The
Soviet space enterprise, another example, caughtup with the West and was perhaps even more reliable than America’s NASA.The record of the Brezhnev era was uneven. Astart was made in economic reforms, though
without questioning fundamentals. The exploita-tion of the Soviet Union’s vast mineral resources– the oil and gas and gold in Siberia and east of
the Urals – and the limited introduction of
Western technology raised output, but the greater
part of industry was not renewed. The restraints
placed on the KGB and the better life enjoyed bythe Soviet people were positive aspects, but theSoviet authoritarian system was not democratised
in any essential. Brezhnev’s determination to sta-
bilise the power base of the Soviet political struc-
ture entailed a policy of live and let live at the top:secure party ﬁefs and party cadres ensured stabil-ity, while corruption and privileges bought their
support. The ordinary people, however, had few
rights and had to do as they were told. This did
not preclude the emergence of able and incor-
ruptible party functionaries such as EduardShevardnadze, who as party chief in Georgiacarried through a wholesale purge of the sys-
tem erected by his corrupt predecessor. Yuri
Andropov, as head of the KGB, was of a similar
caste, and tried to rid the party of corruption.Although something like a cult of personalitywas fostered around Brezhnev, his power was not
absolute. During his last years of ill health much 
of the work had to be carried out by deputies. The1THE BREZHNEV YEARS787
growth of general public irreverence towards theleader was perhaps best shown by the many jokescirculating about him during those latter years.
Much had changed. No one would have dared to
joke about Stalin’s decline thirty years earlier. But
Brezhnev was perceived as a benevolent andincreasingly easy-going leader. Although livingconditions varied enormously from region to
region, while in the countryside housing contin-
ued to be neglected and primitive living condi-
tions persisted, life became better in the cities and
overall. The new freedom of movement allowedto the peasants increased the drift to the cities sotypical of countries in the underdeveloped world.Yuri Andropov seemed just the right choice totake over after Brezhnev’s death in November1982. His lifestyle was in complete contrast toBrezhnev’s. He lived very modestly and had built
his reputation on his shrewd handling of the
KGB, bringing that secret organisation under
control while maintaining its secrecy. He was areformer, but by no means a liberal in theWestern sense. Reform for Andropov meant
control by the party leadership, reform of the
communist state to achieve a more effective com-
munist system, striking a careful balance between
extra-legal repression of dissidence to maintainthe communist order and avoiding unnecessaryexcess and personal abuse of power. Exile and
detention in psychiatric hospitals were no longer
the result of personal whims but were carefully
calculated to deter dissent. The Western attitudeto justice and legality was not acceptable, despiteHelsinki, and the dissident Russian human-rights
group, which made it its task to monitor the
observance of the Helsinki Accords, was jailed or
driven into exile by Andropov.When expedient, Andropov made concessions,yielding to international pressure. Nearly 300,000Jews, who for many years had wished to emigrate,
losing their jobs and even suffering imprisonment
because they expressed this wish, were allowed to
leave. But outspoken critics were silenced. AndreiSakharov, the famous physicist, put under housearrest in 1980, continued to languish in Gorky.
The celebrated Nobel laureate, Alexander Solz-

henitsyn, long-time critic of repression, forciblydeported in 1974, was prevented from returning.Both had to wait until Andropov’s death andGorbachev’s succession. Executions were reserved
for serious corruption and could reach high in the
party ranks. As KGB chief, Andropov had built his
reputation on his fearless attack on high partybosses in a series of anti-corruption drives duringthe 1970s.The Politburo had chosen Andropov withouthesitation. To them his merit was that he was
ready to get the USSR moving again economic-
ally without endangering ideological orthodoxy.He was thus a reformer of the right kind, in theopinion of the majority of the Politburo. The suc-
cession did not fall, as expected, to Konstantin
Chernenko, who was too closely identiﬁed with
Brezhnev’s declining years. But Andropov himselfwas ill, and under his ailing leadership his princi-pal ally Gorbachev in 1983 took charge of a
special task force in a vain effort to stimulate eco-
nomic reform. An attempt was also made to
change the composition of party leadership in the regions and districts throughout the SovietUnion. Andropov’s health declined too rapidly
for these initiatives to bear much fruit; he spent
his last few months conﬁned to hospital with renal
failure and died in February 1984.Gorbachev at this time was regarded as tooyoung and too impetuous to be entrusted with theleadership and the post of general secretary of the
party. But it was evident that the course set by
Andropov was not to be abandoned. The septua-
genarian Chernenko took over, but the powerfulPolitburo determined policy, with Gorbachev incharge of the economy and one of the longest-
serving members, Andrei Gromyko, remaining in
charge of foreign affairs. Chernenko’s health like-
wise rapidly deteriorated; he was allowed to carry
on until his death (he died of the progressive lungdisease, emphysema) in March 1985. The deathsof three elderly leaders in the space of two and a
half years, far from projecting an image of reform
and change, created in the Soviet Union and the
wider world the perception of a country that hadbecome rigid in its ways and was presided over by a gerontocracy. That was about to change
dramatically.788THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
The 1960s and early 1970s were a distinctive anddecisive period in American history. They were
years of rapidly growing prosperity, but they were
also the years of the Vietnam War, disillusionmentand protest.The post-war economic boom passed allexpectations. The standard of living of most
Americans increased nearly every year. Was this
not a vindication of American free enterprise?
Americans had become citizens of an affluentsociety – at least most of them had – and had dis-covered the wonders of credit. Millions moved to
a better life in the sunbelt from Texas to
California. Florida became a haven for an older
generation. But in 1962 one in four Americans,over 42 million, were still living in dire poverty.That included nearly half the Afro-American pop-
ulation, single parents and children, the old and
sick, and the poor, who lacked education and
skills. From poverty-stricken Mexico, immigrants
entered California and Texas illegally to work forlow wages which Americans would not accept.From Puerto Rico and Latin America the poor,
seeking a better life, ﬁnished up in the deprived
housing of the inner cities. Here they joined the
native Americans, who had left their own barrenreservations. But the lot of the poor improveddramatically.President Johnson in his first State of theUnion address in 1964 declared ‘unconditional
war on poverty’. The federal government pumpedbillions of dollars into welfare and ambitious anti-poverty projects. Johnson’s Great Society pro-grammes worked. By 1973, the number of poor
had more than halved to 11 per cent. The anti-
liberal Nixon, though faced with increasingfederal deficits when he became president in1969, did not retrench seriously on welfare.
Positive anti-poverty measures taken by his
administration included increased social security
beneﬁts and greater expenditure on education;
federal housing subsidies were also continued.Nevertheless, the US was still a deeply dividedsociety; the liberal 1960s of welfare, of protest,
of student revolt and anti-Vietnam draft boycotts
was creating a backlash by construction workers
and outraged Middle America, which attributedthe rising crime rates and the disrespect shownby youth to excessive licence and softness. The
Americans who turned to Nixon saw in him a
president who would uphold America’s traditional
virtues.After his narrow defeat by Kennedy in 1960and, two years later, his devastating drubbing inthe contest for governor of California, Nixon’s
controversial political career seemed to have
ended. At what he thought would be his last press
conference, he hit back at the newsmen, who hefelt had never treated him fairly: ‘You won’t haveNixon to kick around any more.’ A few days later,
ABC Television broadcast a special, The PoliticalObituary of Richard Nixon. Nixon left hisCalifornia base and joined a law ﬁrm in New York,though in 1964 he supported the presidential1Chapter 68THE UNITED STATES
FROM GREAT ASPIRATIONS TO DISILLUSION
campaign of Barry Goldwater, who was well to theright of mainstream Republicans. In 1966 and1967 he rebuilt his political support as the man
best able to unite Republicans. By the time of the
party’s convention in 1968, he was once more the
obvious candidate to contest the next presidentialelection.Driving ambition and sheer hard work ratherthan privilege and a silver spoon got Nixon to the
White House. He saw himself as the underdog
who had had to make his own way. As president he
retained a sense that he faced danger from manyunscrupulous enemies and from an ill-disposedestablishment. Determined to defeat them, he
responded with conspiratorial ruthlessness. There
was a loneliness about his White House years, with
his reliance on a small team of White House polit-
ical staff, from whom he demanded absolute loy-
alty. For Nixon, safety would be guaranteed only if
he could gain control over those he believed
wished to discredit him and his policies. It all
ended with the Watergate ﬁasco and his resigna-
tion to avoid impeachment. But his performance aspresident during his ﬁrst administration won him

the trust and conﬁdence of a far greater majority of
American voters in the 1972 election than in the
lacklustre election of 1968.Nixon’s passion was to devise for America anew global strategy that would extricate it fromthe rigidities of the Cold War. He appointed
William P. Rogers, a former attorney-general
under Eisenhower, secretary of state. But in
shaping a new foreign policy he called on the helpof a Harvard professor, Henry A. Kissinger, to actas national security adviser. Kissinger replaced
Rogers as secretary of state when Rogers resigned
in the autumn of 1973. Kissinger proved a bril-
liant strategist in tackling contemporary inter-

national problems. The most pressing need wasto extricate the US from ﬁghting an endless warin Vietnam.Vietnam had divided the nation. During hiselection campaign Nixon promised that he had a
plan to end the war. The plan was to roll the ﬁlmbackwards, to the point before massive numbersof US combat troops had been sent to Vietnam,
and the hope continued to be that the American-
equipped South Vietnamese army plus punitivebombing by the US would force the NorthVietnamese to give up, the struggle. Kissinger wasas tough-minded as Nixon about the war, deter-
mined that it should not end in a humiliating
defeat. The US position he put forward at the
Paris peace negotiations – these had begun duringJohnson’s presidency in May 1968 – was that allforeign forces should leave South Vietnam, which
should then be left to decide its future in free
elections. This was unacceptable to the North
Vietnamese; they knew that whichever side organ-
ised the free elections would be sure to win them. They demanded a coalition government inSouth Vietnam, to include the communist South
Vietnamese National Liberation Front, which
they easily dominated after the Tet offensive had
inﬂicted terrible losses on the Vietcong.The Nixon plan was to Vietnamise the war onland and to bring US combat troops home in
stages. The Americans suffered heavy casualties in
1969 and were increasingly demoralised, many
soldiers resorting to cheap drugs. In 1968 USforces had reached their maximum of 536,100men; in 1969 they were reduced to 475,200; by
1971 their number had dropped to 157,800 and
when the armistice was signed in January 1973
only 23,500 were still left in Vietnam. But while
US troop reductions took place the air war wassecretly extended to Cambodia along the NorthVietnamese supply routes, the Ho Chi-minh trail.
(Kissinger’s plan and need for secrecy was due to
circumventing Congress which would have had to
approve war against a neutral state; the secrecy ofthe operations could not be maintained.) In April1970 American and South Vietnamese troops
actually invaded Cambodia, to the dismay of
American public opinion, which wanted to get
out of the war and not into a new one. On the
ground the North Vietnamese and Vietcong wereshowing no signs of weakening. Nixon’s onlyresponse was to step up again the bombing of
North Vietnam. Kissinger meanwhile had made
secret contact with the North Vietnamese nego-
tiator in Paris, Le Duc Tho, in February 1970.Not until the Americans were prepared toabandon their insistence that the North Viet-
namese forces in the South should withdraw at
the same time as the Americans could a deal be790THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
struck. With this vital concession, might a dealhave been made sooner saving many lives? It was bitterly opposed by the president of South
Vietnam, General Nguyen Van Thieu. If the
Americans left, the South Vietnamese would have
to face the full weight of the Vietminh in theSouth alone. There were hitches in the ﬁnal nego-tiations in Paris when the North Vietnamese
resisted amendments to the peace agreement. 
To persuade them, Nixon ordered the horriﬁc
Christmas bombing of Hanoi in December 1972.
The savage bombing causing indiscriminate civil-ian casualties was also a departing present for theSouth Vietnamese. On 27 January 1973 the com-
munist negotiators accepted a ceaseﬁre and con-
cluded a comprehensive agreement to end the
Vietnam war; the South Vietnamese were left noalternative but to join, since they were totallydependent on US support. Kissinger and Le Duc
Tho received the Nobel Prize for ending a war
that did not end.The last long-drawn-out stages from 1970 to1973 of what had become the most unpopularwar in US history continued to be accompanied
by protests at home. Nixon’s own reactions
tended to polarise the conﬂict between ‘conserv-
atives’ and ‘liberals’. In May 1970 National
Guardsmen ﬁred into a crowd of student demon-strators at Kent State University; four studentswere killed and several wounded, which shocked
even the conservatives. Protest swept American
university campuses. The war was still not over in
November 1972 when Nixon again presentedhimself to the electors.That Nixon won the presidential election by alandslide, with more than 60 per cent of the
popular vote, reveals the change in public feeling.
Nixon personally, shy, aloof and not entirelytrusted, was not popular; ‘Would you buy asecond-hand car from him?’ it was asked. But he
also appeared moderate and competent at home.
He and Kissinger capitalised on the conservative
backlash that was demanding law and order anda return to health of the American economy, andwas disillusioned with the costly Great Society
and the exaggerated aspirations of the Johnson
years. The boys were coming home from Vietnamand few now remained. Kissinger’s skilful han-dling of foreign affairs, the evidence of relaxationof tension with the Soviet Union, the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the arms-limitation
talks with Russia all helped to enhance the admin-
istration’s image. The greatest Nixon–Kissingercoup and the most surprising was the establish-ment of friendly relations with Mao’s China.
Their secret diplomacy began to show results
when the Chinese in April 1971 invited an
American table-tennis team to China. This was
followed by Kissinger’s own secret trip to Beijingto prepare the way for Nixon’s spectacular visit inFebruary 1972. The reorientation of US policy
strengthened the hand of US diplomacy the
world over. In May 1972 Nixon was in Moscow
signing an arms-limitation agreement; detentewas in full swing.That Nixon’s posture as a successful worldstatesman restoring US prestige after the frustra-
tions of Vietnam helped him to win a second term
in the presidency there can be no doubt. But hiselectoral victory was also aided by the weaknessof a divided opposition. The Democratic candi-
date, Senator George McGovern, did not prove a
strong vote-winner. Edward Kennedy, the last of
the Kennedy brothers, might have done, but his
chances of selection had disappeared three yearsearlier in the shallow waters at Chappaquiddick,where, in an accident when the car he was driving
plunged off a bridge, his lady companion was
drowned. The senator had not immediately raised
the alarm after the accident which led to contro-versy blighting his presidential ambitions.Within the space of less than two years Nixonfell from triumph to disgrace. But the world did
not entirely revolve around Watergate. The
‘Agreement to end the Vietnam war’ in January
1973 and the accompanying international decla-ration of support for it signed by twelve nationsin the presence of the secretary-general of the
United Nations was, despite its solemn promises,
bound to fail in its main purpose: the achievement
of peace. It left the opposing communist and anti-communist forces in control of their own areasand regions of South Vietnam. The advantage lay
with the North Vietnamese forces, which did not
have to withdraw north of the 17th parallel. Nor1THE UNITED STATES791
was Vietnam any closer to a political solution.The South Vietnamese government felt it hadbeen sold down the river, as the remaining US
forces progressively withdrew, the last departing
in March 1973. It was not quite like that. The
Americans handed over their installations to theSouth Vietnamese and supplied enormous quan-tities of equipment, until South Vietnam pos-

sessed the fourth-largest air force in the world. It
was up to the South Vietnamese government to
win the war, if it could.Neither the Vietcong nor the North Vietna-
mese nor the South Vietnamese had any intentionof honouring the armistice – though the commu-

nists were also on their own, both the Chinese and
the Russians having refused to help them further.
If the communists broke the agreement, as theydid, Nixon could have ordered new air strikes, butthis would have been unlikely to restrain them. By
the autumn of 1973, when fighting resumed,
Nixon was weakened by Watergate. The ﬁghting

continued until April 1975, when the communiststook Saigon. The end came swiftly. For the US theindescribable scenes as South Vietnamese men and
women, allies of the US, crowded on the stairs to
the roof of a CIA safe house close to the Embassy,
mostly in vain, desperately trying to join the heli-

copter evacuation of the American staff, marked agraphic and humiliating end to America’s efforts tosave South Vietnam from communism. The men
who had died in the war and those who had
returned – the Vietnam veterans – received little
honour or thanks. Americans wanted to forget thewar. In the words of Nixon’s successor PresidentGerald Ford, ‘Today, Americans can regain the
sense of pride that existed before Vietnam.’ He
rightly insisted that the tragic events ‘portend nei-

ther the end of the world nor of America’s leader-

ship in the world’. But this was wisdom after theevents. If only it had existed when Johnson mas-
sively involved the US between July 1965 and
March 1966.At home during his second administrationNixon had to grapple with inﬂation and the de-teriorating financial situation. He began bycutting back on some of the Great Society social
programmes. He devalued the dollar, and for a
time his administration imposed wage and pricecontrols. With the huge rise in Arab oil prices allWestern economies were in trouble in 1973 and1974. In the US, unemployment and inﬂation
were rising while production was falling, a state
of affairs that prevailed in most Western countries.
According to Keynesian economics, inflationshould have led to a growth in production andfalls in unemployment. Now the economic world
was topsy-turvy. A new term was coined to
describe what was afﬂicting the West – ‘stagﬂa-
tion’, stagnation plus inﬂation.In the political world, however, the Watergatescandal soon overshadowed all else. America’sallies were puzzled by the way US newspapers and
media hounded a president who had arguably
showed himself more successful in securing
American and Western interests, more far-sightedthan any other president in the twentieth century.Domestically, too, the Nixon presidency seemed
to be following moderate and sensible policies.
But American politics are rough, and dirty tricks
are nothing new. Illegal telephone-tapping,bribery and misuse of funds have been practisedby some of America’s most eminent leaders. The
press did not expose discreditable information
about all politicians or even all presidents. J. F.
Kennedy’s love-life was kept quiet; Martin Luther
King was bugged. The CIA and the FBI wereengaged in activities beyond anything that hadbeen sanctioned. Nixon believed he had many
enemies determined to get at him. The knives
were certainly out for him, but he had himself
contributed to this beleaguered atmosphere. TheWhite House staff were becoming a second secretadministration. They plotted how to strengthen
the president and how best to lay low his enemies.
Nixon was no outsider to these secret discussions.
They proved not to be so secret in the end
because he had them all taped.The Watergate story really began a year beforethe famous break-in with Nixon’s determination
to get at the opponents of his policies in Vietnam
and at home – at those, especially, who from
inside the civil service were leaking secret docu-ments to the press. The White House set up theSpecial Investigations Unit in the pursuit of their
undercover investigations. The Unit’s staff
became known as the Plumbers. It was they who792THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
organised the break-in at the Democratic Partycampaign headquarters in the Watergate Buildingin Washington in June 1972; the purpose was to
steal information to help Nixon and discredit the
Democrats during the presidential election cam-
paign. The burglars were caught. Nixon had notknown about the burglary beforehand, nor hadhe authorised the break-in, but some of his prin-
cipal aides were implicated. The White House
managed to keep the scandal from affecting the
elections in November 1972, which Nixon won
with a landslide majority, but the Watergate fusehad been lit, to detonate early in 1973 as the cul-prits were tried and threatened with severe sen-
tences. Some broke down and implicated the
president’s staff.Criminal charges against senior White Housestaff were nothing new in the 1970s, so why did it touch the president himself? The judicial
investigations dragged on for months, with the
president defending himself with ever-less con-
viction. The administration lost even more cred-ibility when Vice-President Spiro Agnew resignedafter a tax investigation unconnected with Water-
gate. When Nixon was forced by the Supreme
Court ﬁnally to hand over the White House tapes
it became irrefutably clear that early on the 
president had with his advisers tried to obstructjustice, desperately trying to distance the WhiteHouse from Watergate and other dirty tricks. The
cover-up proved Nixon’s undoing. To liberals,
Nixon and the White House conspiracies had
become a real danger to American civil libertiesand constitutional government. With impeach-
ment imminent, Nixon was the ﬁrst president to
resign. On 9 August 1974 he took off in a heli-
copter from the White House lawn, waving
goodbye to a small, tearful party. Outside the US,
where Nixon’s prestige stood high, the assess-ment was more cynical – Nixon’s mistake hadbeen to get caught. He continued to be received
with respect in China and elsewhere after his fall;
his advice and help in international affairs has also
been sought by succeeding presidents. The goodthat emerged from Watergate was that it acted asa warning to subsequent administrations; the
‘fourth estate’, the press, with its rights of inves-
tigation and freedom to publish and uncoverwrong doing, criminal breaches through execu-tive abuses, is a deterrent.The vice-president, Gerald Ford, was sworn in and saw Nixon’s term out. He began with an
unpopular move, granting a pardon to Nixon. Hegave the impression of a decent man, a cleanpolitician, but one who did not inspire and who
simply did not seem up to the job of running the
presidency. He frequently stumbled, sometimes
literally. His relations with Congress were poor
and American economic prospects worsened in1974 and 1975. In foreign affairs detente made alittle dubious progress but this was overshadowed
by sweeping communist victories in Vietnam and
Cambodia. To be sure, the blame for these cannot
be placed at Ford’s door; they were the results ofa situation he had inherited.Kissinger, appointed secretary of state, was thestar of the administration as he established new
records for ‘shuttle diplomacy’. During the
Middle Eastern crisis between Israel and theArabs (1973–5), world television showed the tire-less secretary of state stepping out of his personal
plane in Arab and Israeli airports at a dizzying
speed. He accomplished a provisional disengage-
ment and an end of hostilities between Egypt and
Israel in September 1975. The achievement wasall the more remarkable in that he won acceptanceby all sides concerned as a mediator of goodwill,
although he had entered the US in the 1930s as
a Jewish refugee from Nazi German persecution.Gerald Ford has probably been underrated. Hiscalm and reassuring manner helped to re-establishthe integrity of the presidency. He provided a tran-

sition from one of the lowest periods of American
self-conﬁdence, a period of violence and assassina-

tions at home, of Watergate and Vietnam. Middle
America was learning to appreciate less dynamic,less obviously ambitious politicians. They recog-
nised that Gerald Ford was an American like mil-

lions of others. The Democratic candidate for the
presidency, James Earl Carter, was another seem-

ingly ordinary American with whom millions couldidentify. In November 1976 the US electorate had a choice between two contenders ready to 
lead the world, neither of whom some two years
earlier had been heard of outside their immediate1THE UNITED STATES793
constituencies. Ford had been catapulted fromobscurity by Agnew’s resignation and the demiseof Nixon. Carter, former navy ofﬁcer and, after the

death of his father, successful peanut farmer, had
risen to become governor of Georgia – a reforming
and successful governor. By a narrow margin,Carter beat Ford and thereby ended eight years of Republican power in the White House. But 
the economic fortunes of the US had changed
since the last Democratic president, Johnson, had
launched his Great Society with the grand vision of
abolishing poverty in America. Carter did not havean easy time before him.Carter was the first president since the civil war to come from the South. He was also a
Washington outsider, and owed his electoralvictory partly to this fact. The credibility of gov-ernment had fallen, and the American people
were looking for a change from the old gang.
Ford was intelligent and his integrity was above
reproach, but the pardon he gave to Nixon haddamaged him badly, though seen in longer per-spective it was both in the national interest and a
courageous step in the face of public feeling at
the time. Ford lacked charisma, though, and a
good tele-image. Carter also lacked a command-
ing presence, but his warm, folksy manner andbroad grin won him friends. He was patentlyhonest, untouched by sordid Washington politics
or past scandals. Even so, the margin of electoral
votes that carried him to the White House was
small; his strength in the south and north-eastcarried the day, but he was weak in the west andso lacked a broad national base of support.Carter was determined to emphasise that hispresidency would represent a break with the past,
especially with Nixon’s ‘imperial presidency’. He
would be the people’s president, a trustee fortheir needs, concerned with the wider nationalinterest. This implied not a weak presidency but
strong leadership, ‘doing what’s right, not what’s
political’. He saw himself as above party politics,
acting differently from Congress, whose senatorsand representatives were actuated by politicalconsiderations, having to bear in mind the special
interests of their constituents and their ﬁnancial
backers, and having to keep a constant eye on re-election. Although Carter had comfortablemajorities in both Houses, this did not meanautomatic support for all that he wished to
accomplish. He avoided any distinctive label: he
was liberal in some aspects of policy and conser-
vative in others.After so much turmoil and change, Carter sawa need for consolidation at home, efﬁciency and
honesty in government, a pruning of wasteful
welfare programmes, a reduction in government
interference and a lightening of the regulations
imposed on business and industry. Americanpolitics do not neatly divide between one partyright of centre in its outlook and the other to the
liberal left of centre. Rather, the more conserva-
tive and the more liberal social policies cut
through each party. Trusteeship for Carter meanta careful husbandry of the money demanded intaxation. Sound government ﬁnance required the
balancing of the budget, not spending more than
the money in the coffers. Carter hoped to reduce
armaments and military expenditure. But he wasalso sensitive to immediate needs, especially thescourge of unemployment. To stimulate the
economy and reduce unemployment he adopted
a Keynesian approach, sending to Congress a
moderate tax-cutting bill and making federal
grants to create jobs. Congress changed the pro-posals in detail but approved of the general thrust.During the later years of his presidency, Carterbecame more cautious, avoiding any costly reshap-
ing of welfare as he became more concerned about
inﬂation and a rising federal deﬁcit. The 1970s,after the shock of the oil-price rise of 1973–4,were a difﬁcult period of economic management
throughout the Western world, and of course
throughout the Third World. Governments are
lucky or unlucky when it comes to world eco-
nomic conditions and the business cycle, overwhich they have very little control. But they getthe blame when unemployment rises and living
standards fall. Carter in 1978 fell back on the 
old remedies of regulation, limiting the salary
increases of federal employees and setting volun-tary – and ineffective – guidelines on wages andprices. The classic remedy for inﬂation of raising
interest rates was also employed. There was a 
coal strike and Carter invoked the anti-union794THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
Taft–Hartley Act. Other federal regulatory meas-ures were passed that protected the environmentin Alaska and limited the damage done to the land
by strip-mining.Carter did not achieve anything like all thereforms he had hoped for during his presidency.He would have had better relations with Con-gress had he employed a less high moral tone 
and more ﬂexibility. His White House staff, also
Georgian outsiders, lacked the necessary experi-
ence to handle Congress more skilfully. They
were surprised by how long it took for the legis-lative process to be completed; they sent manymeasures to Congress without having established
a clear idea of their priorities. A centrepiece of
Carter’s endeavours in the wake of the oil-price
rise of 1973–4 was to cut down on the extrava-gantly wasteful use of energy in the US. But hisenergy plan ran into opposition from many inter-
est groups. For the average American, freedom is
a car and cheap gasoline. After more than a year
of wrangling, a watered-down National EnergyAct became law in the autumn of 1978.In the relations of the US with the rest ofworld, Carter was determined to strike a new
note. He wanted to reduce tensions, especially
with the Soviet Union, but was also determined
to stand up for human rights, ‘the soul of ourforeign policy’. He promised to be positive, togive as much attention to relations with the poor
Third World as to East–West relations. In June
1979, SALT II was concluded with the USSR, by
which the superpowers accepted a balance ofnuclear missile capacity between them. Althoughbitterly criticised it left each side with far more
warheads and missiles than would be needed to
turn any nuclear war into a holocaust. MAD
(mutual assured destruction) remained intact as
the doctrine of the day. This required that someUS missiles should survive any first strike. Inpursuit of this doctrine, a number of crazy
schemes were devised, but in the end none was
adopted. At the heart of the administration, there
was a conﬂict between the policies advocated byCarter’s aggressive National Security AdviserZbigniew Brzezinski and the more conciliatory
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, with the State
Department supported by the military.In Latin America the perceived need tocombat communism led to a drift of policy, butthe Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, by which the
US agreed the eventual transfer of sovereignty
over the Canal Zone to Panama, was one of the
clear successes of the Carter foreign policy. Butuncertainty was evident in the administration’sdealings with the revolution in Nicaragua.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in Decem-ber 1979 reinvigorated the Cold War. The Carter
administration was particularly alarmed by the
strategic threat now presented to the Gulf and itsoil and warned the Soviet Union off in forthrightterms, Carter declaring that an attempt by any outside force to gain control ofthe Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an1THE UNITED STATES795

military force.What made the situation doubly grave were theupheavals in Iran.The conduct of US policy in the Middle Eastearned for Carter both the biggest praise and the
most severe condemnation. For thirteen days he
tirelessly laboured at Camp David in September
1978, and the Accords reached there betweenMenachem Begin and Anwar Sadat had laid a ﬁrmbasis for peace between Israel and Egypt.In Iran, Carter had continued the US policyof unconditional support for the Shah despite his
human-rights abuses. Until late in 1979, giventhe support of the army he had modernised, theShah was believed safe, the ally of the US and
policeman of the Gulf. But it appears that the
administration was badly served by the advice it
received from intelligence sources and diplomats.Assessment of the Shah’s chances of survival wasnot made until the autumn of 1978. In January
1979 he ﬂed the country. The fanatical new rulers
of Iran, who gained power the following month,
condemned the US as the ‘Great Satan’, and the
moderates lost control. When the terminally sickShah was admitted to the US for medical treat-ment in October 1979, the radicals in Teheran
used it as a pretext to escalate their attacks on the
US. Demanding that the Shah be returned 
to stand trial, they seized the US Embassy thatsame month and took hostage the sixty-threeAmericans they found there. The hostage crisis
overshadowed Carter’s last year in the White
House. He opposed using force, fearing that thehostages’ lives would be in danger. Instead heimposed economic sanctions, froze all Iranianassets in the US and broke off diplomatic rela-
tions in April 1980. Later that same month he
approved a mission to rescue the hostages by air-
craft and a specially trained task force. It wenttragically wrong. Eight men of the rescue missionwere left dead in the desert for the Iranians to
gloat over. It was a profound humiliation and
contributed to Carter’s loss of the presidential
election in November, although the hostages’
release was negotiated later by the administration.Spitefully, they were not allowed to leave by airfrom Iran until half an hour after the inaugura-
tion of Ronald Reagan on 20 January 1981.The Carter administration had ended with aperiod of inﬂation and economic troubles in thewake of the second oil-price rise in 1979–80.Carter looked like a perpetual loser. The energy
crisis was only temporary, but somehow the 
president became fixated on it. Congress was
proving recalcitrant, so Carter addressed theAmerican people on nationwide television in July1979, claiming that ‘energy will be the immedi-
ate test of our ability to unite this nation’. It was
an extraordinary exaggeration. In what became
known as the ‘crisis of conﬁdence’ speech, he
attacked Congress and painted a dire picture ofthe future. The problems of America, he claimed,had their origins in a ‘crisis of conﬁdence’. Ronald
Reagan, by contrast, was upbeat and optimistic.
He promised a new beginning, an America that
would ‘stand tall’; he appealed for a renewal ofpatriotism, a new beginning. Many Americans didnot bother to vote in the presidential election in
November 1980, but those who did gave Reagan
a decisive majority over the luckless Carter.796THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
The changes that took place in the Soviet Unionafter Mikhail Gorbachev succeeded to the posi-
tion of general secretary of the Communist Party
and to the leadership of the country in 1985astonished the world. Gorbachev set a new agenda for relations with the Warsaw Pact allies
and allowed Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria,
Romania and Hungary to choose their own inter-
nal and external relations. It was the end of com-
munist one-party states, so jealously defended by Big Brother for four decades. Even more astonishingly Gorbachev laid to rest the ghost 
of a revanchist Germany and allowed the East
Germans to choose uniﬁcation with the West. His
policies went a long way to dispelling Westernfears of the Soviet Union. Disarmament lay at theheart of the Kremlin’s new policies. ‘Gorby’ was
welcomed and applauded in the streets of Bonn
and amid the skyscrapers of New York. People in
the West pressured their governments to respond
more quickly and warmly to the Soviet leader’soffer of disarmament and peace, and Gorbachev’sgenuine desire to end the Cold War ﬁnally over-
came Western suspicions. The Warsaw Pact was
dissolved and a united Germany joined NATO.
The Cold War ended in 1991 and the SovietUnion and the US began working towards com-mon aims in the Middle East, Asia and Europe.Gorbachev outlined his ideas for radicalchange in his book Perestroika, published in 1987as a paperback all over the world, its subtitle NewThinking for Our Country and the World. In it,Gorbachev explains his aims to ‘restructure’ andreform Soviet society, to rekindle the initiative
and personal responsibility of every Soviet citizen.
Corruption and inefﬁciency would be ended, thefalsehood that cloaked the oppression of thepeople – who were ‘guaranteed’ constitutional
freedoms that existed only on paper – would be
purged. The twin of perestroikaor ‘restructuring’was glasnostor ‘openness’. ‘Restructuring’ and‘openness’ were mild words for Gorbachev’sobjectives which, in the context of Soviet history,were truly revolutionary. The people would be
granted genuine legal freedoms and the right to
criticise, to express their views, to choose on merit
(by exercising their votes) between rival candi-dates for important political functions. DidGorbachev indeed intend ﬁnally to rid the Soviet
Union of the ideology of the Russian Revolution
and all its works?A careful reading of Perestroikareveals theschism in Gorbachev’s thinking which was therefrom the start. He was not a democrat in theWestern sense or a convert to the view that cap-
italism would rescue the Soviet Union from its
economic backwardness. He was a socialist
reformer, inspired by beliefs that were in line withWestern idealism, that is beliefs in individual civicrights and freedoms, and he exerted all his power
and employed all his talents to allow the Soviet
people to gain them for the ﬁrst time in Soviet
history. The distinguished dissidents AnatolySharansky and Andrei Sakharov were released,1Chapter 69THE SOVIET UNION, CRISIS AND REFORMGORBACHEV, YELTSIN AND PUTIN
from prison and from exile, respectively, in 1986.But he also rejected capitalism. ‘Capitalism’, hedeclared in a speech in February 1986, ‘regarded
the birth of socialism as an error of history which
had to be corrected at any cost by any means.’
Perestroika, he wrote, did not signify a ‘disen-chantment with socialism’, and was not motivatedby a ‘crisis for its ideals and ultimate goals.
Nothing could be further from the truth than
such interpretations’.In the Soviet Union’s internal and externalpolicies much needed to be changed and im-proved. But Gorbachev was not about to lead theSoviet Union on the path that Czechoslovakia or
Poland were following. The Czechs and Poles saw
as their model the Western parliamentary multi-
party system, together with a market economydominated by private ownership of land andindustry. Gorbachev rejected ‘bourgeois capital-
ism’. The Soviet Union’s socialist ideals were not
to be called into question, nor was the essential
cohesion of the USSR. For all his radicalism,Gorbachev intended to place limits on ‘new polit-ical thinking’.But was the Soviet economy reformable if itclung to what Gorbachev regarded as unchal-

lengeable – socialism? Zbigniew Brzezinski, once
President Carter’s national security adviser, wrotea remarkable book just before the revolutionaryupheavals in central and Eastern Europe entitled
The Grand Failure: The Birth and Death of
Communism in the Twentieth Centuryin which heforecast the end of communism. Gorbachevagreed with Brzezinski on the wasted years, onthe lack of productivity of Soviet labour and on
the inefﬁcient use of resources, but for Gorbachev
these spelt not the death of communism but the
need for renewal, for perestroikaand glasnostasthe engines of change. Communism had simplynot reached its full potential. This faith preventedGorbachev from seeking to reform the Soviet
economy and its politics as fundamentally as he
transformed the Soviet Union’s external relation-
ships. Internally, his policies revealed hesitationsand ambiguities as the economy shuddered frombad to worse.In the towns, queues for essential foodstuffsand goods lengthened, the black market and ‘freemarket’ ﬂourished, and it became difﬁcult to dis-tinguish between the two. The reform of theparty and its corrupt bosses had the side-effect of
loosening discipline; glasnosthad gone beyondhealthy criticism to challenge the fundamentals of
the Soviet state. Each of the republics becamedetermined to do what was best for itself, andethnic strife undermined the cohesion of the
Union. Better economic conditions and a clearer
policy that delivered results might have held the
Soviet people together in the absence of repres-
sive force. But worsening conditions fuelled strife,and nationalism is such a primitive and powerfulforce that its repression for decades had left it
ready to explode.In 1985 as Gorbachev began his enormoustask of radically changing the Soviet Union hewas supported by a reformist minority in theparty, but he also faced a majority in key positions
who, though persuaded of the need for some
change, were not ready for a revolution entailing
the loss of their powers and privileges. Gorbachevtherefore had to work against the prevailing sen-timent of the majority. He improvised with dex-
terity until the juggling came to grief. He
outmanoeuvred his opponents and displayed daz-
zling political skills as he altered party and state
structures, changed their names and their func-tions, introduced new electoral procedures andcreated new bodies. All in all, it was a virtuoso
performance. It left the Soviet people breathless
but in the end disillusioned as standards of living
dropped precipitously after 1987. To underlinethe extent of his accomplishment, it may behelpful brieﬂy to examine the structures of state
and party inherited by Gorbachev.Though the different party bodies were sup-posed to be chosen democratically from the grass
roots upwards, the reverse was true; they wereappointed from the top down, except for theleading position of the general secretary of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union, who was
chosen from among the Politburo members,
though formally the Politburo recommended andthe Central Committee approved. Gorbachev was‘approved’ on 11 March 1985. The Politburo
consisted of ten full and six candidate members
who in theory were ‘elected’ by the Central798THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
Committee of 319 full and 151 candidate mem-bers meeting normally every six months. TheCentral Committee also ‘elected’ the Secretariat,
whose head was the second secretary, deputy to
the general secretary. The Secretariat of eleven
members controlled twenty departments whichsupervised 109 government ministries. A networkof republican, regional, city, town and district
committees spanned the Soviet Union, depend-
ent on the Central Committee’s Secretariat
bureaucracy of some 3,000 employees.It is important to note that until 1985 theparty supervised the ministries, which were alsoresponsible to a prime minister and government
ministers. Thus there was dual control of min-
istries by the government and the party, suppos-
edly coordinated by the general secretary. Thegeneral secretary was also chairman of the USSRparliament, the USSR Supreme Soviet, which was
little more than a ceremonial body, listening
annually to the general secretary and dutifully
applauding all he said. Carbon-copy supremesoviets and soviets fanned out in republics, cities,towns and districts.This structure was supplemented by other bod-ies. At irregular occasions a conference of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union could be
called; the eighteenth such conference had beenconvened in 1941; Gorbachev used the nine-
teenth, called in 1988, to make far-reaching
changes to party structures. Finally, it was also
possible to call a congress of the CPSU, which also
met irregularly when the general secretary wishedto call one. Gorbachev used two such congresses,the twenty-seventh in 1986 and the twenty-eighth
in 1990, as springboards for his reforms.During his first years of power, Gorbachevencouraged pressure from below to win support
for his reforms and to overcome party inertia andopposition. But here he trod a thin line betweenthe imperatives of keeping popular protest under
control and of reassuring the party leadership that
he was not dismantling the Soviet communist
system. Economic change necessitated a reform ofthe party itself, a reform of the old power struc-tures, the KGB, the army and the nomenklatura– the nomenklaturabeing the means by which theparty elite controlled the key positions in theadministration, the judiciary, industry, agricultureand education.Gorbachev’s major effort at ‘democratic’ re-form was to inject some grass-roots participation
in the ﬁlling of the lower nomenklaturavacancies.This is what he meant by the democratisation ofthe Soviet state. But from the start it was ques-tionable whether the party could ever regain the
respect of the people, having for decades been a
virtually autonomous self-appointed group within
the state whose senior functionaries enjoyed many
privileges denied to the rest.During Gorbachev’s ﬁrst ﬁve years a plethoraof meetings, conferences and congresses took
place, their open debates televised for the Russian
people in an unprecedented attempt to mobilise
and educate public opinion. Gorbachev set thepace in speeches that were widely reported in1985. In the Central Committee, which had
endorsed him as general secretary, he had to
move cautiously: it was crucial for him to build
up support there and in the Politburo. In his ﬁrstyear he replaced two-thirds of the key leaders atthe top and continued to make changes in later
years. But this did not remove all opposition to
his views, as the dramatic events of August 1991
were to show. At the April 1985 meeting of the
Central Committee, the blueprint of perestroikawas agreed and some practical reforms under-
taken. In an attempt to make the central min-
istries more efficient, rival departments were
eliminated: in agriculture six separate ministries
were combined into one super-ministry with20,000 staff cuts; two other super-ministries werecreated in the key areas of machine-building and
computers. Unfortunately the ministries them-
selves were equipped with computers whose input
and output remained ﬂawed – they could not
cope with the complexities of the economy.On 25 February 1986, the Twenty-SeventhCongress of the Communist Party opened in
Moscow. The streets were festooned with slogans,
‘The Party and the People Are One’, which was
certainly not true. After its ten-day session theCongress accepted Gorbachev’s blueprint for half-hearted reform of the socialist economy, but 
concrete reforms of the party were largely
blocked. Another failure was an attempt to revive1THE SOVIET UNION, CRISIS AND REFORM799
Khrushchev’s rule that no party ofﬁcial could servemore than ﬁfteen years and that one-third of themembers on all committees had to change every
ﬁve years. This meant that the majority of the
long-serving party ofﬁcials of the Brezhnev era
would remain in place, but their privileges werereduced over the next three years, they becamemore accountable above and below, and corrupt
practices became more dangerous. Millions of
party workers thus felt nothing for Gorbachev’s
reforms but resentment and had little personal
interest in lifting a ﬁnger to further them.In April 1986, soon after the Twenty-SeventhCongress, disaster struck the Soviet Union: an
explosion took place within the nuclear reactor at
Chernobyl. The Ukraine was severely affected by
radiation: hundreds were killed, the health ofthousands more was affected for years to come,and the rich farming land was severely polluted.
Moreover, the damage was a major setback for
the Soviet economy. Where was glasnostthen, asGorbachev and the Kremlin hesitated for daysbefore revealing the truth about the nuclear fall-out spreading through Scandinavia to Western
Europe? The successor republics of the Soviet
Union have many nuclear reactors built to the
same design which they cannot do without. They
remain potential time-bombs.Yet Gorbachev showed himself to be a very dif-ferent leader from his predecessors. There was a
new openness and humanity, and an air of excite-
ment about changes to come, but little was actu-
ally achieved in 1985 and 1986 to improve the lifeof the average Soviet citizen. The Gorbachevmedia image promised much but there was a dan-
ger that expectations would soon outrun perfor-
mance. Even so, there were real signs of change.
Glasnostwas ending the persecution of human-rights activists, most notably of Sakharov, releasedfrom his Siberian exile in December 1986. A newforeign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, was
appointed in July 1985, when the old Cold War
warrior Andrei Gromyko was replaced and kicked
upstairs into a ceremonial presidency. In October1986 the general secretary met Reagan at theReykjavik summit and proposed complete nuclear
disarmament; this breathtaking suggestion came
to nothing because Reagan would not acceptGorbachev’s condition of conﬁning the US ‘StarWars’ Strategic Defence Initiative to the labora-tory. Yet it proved not the end of detente but the
beginning.As Gorbachev was breaking new ground athome and abroad, he also faced ﬁerce resistance
from two, opposed, sides. Yegor Ligachev, thepowerful second secretary of the party, voiced 
misgivings about the direction of reform. For Boris
Yeltsin, Moscow’s active party chief and a member
of the Politburo, Gorbachev’s economic and polit-

ical reforms were far too hesitant. Yeltsin (a formerLigachev protégé before being taken up byGorbachev) and Ligachev clashed bitterly in the
Politburo. Ligachev was determined to destroy the
political influence of the now radical Moscow
leader, who had been denouncing party privileges,corruption and even what he called the new personality cult of the general secretary. In the
Central Committee Yeltsin forced a showdown,
announcing at its meeting in October 1987 his
intention to resign from the Politburo. Gorbachevwas furious. The outward appearance of unity ofthe Central Committee had been broken on the
eve of the annual November celebration of the
Russian Revolution. Yeltsin, a sick man at the time,
probably suffering from heart trouble, was obliged
to go into hospital. The streak of ruthlessness inGorbachev is revealed by what happened next.Yeltsin was forced to leave hospital to attend a
meeting of the Moscow party committee; he was
humiliated and sacked. It was Ligachev’s revenge
and triumph. But Yeltsin’s disgrace also marks thebeginning of the bitter rivalry, personal and polit-
ical, that set Yeltsin against Gorbachev. For the
time being Yeltsin was cast into the political
wilderness. His re-emergence was to change the
course of Soviet history.In 1987 Gorbachev felt secure enough tobegin to push through startling political andstructural changes to the party and the state. In
January, he proposed to the Central Committee
that deputies should not simply be appointed to
local regional and republican soviets by the partyapparat– the people should participate andshould be allowed a genuine choice of candidates.
What was more, the deputies need not be party
hacks but could be professionals, and they should800THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
be chosen by the people in a secret ballot. It wasnot democracy yet, for the candidates would allbe vetted and had to be approved by an ofﬁcial
selection committee, but for the Soviet Union it
was a vital break with the past. Similar elections
were to be held in factories to select managers.Gorbachev also proposed the holding of another,the nineteenth, national party conference.The year 1987 also witnessed cautious initia-tives in the ﬁeld of economic reform. Gorbachev
contemplated some form of leasehold of agricul-
tural land. Small private businesses were allowedto start; a few individuals became wealthy. Thefree-enterprise cooperative movement grew from
small beginnings to 133,000 concerns in 1989,
employing 3 million people, but they were con-
strained from developing fully. The state, directlyor indirectly, was still the employer of the over-whelming mass of the Soviet peoples, and it was
still the most important customer. Attempts to
make the state sector of the economy more efﬁ-
cient by such measures as the Law of StateEnterprises in June 1987, which removed thedetailed control of central planners, ended in dis-
aster. Reform was slow and half-hearted. Prices
were not set by the market and the consumer but
by the state planners. Genuine cost accounting
was lacking. This, coupled with less draconianparty control, threatened the economy with theworst of both worlds: it was no longer compre-
hensively planned nor was it a market economy.The government continued to print money toease workers’ discontent and so, with too manyroubles chasing too few goods, produced sky-high prices on the black and free markets; mean-
while, deliveries at state prices were diminishing,
as the goods were illegally diverted to the more
proﬁtable free market. Resistance to more funda-
mental and rapid reform was strong. The radicalreformers and economists such as Yeltsin werelocked in battle with the conservatives and reac-
tionaries. Gorbachev now inclined to caution.Another serious problem was surfacing in 1987– nationalist and ethnic unrest in the republics.In August that year there were large-scale demon-strations in the Baltic republics, Lithuania, Latvia
and Estonia, which had been annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940 after a pact concluded withHitler. In the following year the demand forautonomy grew stronger. The Estonian parlia-ment claimed the right to veto laws passed by 
the Supreme Soviet on national issues. In the
Caucasus the Christian Armenians of Nagorno-
Karabakh became embroiled in internecine con-ﬂict with Muslim Azerbaijan, in whose republicthey formed an enclave; demonstrations followed
and blood was shed. The troubles spread to the
republic of Armenia, and Moscow ceased to be
fully in control. The ethnic conﬂicts presented a
serious threat to Gorbachev’s reforms becausethey were likely to provoke a conservative back-lash against the greater freedom from central party
control which lay at the heart of his perestroika;he told the Armenians they were stabbing him in
the back. He also recognised that to reopen nowthe question of frontiers between the republicsthreatened unstoppable conﬂict. He was there-
fore unsympathetic to the nationalist agitation,
whether it arose in the Caucasus or in the Baltic.Gorbachev achieved a major internationalsuccess in 1987. After the Reykjavik failure, nego-tiations between Washington and Moscow con-
tinued. By the close of the year agreement was
reached on getting rid of two whole classes of
nuclear missiles, those of intermediate and short
range. A treaty recording their agreement in prin-ciple was signed in Washington by Reagan andGorbachev. It was an important moment: conﬁ-
dence was being built up.The Nineteenth Party Conference, summonedby Gorbachev, brought on 28 June 1988 toMoscow from all over the country 5,000 partymembers, most of them conservatives. Despite all
the efforts of the Communist Party organisation, a
minority of radicals had made it too. Among them
was Boris Yeltsin, who secured his election in
Karelia. Nor had the elections of delegates every-
where been the tame pre-ordained affairs of thepast. There were public demonstrations in a num-

ber of cities against the party’s tactics – that in
Moscow’s Pushkin Square attracted worldwide
attention. Radicals within the party had formed theDemocratic Union, whose objective was to createa multi-party democratic parliamentary system.
Many of these were among the 2,000 people who
had gathered in Pushkin Square. Heavy-handed1THE SOVIET UNION, CRISIS AND REFORM801
police attempts to remove the most militantdemonstrators were caught by the television cam-
eras, as was the crowd’s courageous insistence on
what were supposed to be guaranteed legal rights.Gorbachev presided over the Conference,doing his best to appear even-handed betweenthe large majority of communist conservatives andpassive middle-of-the-roaders, on the one hand,
and the small group of radicals, whose undoubted
star was Yeltsin, on the other. Gorbachev now
unfolded his radical reform plans for the party.
The party Secretariat would no longer supervisegovernment ministries; in this way party and statewould be separated. The Supreme Soviet would
be abolished, to be replaced by a Congress of
People’s Deputies. Two-thirds of its members
would be elected from a list of candidates ap-proved by electoral committees; one-third were to be nominated – 100 by the Communist Party,
the remainder by a variety of social organisations
ranging from the Academy of Sciences, which was
allocated twenty seats, to the Society of StampCollectors and the Red Cross. It was a huge bodyof 2,250 members. Its main function besides lis-
tening to speeches during its meetings (over just
two or three days a year) was to elect a (new)
Supreme Soviet of 400 to 450 members, chosen
from the deputies – a working parliament insession for some eight months a year. The headof state, responsible for the government, foreign
policy and defence, as well as for the party, 
would be the chairman of the Supreme Soviet.
Gorbachev persuaded the party conference toapprove his plans, which enabled these constitu-tional reforms to be implemented in time for the
Congress of People’s Deputies to be elected in
the spring of 1989.The proceedings of the Conference were tele-
vised, providing a dramatic illustration of thedebate that Gorbachev’s democratisation wasencouraging in the Soviet Union. It was a specta-

cle unprecedented in Soviet history. Most notable
was the last day of the conference, when the bulky
ﬁgure of Boris Yeltsin insisted on being heard fromthe rostrum. Gorbachev, presiding, could haveprevented him from speaking, but he chose not to.
Yeltsin argued for faster democratic progress, gen-

uine elections and the prosecution of corruptCommunist Party bosses, the ‘millionaire bribe-takers’. Perestroika, he advocated, should firstachieve success in one or two essential areas before
it was extended to others; the people, he said, were
losing faith, dismayed by the lack of progress.
Ligachev, the arch-conservative, rebutted Yeltsin’sarguments and tried to ridicule him. He alsodenied, unconvincingly, that the party bosses
enjoyed unwarranted luxuries. But the Soviet
peoples listening to the debate throughout the
USSR knew who was telling the truth. Through
the power of the media and by his courageous confrontation Boris Yeltsin had again catapultedhimself to national attention as the ‘alternative’
reformer to Gorbachev, and his following grew. At
its close the Conference tamely approved Gorba-

chev’s constitutional proposals as the lesser of theevils presented to them. Obedience to the generalsecretary’s will was still the norm. The habits of
dictatorship served Gorbachev the reformer.‘Democratisation’ was, for Gorbachev, creat-ing not just a conﬂict between the communistconservatives like Ligachev, who feared that theparty would lose control of the country, and the
radicals, who accused Gorbachev of wishing to
stop at a halfway stage between the old party
system and genuine democracy.Gorbachev’s reforms were also creating a clashwith independent republics opposed to theKremlin’s central domination of the Union. In
the Baltic republics this independence movement
had rapidly gathered strength. The anniversary of
the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, whichhad delivered the three Baltic republics, Latvia,Estonia and Lithuania, into the Soviet sphere,
prior to their absorption in 1940 and 1941 into
the Soviet Union, became the occasion for
denunciation. A human chain linked the three
republics in a spectacular demonstration of soli-darity. Popular fronts were formed between independent-minded communists and nationalists
in the three states, the most forceful being the
Lithuanian Sajudis. Tentative declarations of sov-
ereignty in all three countries were condemned byGorbachev as ‘nationalist excesses’. Relationsbetween the Baltic representatives and Moscow
continued to deteriorate throughout the year.
Gorbachev believed that he could not give way802THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
without raising similar claims in the Union’s otherrepublics. He would go no further than holdingout a promise of a measure of economic auton-
omy, but this did not satisfy the nationalists.Nationalism was not conﬁned to the Baltics. In
the Caucasus the conﬂict over Nagorno-Karabakh
continued unabated, with Moscow’s mediation orthreats of force settling nothing. Gorbachev’s insti-

tutional changes also alarmed the people of
Georgia, who feared that they would strengthen
the centre at the expense of the republics. In
November 1988 there had been demonstrations inTblisi, the capital of Georgia. The inefﬁciency of
the assistance rushed to the victims of a huge earth-

quake in Armenia in December 1988 again
reﬂected badly on the Kremlin’s powers in general
and on Gorbachev in particular. Much worse fol-
lowed. In April 1989 there was another peacefuldemonstration in Tblisi. Gorbachev was out of 
the country. The Georgian communist leader
appealed to the Kremlin for support and the hard-

liners led by Ligachev ordered troop reinforce-
ments. Gorbachev returned, expecting a peacefuloutcome. Instead the troops went into action, 
ﬁring on the crowd and using gas to disperse them.
The Tblisi ‘massacre’ left twenty dead and hun-

dreds more injured. The brutality tarnished
Gorbachev’s image on the eve of the ﬁrst meeting
of the Congress of People’s Deputies in May 1989.The elections, conducted over several weeks,had been chaotic. The party had done its best to
inﬂuence the outcome, but a sizeable group of
radicals was returned. Public pressure nowcounted for something, especially in the largecities. The attempt to exclude Andrei Sakharov,
the most famous of the human-rights dissidents,
backﬁred on the Academy of Sciences and he was
elected. But the most spectacular victory was that
of Boris Yeltsin in the Moscow constituency,where he defeated the party apparatchikby alandslide. With 5 million Moscow votes cast for
him, Yeltsin could now claim some democratic
credibility, in contrast to Gorbachev, who had
never submitted himself to any popular election.The ﬁrst session of the Congress of People’sDeputies began on 25 May 1989. The lack of
respect shown for key leaders of the old regime
and the reluctance of large numbers of deputiesto conform to rules were a tribute to the atmos-phere of freedom and the absence of fear thatGorbachev had done so much to bring about.
Gorbachev himself had a tough time controlling
the proceedings, which were televised in the spirit
of glasnost. Remarkably Andrei Sakharov gave hissupport to the proposition that Gorbachev beelected president of the Supreme Soviet, the
smaller working parliament that was to be chosen
from among the deputies. He admired the man
but had reservations about the pace of reform.
The majority of the deputies were silent con-
formists, but active radicals and militant conser-vatives, plus some individual eccentrics, ensured
a lively forum with many speeches on many sub-
jects, and Gorbachev and his ministers heard many
of their policies challenged. When it came to elect-ing the Supreme Soviet, the majority voted inparty conservatives, mainly nonentities. Yeltsin
and other radicals were left out. The people of
Moscow mounted a large demonstration against
the exclusion of their hero. The democratic spirithad been truly awakened and could no longer besmothered by old-style KGB and police repres-
sion. Even the conservatives now understood this
and amended the laws accordingly.Could the peoples of the Soviet Union begranted fewer political freedoms than their alliesand neighbours in the people’s republics? Eco-nomic crisis at home was hastening Soviet disen-

gagement from what had once been satellites, 
in Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Czecho-

slovakia and the German Democratic Republic.From the spring of 1989 to the end of the yearcommunist rulers, no longer protected by the Red
Army, were being overthrown one after the other
by popular revolutionary movements. These asser-

tions of independence could not fail to make an
impact in the Soviet republics. Why should com-
munism survive in the Soviet Union when it wasbeing rejected by people everywhere else? Even
China could not entirely isolate itself from this
world revolutionary movement. In the Soviet
Union improving economic conditions might havereconciled the people a little longer to the reformof communism that Gorbachev was striving to
bring about. But material conditions were con-

stantly getting worse. A massive strike by miners in1THE SOVIET UNION, CRISIS AND REFORM803
the summer of 1989 was settled only by giving into all the miners’ demands, though the promisesmade could not all be kept.Gorbachev believed there was only oneanswer: to push on with his political and institu-
tional reforms. He thought he could counteractthe increasing dangers of a breakdown by gath-ering more and more power to himself. He had
no intention of becoming an autocrat, except in
the sense of seeing democratic reforms through
to their successful conclusion. At the same time
he was afraid to introduce radical economic reme-dies which would raise prices and create millionsof unemployed. The people’s anger might then
sweep away perestroikaand glasnostand his ownhumane programme.At the second session of the Congress ofPeople’s Deputies in December 1989 democraticelections took another step forward with the abo-
lition of seats reserved for the Communist Party
and communist-dominated ‘social organisations’.
During the spring session of 1990, the govern-ment of the Soviet Union was reshaped oncemore, giving even greater powers to Gorbachev.
He was elected president of the Soviet Union on
15 March 1990. The president’s executive func-
tions were supported by two councils, a presiden-
tial council of his personal advisers and ministersand a federative council of representatives fromthe ﬁfteen republics; the two councils would often
meet together. These new structures completely
marginalised the old party centres of power, the
Politburo (renamed Praesidium) and the CentralCommittee. Even the ‘leading role’ of theCommunist Party, enshrined in Article 6 of the
constitution, came under such heavy attack that it
had to be abandoned, and the Soviet Union
seemed on the threshold of permitting multi-party
elections. Yet for Gorbachev the preservation ofthe Communist Party, as the one cohesive elementbinding the Union together, remained a crucial
objective. If this could no longer be achieved by
constitutional law, as he had hoped it could be,
then a reformed party would have to win theapproval of the people in a contest with others.Gorbachev remained by conviction a communist,
albeit a new type of ‘humane communist’. But the
tide of history was against him.The first of the real crisis years was 1990.Paradoxically the more constitutional powerGorbachev acquired, the weaker in reality he
became. Under the immense strains that the great
drama was imposing on him, Gorbachev was tir-

ing; at times he seemed to lose heart and offered toresign. But there was no one among the conserva-
tive majority in the party ready to replace him, and
the radicals like Yeltsin were anathema to that
majority. The nationalist problems also kept
mounting. Gorbachev turned to strong-arm tactics
to regain control and to preserve the Union. InJanuary a massacre of Armenians by Azeri in Bakuled to a showdown, with Red Army units ‘retaking’
Baku on Gorbachev’s orders. The president then
visited Lithuania, where he met general hostility.
The democratising movement he had set inmotion during the spring of 1990 now led to elec-
tions for new parliaments in each of the republics,
elections which enormously strengthened the
nationalists. The Popular Front in Lithuania swept
the board and on 11 March 1990 the LithuanianParliament declared the country’s independence,appointing Vytantas Landsbergis president. The
declaration was declared invalid in Moscow, and
Soviet tanks and paratroopers appeared in the
streets of Vilnius in a vain attempt to overawe the
population. Gorbachev next instituted an eco-
nomic blockade, then made conciliatory gestures.But Estonia and Latvia followed Lithuania’s lead
during the course of the year. By the end of 1990
negotiations between the Baltic representa-
tives and Gorbachev had reached stalemate. TheWestern powers hesitated to support the Balticmoves for independence because they still relied on
Gorbachev in international affairs and wished to do
nothing to weaken him. But on the economic side
the West did little to strengthen him, having no
conﬁdence that the economic reforms were goingfar enough.The largest of the Soviet Union’s republics wasthe Russian Federation, which contained about
half the Soviet Union’s population and three-
quarters of its territory. The elections in the citieshad returned radical deputies, though the country-
side was still traditional. Moscow’s new mayor 
was the radical Gavriil Popov, and St Petersburg’s
(the rechristened Leningrad) mayor was another804THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
democrat, Anatoly Sobchak. The Federation’s newparliament appeared to be fairly evenly splitbetween conservatives and radicals. Boris Yeltsin,
the obvious leader of the radicals, now campaigned
for the presidency of parliament, which would
make him practically leader of the republic. Hemade his aim clear: to gain independence for theRussian Federation without leaving the Soviet
Union. The powers to be delegated to the 
Union would become a matter for negotiation.
Gorbachev supported a conservative candidate,
but Yeltsin won the vote by a comfortable major-
ity. He now emerged as a powerful national leader.There were deep policy differences betweenYeltsin and Gorbachev, not least on the best way to
handle the nationality conﬂicts. Yeltsin believed

that the republics could be associated only in a vol-
untary union, preserving independence but hand-
ing some joint responsibilities to the Soviet Union.
If any wished to leave the Soviet Union altogether,
as the Baltic republics did, no obstacles should be
placed in their way. He accordingly arranged forthe Russian Federation to sign separate agreementswith the Baltic republics. This went too far for
Gorbachev, who saw a purely voluntary association
as a recipe for disintegration and chaos. On the
issue of democratisation, Yeltsin was totally disen-

chanted with the Communist Party and did notwish to see it enjoy any special position in theSoviet Union. For Gorbachev it remained the
backbone of unity and the only possible adminis-

trative tool of reform. There was also the ques-
tion of how to modernise the Soviet economy.Gorbachev hankered after some socialist halfway-house. Yeltsin saw no alternative but a rapid trans-

formation to a market economy at whatever cost in
terms of immediate hardship to the Russian
people.The only hope for the Soviet Union in 1990seemed to be for the old rivals Yeltsin andGorbachev to work together, and both expressed
their willingness to try. At the meeting of the
Twenty-Eighth Congress of the Communist Party
in July 1990, Gorbachev delivered an address out-
lining his vision of a truly free society founded ona respect for human rights. He went further than
ever before in deﬁning democratisation as involv-

ing free elections and a multi-party system. Hedefended perestroikaand denied that it was respon-
sible for the lamentable condition of the Sovieteconomy – yet he had little but words to offer as
remedies. He was strong on freedom, on political
and party reform, weak and cautious on how best
to tackle the crisis in the economy. He was bitterlyattacked by Ligachev and the majority of the conservatives. Yeltsin, with an eye, as always, for
the dramatic opening, chose the Congress to
announce his resignation from the Communist
Party. The party was split and demoralised, and
most of the Soviet peoples were losing conﬁdence
in Gorbachev and his reforms, which seemed onlyto be increasing the queues, the shortages and the
exorbitant black-market proﬁts. Corruption now

ﬂourished in low places too. People had got used
to freedom and began taking it for granted.At this late hour Gorbachev’s prime ministerNikolai Ryzhkov produced a cautious proposal for
economic reform which postponed any serious
move to a market economy and to realistic, unsub-
sidised prices. But were things about to change?While Ryzhkov tinkered with the economy,Gorbachev in January 1990 turned to a young
academic economist, Stanislav Shatalin, as an addi-
tional adviser. By the summer Gorbachev and
Yeltsin were cooperating, and they set Shatalin to
work at the head of a team of like-minded econ-omists to produce a programme that wouldrapidly introduce a market economy. By the end
of August the ‘500 Days’ plan was ready and
Gorbachev and Yeltsin agreed to back it.As summer turned to autumn Gorbachev beganto have second thoughts. He saw that all controlwas slipping from his hands, with the majority of
the party in opposition, the republics daily issuing
new independence claims and disregarding Kremlin
directives. Conditions had become so bad that
Gorbachev’s public credit was all but exhausted. Ifhe now adopted the shock therapy of the Shatalinplan, which would entail huge price increases and
considerable unemployment, he feared that the
Soviet Union would slide into anarchy. So he with-

drew his backing from Shatalin’s radical prescrip-
tion. To save the crumbling ediﬁce of the Soviet
Union, he discussed with Yeltsin and other repub-

lican leaders a new treaty which would preserve
the Union while making many concessions to the1THE SOVIET UNION, CRISIS AND REFORM805
republics’ demands for sovereignty. He was tryingto gain time.Signiﬁcantly he also turned to his hitherto con-servative opponents to bolster the Kremlin’s fail-
ing powers. In yet another change he abolished
the Presidential Council, and brought in the KGB,army and police to a new Security Council. Newhardliners suddenly became the president’s right-
hand men. Soon old Cold War rhetoric was heard
once again. The fourth session of the Congress of
People’s Deputies in December 1990 was memo-
rable for one astounding event: Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze publicly announced his res-ignation in protest against Gorbachev’s reliance
on reactionary party members. He warned against
‘the advance of dictatorship’.As the new year began, Gorbachev had fewideas left about how to lift the Soviet Union outof its crisis. When the military attempted to sup-
press the nationalists in Lithuania and Latvia and
snuff out their independence movements, the
people of Riga and Vilnius rallied to the defenceof their new democratic parliaments and govern-ments. The deaths of twenty civilians only
strengthened popular defiance as the people
erected barricades, and Gorbachev claimed that
he had not ordered the bloodshed. His main
efforts that spring and summer were to negotiatea new constitution with the republican leaders.Even as Georgia declared its independence in
April 1991, Gorbachev’s extraordinary negotiat-
ing skills scored one ﬁnal success. In May 1991
the ﬁfteen republican leaders, brought togetherby the president, agreed to form a new union.Later, nine of those republics, including the
Russian Federation, approved the ‘principles’ of
such a treaty, which was to be solemnly signed on
20 August 1991. But the hardliners struck back.
As the dramatic events unfolded in Moscow onMonday morning, 19 August, the whole worldheld its breath.The coup that should have been foretold caughtGorbachev completely by surprise. It was Sunday,18 August. Gorbachev was spending the last twodays of his vacation in his villa in the Crimea,
working on the speech he was to deliver at the
ceremony on 20 August marking the signature ofthe new Union Treaty. That afternoon he wasvisited by a group who represented, they said, aState Committee for the State of Emergency; they
demanded that he should proclaim a state of
emergency and hand over power to his vice-
president, Gennadi Yanayev. Gorbachev indig-
nantly refused. He was then kept prisoner in hisown villa and cut off from all outside contact,
while the coup got under way in Moscow. Early
the following morning, 19 August, Moscow
awoke to the news that Gorbachev was ill and that
an eight-member State Committee for the Stateof Emergency had taken over. Most shocking ofall, those men were not members of a reactionary
opposition but had been Gorbachev’s most recent
ministers, leaders and aides, the conservatives he
had chosen in 1989: Gennadi Yanayev, BorisPugo (minister of the interior), Dimitri Yazov(minister of defence), Vladimir Kryuchkov (head
of the KGB since 1988), Valentin Pavlov (prime
minister) and three others. It was a total betrayal.
Gorbachev was imprisoned and powerless forseventy-two hours; he prepared a videotape con-demning the coup, while his wife Raisa became
ill from the shock.All the action was in Moscow. The Committeeproclaimed a state of emergency and rule by
decree; demonstrations were banned; at middaytanks and troops appeared in the streets ofMoscow and were placed around key buildings.
The junta also issued a decree that the constitu-
tion of the Soviet Union took precedence over
that of the republics; it was to be the end of anynotions of sovereignty for the republics or of anew Union treaty. Boris Yeltsin just escaped arrest
and rushed to the Russian parliament building,
which was known as the White House because of
its white marble frontage. But the coup leaders
were inept and failed to act decisively and ruth-lessly on that ﬁrst day. They were out of theirdepth, and Yanayev, the titular head, was said to
be drunk most of the time.Yeltsin took his life in his hands when herushed to the White House. The most unforget-table image of the coup was presented by Yeltsinclimbing on to a tank just outside the Russian
parliament mid-morning on Monday the 19th.
He uncompromisingly denounced the coup and806THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
called for a general strike and popular support.But the response was patchy. The miners of theKuznetsk Basin beyond the Urals said they would
strike, but only in St Petersburg did the mayor
Anatoly Sobchak provide decisive support.The fate of the coup would be decided inMoscow. Yeltsin’s call for the people of Moscowto defend the Russian parliament building proved
decisive. Before his appeal no more than 200
people had gathered in front of the White House.
Millions of Muscovites simply went about their
business, fatalistically accepting the coup. ButYeltsin’s courage proved infectious. By Mondaynight there were hundreds more. The hours
passed, and it became evident that some elements
in the army and KGB were not behind the coup.
The expected attack on the White House did notmaterialise that night.By Tuesday night not thousands but tens ofthousands had gathered to protect the White
House, and barricades were thrown up. The
young conscript tank crews were bewildered. Itwas clear that, even if ordered to do so, theycould not be relied upon to ﬁre on the people.
Around one barricade there was a scufﬂe that

claimed three victims, the only deaths in Moscow.
Some tanks defected and joined the people in
defence of the Russian parliament. Tuesday mid-night passed without the expected assault on theWhite House materialising. Somewhat belatedlythe West on Tuesday condemned the coup out-right. On Wednesday it was all over. Kryuchkov
and Yazov tried to save themselves by ﬂeeing

from Moscow to negotiate with Gorbachev in the
Crimea; instead they were arrested there. All theprincipal plotters were soon in prison. Only BorisPugo escaped – by committing suicide.On Thursday, early in the morning, Gorbachevreturned to Moscow airport, to be met by Yeltsin
and a large crowd of well-wishers. But Gorbachev
was a defeated man. Yeltsin manoeuvred shrewdly,and made no attempt to replace Gorbachev ille-gally. Over the next three months he eroded the
Soviet Union until there was no job left for its
president. After his return Gorbachev had lost the
initiative by lining himself up behind the totallydiscredited Communist Party. Yeltsin had alreadybroken their power in the Russian Federation and
he now ﬁnished the job, shutting down the party
in Moscow altogether. Belatedly, on Saturday 24
August, Gorbachev announced his resignation asgeneral secretary and recommended that theCentral Committee dissolve itself, thus decapitat-
ing the party. It was ﬁnished. Hated party statues
were toppled from their pedestals. But one relic
survived: no one could bring themselves to
remove Lenin from the mausoleum.Yeltsin went on to sidetrack Gorbachev, whowas warning of the dangers facing the Soviet
Union if cooperation between the republics could
not be secured by a new Union treaty. Yeltsin
went ahead on his own, asserting Russian inde-pendence of action, and in October 1991 pro-posed a separate and radical economic reform
programme that was to lead to a free-market econ-
omy. The plan had been masterminded by the
young economist Yegor Gaidar and his team.
Yeltsin also began separate negotiations with theUkraine and Belorussia to ensure economic coop-eration between the republics. The formal preser-
vation of the Soviet Union still had some
advantages for Yeltsin’s Russian Federation as a
framework for essential trade interchange, espe-cially with the Ukraine. But when, on 1 December1991, the Ukraine in a referendum overwhelm-
ingly voted for independence the old Soviet
Union ceased to have much purpose. A week later1THE SOVIET UNION, CRISIS AND REFORM807
Yeltsin, 1991. © Associated Press, APon 8 December Yeltsin and the leaders of theUkraine came to an evidently hurried decision to make a complete break with the past and to 
create a new association, the Commonwealth of
Independent States, around the Slavic core of the
three republics (the third was Belorussia). Theywere joined by Kazakhstan, by the four otherAsian republics and then by three more republics.
As 1992 began, the eleven members of this new
Commonwealth still had many problems to sort
out, among them the control of nuclear missiles,
the future division of military and naval units andwhat uniﬁed structures should remain, their eco-nomic relationships and unresolved territorial
questions. The most critical issues concerned the
Ukraine and Russia, whose presidents had to sort
out the futures of the Crimea and of the Black Seaﬂeet, the transfer of nuclear weapons to Russia andtrade between the two republics. The death of the
Soviet Union solved a number of old problems,
but it also raised many new ones.On Christmas Day 1991, Gorbachev resigned,having to the last attempted to preserve the SovietUnion. His enormous achievements had been
rightly acknowledged with the Nobel Peace Prize.
His belief in a humane socialism was sincere, and
he knew that without legality in a state there
could be no humanity. During his years of power,the Gulags were liquidated, political prisonerswere set free and civil rights and freedoms were
returned to the Soviet peoples. His refusal to
protect the communist bosses in the former satel-
lites or to use the Red Army to quell popularunrest brought freedom to East Germans, Czechsand Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles, Bulgarians and
Romanians. With the freedom came new prob-
lems, in part the inheritance of decades of com-
munist misrule. But the nightmare of a nuclear
holocaust receded as the Cold War came to anend.All this was accomplished by one extraordinaryman, himself the product of a communist upbring-

ing and of a communist system, to which he
remained loyal to the end. He attracted able mento support him in his policies and created a massfollowing in the Soviet Union. At ﬁrst suspiciously

but later with matching openness, the West
responded. It was Gorbachev who did most to ini-
tiate the biggest change in global relationshipssince the Second World War. For this alone he willgo down as one of the great leaders of the twenti-

eth century, his a crucial role in shaping its history.We can also begin to understand the reasons forGorbachev’s failures, for they too are embeddedin his concept of ‘humane democratic socialism’.
He chose the opposite course to the Chinese
reformers of the 1980s. Gorbachev’s priority was
the reform of the party, to open the party to
democratic influences and competition, whichwould revive the Soviet economy as the burdensof war and bureaucracy were lifted from the
shoulders of the Soviet peoples. The expanded,
though still small, private sector of the economy,
which had always existed even under Stalin,would be allowed to compete with the revivedstate sector to increase efﬁciency without threat-
ening to overtake the socialist economy. But
Gorbachev always saw that the most urgent need
was for political reform, which he believed wouldlead to economic improvement.Six years from March 1985 were not such along time to bring about a root-and-branch
change in party and government after more than
sixty years of communist autocracy, whose basic
assumptions had never been challenged byKhrushchev or any of his successors. Gorbachev’sthinking was revolutionary and opened up the
possibility of a better future for the Soviet Union.
Neither he nor most of his contemporaries inside
and outside the Soviet Union foresaw where thesepolicies were leading, even while they could notfail to notice the increasing hardships placed on
the Soviet peoples during the years of political
transition. Gorbachev was blamed by Yeltsin and
his supporters, as well as by some economists in
the West, for not simultaneouslypursuing radicaleconomic market reforms as well. SignificantWestern credit was denied because of their
absence. But Gorbachev feared they would have
led to anarchy and chaos. Nowhere in the world
have bothdrastic political and economic changebeen attempted successfully at one and the sametime. During the 1980s Deng and the Chinese
reformers pursued economic reform while main-
taining communist political power largely intact.808THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963

He spoke
of democracy, but it was a democracy that was
meant to coexist with the role of the Communist
Party and its enormous bureaucracy, newspapers,
sanatoria, resorts and manifold privileges. Heconceded that the republics could leave theUnion if they wished, but sent in tanks and guns
to intimidate the Baltic republics when they
wanted independence without delay. The limited
sovereignty he was prepared to grant was far lessthan the republics were going to take if they didnot get their way. Unfulﬁlled promises lost him
the support of the Soviet peoples as the economy
spiralled into decline. Compromises here resulted
in the worst of two worlds. As he himself put it,at the end ‘the old system fell apart even beforethe new system began to work’ – but to what
‘new system’ was he referring? No new economic
structures were established as the old central-
planning apparatus disintegrated with the rise of
nationalism in the republics. And yet Gorbachev’sprecarious tightrope act might have lasted a gooddeal longer if the reactionary conservative leader-
ship had not attempted to topple him in August
1991. Nobody seemed big enough to step into
his shoes until Yeltsin emerged as the man of thehour, the saviour of Russia. The coup had sodiminished the Communist Party’s stature and
that of Gorbachev that the former was swept away
and Gorbachev himself was brought to the point
where he was the president of a Union that had
ceased to exist.The Russian economy continued its cata-strophic decline in 1992. Privatisations allowed
powerful oligarchs to secure the nation’s valuable
assets including oil and gas at a fraction of theirworth. The Russian people, despite showingextraordinary patience and fortitude, were becom-
ing ever more disillusioned with their rulers who
were unable to deliver a basic standard of living.The beneﬁcial results of Gaidar’s reforms failedto make themselves felt in ways the Russian peoplecould see. Gradually the reforms requiring strict
financial controls were relaxed. Roubles were
printed to pay the wages of workers in inefﬁcient
state industries. Without the control of a CentralBank, the republics printed more roubles until the whole country, ﬂooded with paper money,
plunged into hyperinﬂation by the end of the year.At the heart of Russia’s crisis lay not only aneconomic but also a political problem. Who was
in charge of what? Ministries and the Central Bankvied for control. Russia’s executive with Yeltsin at its head was subject to parliament, Russia’s
Congress of People’s Deputies. The Congress was
still packed with the communist deputies elected
in the spring of 1990 (when it was still theSupreme Soviet) before the failed coup of August1991. Yeltsin and the communist majority in the
Congress who disapproved of his reforms were at
loggerheads. Yeltsin showed some readiness to
compromise by dropping Gaidar in December1992 while assuring the international ﬁnancial
world that the path of reform would not be aban-

doned. The conﬂict between the opposition in the

Soviet parliament and the president threatened to
paralyse economic reform. On 21 September 1993
Yeltsin simply dismissed parliament and called fornew elections in December. A deﬁant opposition
condemned the decree, denounced it as uncon-

stitutional and set up a rival government with
Alexander Rutskoi as the new prime minister.
Yeltsin reacted by ordering the army to surroundthe White House, but still attempted to leave theway open for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
Instead, the 100-odd hardcore deputies who
remained deposed Yeltsin and declared Rutskoi
president. Rutskoi and the parliamentary speaker
Khasbulatov badly miscalculated in believing thatthey could swing the army and people behindthem. They attempted a coup and sent out a call
to supporters to seize Moscow’s television station.
On 4 October Yeltsin also responded with force
– ordering the tanks to ﬁre on the White House.
The spectacle was played out on the world’s tele-
vision screens. It was all over in twenty-four hours
and the deputies, Rutskoi and Khasbulatov sur-

rendered. The cost was some 140 dead and many810THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
injured. But the struggle between parliament andthe president was not over. The December elec-
tions proved disappointing for the reformers 
even though the new constitution proposed by
Yeltsin, which strengthened the power of the 
president, was accepted in a national referendum.The big shock of the elections was the emergenceof Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the populist ultra-
nationalistic leader of the anti-reform group mis-

named the ‘Liberal Democratic Party’, which
gained sixty-four seats. Yegor Gaidar’s Russia’s
Choice, a reformist party, secured a disappointingseventy seats, the Communist Party forty-eight,the anti-reform Agrarian Party thirty-three, and
the Women of Russia twenty-three. The balance
of forces is against radical reform even though 129
Independents were also elected. Russia’s newdemocratic institutions are fragile; the workings ofdemocracy are not fully understood in a factional
conﬂict lacking any consensus; the economy with
its constantly declining output is only being
reformed piecemeal. And added to the difﬁculties
of trying to maintain standards of living is theperipheral but lethal nationalities problem.Russia would also like to become a member ofthe European Union, but such a prospect lies years
in the future. The Russian people have faced seem-

ingly interminable years of reform and falling stan-
dards of living with astounding patience andfatalism. Serious conﬂicts that arose within the
country had national and ethnic causes. However,
solace is sought in the consumption of vodka.
Medical services lack the resources to deal withendemic poor health aggravated by alcoholism anda new threat, tuberculosis. Russia’s course of
reform has been erratic and uncertain. President
Yeltsin’s own mercurial performance was an indi-

cation of uncertainties of his policies. Nevertheless,
although Russia’s transition to market capitalism isfar from complete it has irreversibly moved awayfrom communism. Despite the fact that he con-

cealed a near-fatal heart condition the Russians
chose to stick with the devil they knew and re-
elected Yeltsin in June 1996.After surgery, the Russian president staged a remarkable recovery, and a new impetus to 
economic reform was signalled with the appoint-
ments of Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov as first deputy prime ministers. The task they faced in normalising the economy and the lives of the Russian people was daunting. Moreover, 
the young reformers faced opposition from the
Duma, controlled by communists and national-
ists; fortunately these opponents of reform havebeen held in check by the threat of losing theirseats and privileges in the event of an election.
Every year since 1992 it was hoped that Russia’s
economic decline had bottomed out. By 1996 the
ofﬁcial economy had shrunk to about half its 1989
level. Unsurprisingly the market economy failedto bring equal beneﬁts to all the Russian people.The young and enterprising, a minority, were
proﬁting from new opportunities. The super-rich
derived their new wealth from privatisations
riddled with corruption. Guns as well as briberyplayed an important role in this process and ‘pro-tection’ was paid to Maﬁa-style bosses. A small
group of bankers, who helped to ﬁnance Yeltsin’s
re-election, did particularly well by promising
loans in return for shares to cash-starved indus-tries selected for privatisation. However, despite‘protection’, bankers were at risk: over a period
of just four years, after 1993, 118 were murdered.Life has been hard for the ordinary people.The bright lights of Moscow and St Petersburg
do not reach the rest of the country and the pri-vatisation of agricultural land has made virtuallyno progress. The black economy ﬂourished while
taxes remain unpaid and for months the govern-
ment was unable to pay the army, health service
employees or pensioners. Trade was conducted asmuch by barter as by cash. Although privatisationof industry has made great strides it is hampered
by mismanagement. Some factories resorted to
desperate stratagems; TheEconomist
reported howone manufacturer of marine equipment, unable to
pay its workforce for over a year, switched pro-duction to rubber dildos, marketed as ‘Adam’,only to ﬁnd that they were unable to compete
against more sophisticated battery-operated
Western models available in Moscow. Market
research is evidently still in its infancy in Russia.Surprisingly, the armed forces of 2 million haveborne all these hardships and remained loyal. Badly
led, trained and equipped, the young conscripts
were unable to defeat the rebels of breakaway1THE SOVIET UNION, CRISIS AND REFORM811
Chechnya: the region was crucial to Russia’s econ-
omy as it is crossed by the main oil pipeline fromBaku. The unpopular war, begun in December
1994, was ended but not for long when General
Lebed took negotiations into his own hands; it had
led to more than 70,000 deaths and 240,000 casu-
alties and had solved nothing; the question ofindependence was postponed. In June 1996
Yeltsin cleverly harnessed Lebed’s popularity to
secure his own re-election, only to dismiss him a
few months later from his senior position as
national security adviser.The catalogue of what is wrong in Russia isinterminable and tends to overwhelm the more
positive growth economic indicators: a ﬂuctuating
Stock Exchange, the small positive growth of
GDP in 1997 after eight years of continuousdecline, and the taming of hyperinﬂation from2,500 per cent in 1992 down to a more acceptable
15 per cent. Russia possesses huge natural re-
sources, particularly gas, 40 per cent of the world’s
reserves of oil, much coal and timber, and almosta third of the world’s nickel; its low costs and educated workforce should now encourage devel-
opment. However, a country that has suffered
communist rule for over seven decades cannot be
transformed in a decade. Russia’s failure to achieve
sustained economic recovery was evident in 1999.Corruption remained a serious obstacle. Russiacame close to economic breakdown. Instability
increased as Yeltsin changed his prime ministers
while his health was failing – troubles enough even
without renewed war in Chechnya. But theStalinist days of isolation are over and a funda-mental change of attitude has taken place: Russia’s
leaders no longer fear an attack by their ‘capitalist’
enemies. Their country has now joined the global
economy and lives at peace.Over the ﬁnal years of the twentieth and earlyyears of the twenty-ﬁrst century the roller-coaster
ride of Russia’s progress came to an end. The
Russian economy had reached its nadir in 1998
with the rouble default. The income of the people
took a sharp drop, greater in an instance than dur-
ing the past ﬁve years. Inﬂation soared once more.The ‘oligarchs’, the old communist bosses who
had obtained state industries and resources for a
fraction of their true value, had shifted their lootabroad into safer currencies. Yeltsin’s court andfamily were enmeshed in corruption allegations.Worst of all, the ‘tiger’ who had stood on a Russian
tank defying and defeating the coup against
Gorbachev, seen on television occasionally receiv-

ing a foreign guest was wooden, immobile, quiteobviously a sick man, so political instability wasadded to Russia’s economic woes. When in the
summer of 1999 he appointed Vladimir Putin act-

ing prime minister and nominated him as his suc-

cessor, Russians and outsiders were astonished. No
one had heard of him outside a narrow Kremlincircle. Was this another of Yeltsin’s whims, the ﬁfth
prime minister in seventeen months? Yeltsin unex-

pectedly resigned early in 2000 instead of waiting
for the end of his term designating Putin as his pre-

ferred successor. Elections followed. Putin cam-
paigned to restore Russia internationally, and tostamp out resistance in Chechnya. In March 2000
he was elected president.As it was to turn out, Yeltsin had made a shrewdchoice. Putin had risen to power in positionsbehind the scenes. Still only forty-seven, he wasyoung and vigorous. A law graduate of Leningrad
University in 1975, he worked for ﬁfteen years in

the KGB espionage network. He gained civic
administrative experience in the ofﬁces of mayors

of St Petersburg and Moscow before beingbrought into the centre of government. From July1998 to March 1999 he directed the State Security
Service of the KGB as well as being secretary in the
Kremlin of the Presidential Security Council which
advised Yeltsin on the armed forces, police and thesecurity services. He was completely loyal toYeltsin and promised if elected president to safe-

guard Yeltsin and his family from corruption
charges. A small athletic man with unﬂinching eyes

rarely seen to smile, internationally he was an
unknown quantity, his past career not auguringwell for Russia’s constitutional progress.He began by renewing and stepping up thedeeply unpopular war in Chechnya. The towns
were in ruins, but complete paciﬁcation continued

to elude the Russian military. He attempted unsuc-
cessfully to counter increasing Western inﬂuence
among former satellites of Eastern Europe and
opposed their adhesion to NATO. His assertion of
Russian power got him nowhere. In the autumn of812THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
his ﬁrst year he was also wrong-footed at home.On the 21 October 2000 there was an explosionon the nuclear submarine, the Kursk, the pride ofthe ﬂeet. The 118 crew members were trapped on
the bottom of the icy Barents Sea. Until their oxy-

gen ran out most remained alive. But all foreignrescue offers during the crucial early days wererejected. The damage was blamed on a probable
collision with a US submarine. The true cause was
the explosion of a torpedo. Putin remained on hol-

iday. Popular anger mounted and Putin acted too
late. The Kurskdisaster was an indication of theperilous state of the Russian military, of a ﬂeet left
rotting in harbour, nuclear reactors in rusting
hulks. Military budgets had been slashed, morale
was low. Putin responded by tightening his grip.
In April 2001 he moved against the critical freepress and TV stations closing them down. TheDuma was subservient. Democracy was ‘managed’.
Putin acted against the oligarchs who had been pil-

lars of Yeltsin’s support; some ﬂed abroad rather

than face trial at home. Internationally Putinbecame more conciliatory.After a show of force, more theatre than realitywhen an advance force of paratroopers occupied
Pristina airport in Kosovo, Putin joined NATO’s
occupation, engaged in negotiations for further
nuclear disarmament with the US, was received byPresident Bush on his Texan ranch in November2001 and made no further difﬁculties when the
former Eastern European satellites and Poland
voted to join the European Union. Western pres-
sure to persuade Russia to end its military actionsin Chechnya also weakened after ‘September 11’,the ﬁghting dragged on seemingly without end.
Putin was prepared to grant a measure of auton-
omy but not independence. After a hiccup over
the Iraq war, Russian relations with the West
became watchfully cordial.Putin projected leadership and strength. WhenChechnyan fundamentalists took control of a
Moscow theatre and held the audience hostage,
Putin’s message was that he was working night andday in the Kremlin to save the hostages. A mishan-
dled rescue using gas to stun the Chechnyans killedmore than a hundred of their hostages as well as
the Chechnyans. But Putin was seen to have acted
decisively, he had learnt the lesson of the Kursk.On the economic front, the Russian Federationmade a remarkable recovery. The main reason forthis was the rise in the price of crude oil which had
already begun during the last year of Yeltsin’s pres-

idency when gloom was at its height. Russia in the
new century was at last moving toward sustainable
development. Business conﬁdence was growing,
an ambitious reform agenda was showing results,above all there was political stability. The economy
grew strongly and inﬂation fell to manageable ﬁg-

ures. There was a long way to go. Health provision
could not cope with the spread of HIV, TB andalcoholism. There is still serious corruption andthere are weaknesses in corporate legislation,
though foreign investment returned. Forty million
Russians still live in poverty. The economy remains
too dependent on the price of oil and the export ofprimary products. Reform of the military lagsbehind; nor is the broadening of democracy a
prime aim. The Russian people yearn more for a
better standard of living, a better quality of life,
ahead of a more accountable democratic govern-

ment. Authority is less feared than anarchy.Russia’s future in the new millennium began tolook much brighter than during the closing years
of the last. The world learned to appreciate the
new strongman, who in 2003 ofﬁcially became a

guest of the queen in Buckingham Palace. Theroyal–presidential courtesies symbolically buriedthe barbarities of the Soviet era. In March 2004
Putin won the elections with overwhelming sup-

port for a second term. Since then he has increased
presidential powers at the expense of moving
towards a Western-style democracy in the beliefthat it is the only way to overcome the immenseproblems Russia faces, not least in the conﬂict in

Chechnya.1THE SOVIET UNION, CRISIS AND REFORM813
Ronald Reagan had many detractors, whodirected sneers at the movie actor turned presi-
dent, the ‘great communicator’ who failed to
grasp the essential details of issues, the hands-offpresident. When he did stumble into trouble, as in the Iran–Contra affair, he did not appear to
realise precisely what or who had gone wrong. Yet
he retained his personal popularity throughout 
his two administrations, as troubles just seemed
to slide off him, earning him the nickname the‘Teflon President’. Was Reagan just lucky to be in the White House during a decade most 
of which brought increasing prosperity to the
Western world, in contrast to the difﬁcult 1970s?
Was he merely fortunate that the Soviet Unionhad gained a new leader in the mid-1980s whosaw the futility of the Cold War and was deter-
mined to end it? Or was there more to it? Perhaps
the judgement should be that Reagan spotted
opportunities and responded positively to them.
He was a likeable, kindly president and he had theskill to project his warmth. The American peoplewere in tune with his optimism; they wanted to
put Vietnam behind them. They responded to his
upbeat projections of a bright future and rejected
Carter’s gloomy ‘crisis of conﬁdence’ diagnosis ofwhat was wrong with America.Reagan was carried forward across the nation,not just in California, by a revival of the conser-
vative tradition that had already made itself felt in
the 1970s. It was a scepticism about the ‘nannystate’, about government’s ability to ﬁnd solu-tions to all the country’s ills, including thegrowing and predominantly black underclass, the
drug-use, the gun culture and the increasing
number of one-parent families. The Americanpeople would have to accept their responsibilities.Welfare meant taxation. In California in 1978, 
the state had to obey the results of a referendum
called Proposition 13, which cut property taxes
and so left the state budget with insufﬁcient funds
for all its welfare and social programmes. Reaganrecognised that the California tax revolt was notjust a local but a national issue. The diagnosis was
that taxation fell too heavily on the creators of
wealth. There was too much regulation stiﬂing
America’s natural enterprise. In his inauguraladdress he coined the slogan, ‘Government is notthe solution to our problem – government is the
problem.’ The US needed government, but it
should work with the people, not sit on their
backs. The US, he declared with some exaggera-
tion, was the ‘last and greatest bastion offreedom’.But how was America to be restored to great-ness and prosperity? An answer was seemingly
found. Reagan had been converted before the
elections to the theory of supply-side economics,or more precisely to the scientiﬁc truth of the‘Laffer curve’, the discovery of Professor Arthur
Laffer. If Carter was a born-again Christian,
Reagan was a born-again economist. On the face
of it, supply-side economics was a miracle: it heldthat if you lowered taxes you actually collectedChapter 70THE UNITED STATES, GLOBAL POWER
REAGAN, BUSH AND CLINTONmore revenue. The theory was that lower taxesgave firms more profit, and consumers moremoney in their pockets; this in turn would lead
to more investment and greater employment;
people would have more incentive to work
harder, and with increased economic activitymore tax revenue would be collected and unem-ployment and welfare benefits saved. Reagan
grasped that this was an attractive policy to put
to the American people. It left out of account,
however, the effects of inflation, from which
higher taxation inevitably followed as morepeople’s earnings were pushed into higher taxbrackets. Without constant rate reductions of tax,
taxation would actually become heavier.The objectives of Reagan’s economic policies,as put forward by the administration, were tolower taxes, to reduce government spending, tobalance the budget and to restrict money supply
so as to lower inflation. Professor Milton
Friedman of Chicago University was the money-
supply guru; he and Frederick Hayek attacked thenotions of the welfare state and socialism which,they taught, would lead to a totalitarian state. The
correct policy was to deregulate, to remove
restrictions on business and to allow free-market
competition. The combination of all these ideas
became known as Reaganomics. The economiccures for inﬂation and stagnation had already beentested in Pinochet’s Chile with some success. Now
they were going to be tried in the US.It sounded too good to be true; indeed, beforeGeorge Bush became vice-president, while he wasstill competing with Reagan for the Republicannomination, he coined the memorable phrase
‘voodoo economics’ to describe Reaganomics.
And it was too good to be true; all the objectives
could not be harmonised. The US did not balance
its budget as promised and turned a small nationaldebt into a large one. In other words, the excessof government expenditure over revenue income
in the Reagan years injected a signiﬁcant stimu-
lus to the economy in good old Keynesian fashion
at the cost of a ballooning deﬁcit.Deregulation, too, had its limits. Environ-
mental concerns cannot be completely ignored.
And there were instances where only one-half of a
business’s activities were deregulated. This storedup for the 1990s the Savings and Loans Associ-ation disaster. While depositors were federallyinsured (up to $100,000 in any one Savings and
Loans account), the ﬁnancial managers could now
operate without the severe restrictions on their
activities of previous years. To attract customersthey vied with each other to offer higher savingsinterest rates and so had to engage in more risky
investments themselves to be able to pay them.
With the collapse of real-estate markets at the
close of the 1980s, the insolvency of many of them
and of some banks involved the federal authoritiesin a huge ﬁnancial bail-out to compensate theinvestors. This is one important example of how
deregulation has not always led to the expected
good results.There was little sign that Reaganomics wasreally working during the ﬁrst two years of theadministration. Reagan wanted a 10 per cent
reduction in corporate and personal taxes in each
of the ﬁrst three years but this meant cutting the
federal budget too. Compensating completely forthe tax cuts would have been an exceedinglypainful process, though Reagan undertook not to
cut any essential welfare beneﬁts to the needy and
elderly. There was much waste, ‘pork barrel’
expenditure, that could have been cut, but mem-
bers of Congress ﬁercely defended their electors’favourite subsidies. Getting his budget proposals,substantially unaltered, through both Houses of
Congress in 1981 despite the Democrat majority
in the House of Representatives was a major tri-
umph for Reagan personally.In the end, Congress modiﬁed the biggest taxcut in US history only slightly; in the ﬁrst year
the cut would be 5 per cent instead of the 10 per
cent originally proposed, so as not to increase the
budget deﬁcit to inordinate heights, but accepted
10 per cent in each of the following two years.But the budget director, David Stockman, hadpresented an incomplete ﬁnancial prospectus. It
would have got any company director into severe
trouble. In his very critical inside story of his years
in the administration, published after his resigna-tion in 1985, Stockman depicts an almost unbe-lievable blindness to the realities of financial
arithmetic. The budget could not be balanced
given the large tax cuts andan increase of defence1THE UNITED STATES, GLOBAL POWER815
expenditure of 10 per cent per year. CasparWeinberger, previously renowned for his cost-cutting ways, was in charge of defence. A miscal-
culation had the consequence that instead of a
hefty 7 per cent per year real growth of expendi-

ture on defence, it actually came out at 10 percent per year from 1980 to 1986, that is risingfrom $142 billion in 1980 to a planned $368
billion by 1986. As it turned out, defence spend-
ing was trimmed so that by 1986 it had ‘only’
doubled to $273.4 billion.How then were the budget ﬁgures to add upto produce a balanced budget by 1984? The com-puter provided a simple answer. The supply-side
economic stimulus would increase output by
some 5 per cent a year. Instead the economy went
into recession in 1981 and 1982, thus creating aburgeoning deﬁcit. The recession brought inﬂa-tion under control, but unemployment increased
to 10 per cent – more than 11 million Americans
were out of work across the country. In some
regions unemployment was far worse than inothers, and black people and other ethnic minori-ties were especially hard hit. The ability of trade
unions to defend their members was weakened by
Reagan’s policies. The most dramatic showdown
came in 1981 when the air-traffic controllers’
union called a strike. Reagan took the tough deci-sion to dismiss all the strikers after they hadrefused to return to work. Military air-trafﬁc con-
trollers ﬁlled the gap until new personnel had
been trained. It was an example that Mrs
Thatcher was to bear in mind during her con-frontation with the miners in 1984. With defencespending protected by Reagan on the ground that
it was essential for facing down the Russians, and
with his insistence on persevering with tax cuts,
reductions in the growth of welfare spending took
the brunt of the economies, but they were quiteinsufficient to halt the growth of the budgetdeﬁcit. Some tax increases, implemented despite
the fashionable economic theories, proved too
small to bring the deﬁcit under control, and the
tax cuts turned out to have beneﬁted the rich far more than the middle-income families and the poor. Wealth had failed to trickle down to the
bottom 20 per cent, as the theories had predicted
it would.Reagan persisted with his unpopular policies.The economic turnaround began in 1983. Therefollowed six years of economic growth, despite
temporary blips (as in 1987), and the creation of
17 million jobs, though many of these were in
low-paying service industries. But was this due tothe virtuous effects of supply-side economics?Federal spending increased instead of declining
on all the major items, including social security
and various welfare payments. As the national
debt increased, so interest on it doubled, adding
$68 billion in just ﬁve years. Easy credit and thedeﬁcits put more money in people’s pockets andthey spent more. The supply-side economists’
prediction that investment would increase proved
wrong.By the end of the 1980s the US also had thelargest trade deﬁcit of any major industrialisedcountry. Even the proportion of gross national
product collected in taxes did not signiﬁcantly
decrease from the post-war average. So was
Reaganomics all smoke and mirrors? Was the USprosperity of the years 1983 to 1990 simply basedon borrowed time, on credits that have to be paid
for in the future? There is no simple answer. The
US is immensely rich in resources. By West
European standards, outlays on welfare were woe-
fully inadequate before 1981 and even increasedfederal spending has not brought it proportion-ally to the same level as in Germany, Britain or
France. That the US deﬁcit was not allowed to
soar out of control for a time owed much to a
reform enacted by the Senate and proposed bytwo Republican senators, Phil Gramm andWarren Rudman. This required the implementa-
tion of phased reductions of the deﬁcit and auto-
matic spending cuts (to fall equally on military
and non-military provision) when deﬁcit targets
were exceeded. Pension and poverty programmeswere excluded from the cuts. Reagan reluctantlysigned the measure in December 1985. It held
back the growth of the deﬁcits until the slow-
down in the economy later in the decade.The Reagan revolution was not as revolutionaryas it seemed. But the American people, who hadoverwhelmingly re-elected him in November
1984, gave the ‘old Gipper’ the beneﬁt of the

doubt. He remained throughout his latter years of816THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
office one of the most popular presidents inAmerican history. The economy continued torespond and unemployment did not rise above 7
per cent; people felt good – at least, most of them
did. The darker side was there too: ethnic discrim-

ination and poverty, crime and drugs, the decay ofbig cities, increasing indebtedness and an adversetrade balance. Despite the Laffer curve, there is no
miracle cure. Reagan, in fact, was a big spender on
programmes other than defence. The only way to
bring the budget into balance was by raising taxes.
Reagan would not hear of it, nor would George‘read my lips’ Bush during the presidential electionof 1988. It was one important reason for Bush’s
election victory that November over the Demo-

cratic candidate, who had been too frank. Yet the
spending spree of the mid-1980s came to haunt hissuccessor in the White House when the economyonce more turned down.If there was less of a revolution in US domesticpolicies than was thought at the time, a real rev-olution did occur during the Reagan years inAmerica’s role and standing in global politics. As
recently as 1988 distinguished academics were
vying with each other to analyse the reasons 
for America’s terminal decline. ‘Overstretch’ of
America’s ‘imperial’ global responsibilities was thefavourite diagnosis. How the picture has changedsince then! No doubt academics will catch up.Reagan certainly began his years in the WhiteHouse as an outspoken enemy of communism the
world over. Russia was an ‘evil empire’, and the‘focus of evil in the modern world’. The spreadof communism, especially in what Reagan per-
ceived as America’s backyard, Central America
and the Caribbean, he saw as a direct threat to
the security of the US, because communist victor-
ies in Nicaragua and El Salvador could spread toMexico and so to the very borders of the US. Thedomino theory was revived. Behind the global
dangers, the administration did not doubt, was
the hand of the Kremlin. The condemnation of
the Soviet Union reached its peak when a Sovietﬁghter in September 1983 shot down a Koreancivilian airliner that had strayed over militarily
sensitive Soviet territory. Many lives were lost,
including those of Americans.But there was always a positive side to theadministration’s and Reagan’s policy calculations.The Soviets were rational. If the US did not ﬂinch
from confrontation, from spending whatever was
necessary to ensure potential military dominance,
the basis would eventually be reached for anaccommodation, and for disarmament, especiallyof the nuclear arsenals. When Reagan launched
his Strategic Defence Initiative, or Star Wars as it
was popularly known, in March 1983 he knew
that the Soviets could not afford to keep pace.
SDI would, it was hoped, enable the US ultim-ately to defend itself against nuclear attack farmore effectively than the Soviet Union could.
The thinking was that there was not the remotest
possibility that the US would be the aggressor in
a superpower war, so the world would be safefrom nuclear war. Once the Soviet Union couldalso be persuaded to accept that the US was not
likely in the future to become an aggressor, the
huge nuclear arsenals would become redundant.
Serious disarmament could be given a chance,with nuclear and other weapons serving as alimited deterrent insurance. The great change
occurred in the Reagan era of the 1980s.The transformation in US–Soviet relationswould not have happened but for events outside
Reagan’s control, the changing leadership in theKremlin and the Soviet Union’s worsening eco-nomic plight. When Gorbachev became the
Soviet leader in March 1985, the scene was set
for a pas de deux that began with each leader
keeping a careful distance from the other andended in an embrace, with Reagan strollingcheerfully around Red Square in the spring of
1988. Perhaps only a president with Reagan’s
impeccable anti-communist credentials could
have persuaded Congress to accept that the Soviet
Union could be trusted to abide by the agree-ments reached and that it had ceased to be an ‘evilempire’.During his ﬁrst administration, Reagan’s cru-
sading rhetoric castigating communism and the
Soviet empire never really matched the administra-
tion’s actual policies. Although not ratiﬁed by the
Senate, the SALT II treaty provisions were
observed; this in the end proved to be to America’s
advantage. The scope for using American military1THE UNITED STATES, GLOBAL POWER817
forces was limited by a law passed by Congressafter the Vietnam War to restrict the president’sfreedom of action: this was the War Powers Act of
1973. The president as commander-in-chief was
still able to use armed force when he thought it
necessary, but he had to inform Congress withinforty-eight hours of their deployment abroad andwould have to withdraw them after sixty days
unless Congress speciﬁcally directed otherwise.
There were other realistic restraints. The Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 had led
to the retaliatory American grain embargo. But theUS farmers came ﬁrst; their plight induced the
Reagan administration to lift Carter’s embargo on
the sale of wheat in April 1981 and to follow this
up with further huge sales in 1983. That in turn
made it difﬁcult for the US to dissuade WestEuropean ﬁrms from supplying the apparatus tothe Soviet Union for oil and gas pipelines.
Meanwhile public opinion in the US and Western
Europe was becoming ever more hostile to further
nuclear escalation. Reagan declared that he wascommitted to arms control, but negotiations withthe Soviet Union made no progress during his ﬁrst

administration. Meanwhile, the Russians became
increasingly bogged down in Afghanistan. For the
US it was a Vietnam in reverse. With Pakistan as an
ally, it was able to arm the desperate mujahideen in Afghanistan, who inﬂicted casualties on the
Soviet troops, which proved unacceptable in an
unwinnable war.US involvement in the Lebanon and a MiddleEast peace process likewise made little headway.The US was not willing to use all its power tocoerce Israel and the Arab nations, and in any case
it was extraordinarily difficult to make much
progress on the Palestinian question. That part of
Carter’s Camp David agreements remained a
dead letter. Reagan sent 2,000 marines to theLebanon as part of an international peacekeepingforce after Israel’s invasion in 1982; in October
1983, 241 marines were killed in their barracks
by a fanatical Muslim. There was an outcry in the
US, and after a decent interval the marines werewithdrawn in 1984. The Middle Eastern prob-lems were now too great, and US policy too inde-
cisive, for the US navy in the Mediterranean and
a few hundred marines to provide a solution.The liveliest area of foreign policy was inCentral America and the Caribbean. In October1983 marines were sent into the island of
Grenada to remove an illegitimate left-wing
regime. Since Grenada was a member of the
British Commonwealth, Margaret Thatcher wasmuch annoyed. More serious was US interventionin Central America. Here Reagan and Secretary
of State Alexander Haig (and later his successor,
George Schultz) were ﬁghting communism most
actively. The Sandinista victory in Nicaragua had
brought a communist-style government to power,and the US had cut off aid; in El Salvador therewas a left-wing insurrection. The Reagan admin-
istration sent increasing quantities of military and
economic aid to the El Salvadorian government,
despite its appalling human-rights record. A warby proxy was being waged in Nicaragua, with theSoviet Union supplying the Sandinistas, and the
CIA from 1981 funding the opposition forces,
which became known as the Contras, operating
from bases in El Salvador and Honduras. Withmemories of Vietnam still vivid, however, Reaganfaced strong public opposition, which was re-
ﬂected in Congress. Most Americans cared less
about the excesses of the Sandinistas and the left-
wing rebels in El Salvador than about the possi-
bility that young US soldiers would be draggedinto the conﬂict, many of them to come home in body bags.Reagan’s convincing victory in the 1984 elec-tion strengthened his hand considerably. In the
course of his second term he was to meet the newSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ﬁve times. Attheir very ﬁrst meeting in Geneva in November
1985, the ice was broken. Reagan was a great
believer in the power of personal relations to
overcome set ideological positions. He came to
share Margaret Thatcher’s view that Gorbachevwas a new kind of Soviet leader with whom itwould be possible to negotiate on a more trust-
ing basis. The various on-and-off arms-reduction
negotiations had achieved very little so far. On
the table since 1981 was Reagan’s ‘zero option’:if the Soviets withdrew their SS20 and otherintermediate-range missiles in Eastern Europe,
the US would not counter them by sending over
Pershing and Cruise missiles to Britain and other818THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
NATO allies. The proposal did not affect missilesoutside Europe, that is in the US or Siberia. Sofar the Soviets had rejected this, and the US had
rejected Soviet proposals for deep cuts in both
sides’ nuclear arsenals. When Gorbachev and
Reagan met at Reykjavik in October 1986, theSoviet leader hoped that he could get Reagan togive up Star Wars by tempting him with a spec-
tacular agreement to reduce nuclear arms. Despite
his obvious disappointment at the failure of all his
efforts, Reagan stood ﬁrm. The setback proved
temporary. The Soviet need for Western techno-logical assistance and for defence savings wasurgent. In December 1987 the signing of the
INF (intermediate-range nuclear forces) Treaty in
Washington set the seal on the new US–Soviet
relationship, not only in settling direct issuesbetween them but also in the context of regionalconﬂicts all over the world. The treaty banned the
production and testing of intermediate-range mis-
siles, and all existing missiles in this class were to
be destroyed.Reagan’s policies in Central America were themost controversial in the administration’s conductof foreign relations. His appeal for support for 
the Nicaraguan Contras – ‘freedom ﬁghters’, as 

he called them – was rejected by Congress, which
conﬁned help strictly to non-military aid. Mean-while the peace initiative undertaken by theCentral American presidents was looked upon with
suspicion in the White House. The American eco-

nomic embargo of Nicaragua, the CIA’s mining of
its ports (1984) and the administration’s efforts to
keep the Contras in the ﬁeld did enormous dam-
age to Nicaragua’s economy, which had beenplaced on a war footing. Sandinista mismanage-

ment did the rest. When the Soviet Union and its
satellites eventually cut off aid to the Sandinistas,
the hardline Marxist–Leninists conceded genuinelyfree elections, which to their surprise they lost. Forthe time being at least, Reagan’s victory over com-

munism in Latin America was complete. The handling of the Middle East was the leastsuccessful aspect of the administration’s conduct1THE UNITED STATES, GLOBAL POWER819

there was no doubt which side the US favoured,
though it imposed an arms embargo on both
countries. Ayatollah Khomeini’s hate campaignagainst the US as enemy number one and thefanaticism of Iran’s Muslim fundamentalists
threatened the conservative Gulf oil states,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Emirates.
Consequently they supported Saddam Hussein’s
Iraq, even though he had started the Gulf Warwith his invasion of Iran. When Iran countered byattacking oil shipments from Kuwait, the US and
an international naval force moved in to protect
them. Kuwaiti tankers were reflagged in May
1987 so that they came under direct US protec-tion. US warships shelled Iranian oil installationsin reprisal for attacks on the oil tankers.Yet by a twist of fate the scandal that brokeconcerned illegal arms shipments from the US by
way of Israel to Iran. The cause was humanitar-ian. In the Lebanon imbroglio eight Americanhostages were taken by Lebanese groups such 
as the Hezbollah, the ‘Party of God’, believed to
be responsive to Khomeini’s commands. Their
release was secretly arranged in 1985 in return 
for secret shipments of desperately needed armsand spare parts to the Iranians. These were paidfor handsomely as well. The immediate organiser
of the deal was an intelligence operative in
Washington, Lieutenant-Colonel Oliver North. It
appears to have been his ‘neat’ idea that theproﬁts from the deal should be illegally chan-nelled to the Contras. One hostage had been
released and more releases were in prospect when
the deal leaked. The subsequent judicial and 
congressional investigations found that the par-
ticipants in the scheme, and Colonel North’s bossRear Admiral John M. Poindexter, the nationalsecurity adviser, had broken the law. President
Reagan accepted responsibility for dealing with
Iran, but not for the diversion of funds to the
Contras. It does seem unlikely that he fullygrasped what was going on. But the Iran–Contraaffair tarnished the administration’s record. With
the Iran–Iraq war ending in the summer of 1988,
the immediate urgency for active Gulf diplomacyappeared to have ended. But peace in the Gulfwas soon to prove illusory.When Reagan delivered his farewell address tothe American people on 11 January 1989 he
could claim with justice that ‘America is respected
again in the world, and looked to for leadership’.It was also true that countries ‘across the globeare turning to free markets and free speech – and
turning away from the ideologies of the past.
Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the pro-
foundly productive.’ The astonishing changes in
Eastern Europe in 1989 and 1990 were suddenlyto fulﬁl Reagan’s prophecy.Americans still felt good when it came to choosingbetween the two presidential candidates in
November 1988. The problems of deregulation,the deﬁcit budgeting, easy credit and junk bondslargely lay in the future. The economy was still
going strong, the balance of payments improving
and unemployment dropping to around 5 per
cent. But the Republican candidate Vice-PresidentGeorge Bush was not very inspiring and early inthe summer looked like losing to the Democratic
candidate Michael Dukakis, the governor of
Massachusetts, who had greatly improved the
economy of his state. More charismatic than either
was the Democratic leader, the Reverend JesseJackson. But the time was not ripe for an AfricanAmerican Democratic vice-presidential running-
mate. Bush further handicapped himself by choos-

ing Senator Dan Quayle, a personable conservative
politician who was considered too young and tooinexperienced. The election turned largely ondomestic issues. Dukakis warned of the need for
higher taxes. Bush riposted with ‘Read my lips, no
new taxes’; it became virtually his campaign slogan.
The Dukakis campaign, by way of contrast, was
inept and lost him his big early lead. ‘ContentedAmerica’, to use Professor Galbraith’s phrase, wasin the majority and turned to the safety of Bush
and to the comforting conclusion that spending
more money on welfare and urban deprivation
provided no solution to America’s social problems.It was enough for Bush to promise help where itwas really needed and to express the wish to create
a ‘kinder, gentler nation’. On 8 November 1988,
he won convincingly.820THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
In Congress in 1989 Bush faced Democraticmajorities in both Houses. The Democrats werenot inclined to vote for measures to reduce the
large deﬁcit if it meant cutting welfare, social
security, medical care for the old or any of the pet
‘pork-barrel’ projects that gained Democrats andRepublicans alike support from their constituen-cies. The president’s policies at home began cau-
tiously in 1989; with an eye on the deﬁcit, he
rejected public-spending increases. But the dereg-
ulation of the Savings and Loans institutions
during the Reagan years had led to imprudentlending and the imminent bankruptcies thatensued required a large federal bail-out. The
deﬁcit grew instead of shrinking, and the eco-
nomy began to show signs of downturn after the
credit expansion and stock-market wheeling anddealing of the 1980s.A severe recession began in 1990 and con-tinued through 1992. Despite his campaign
promises, President Bush was forced to raise indi-
rect taxes and reduce exemptions from tax for thebetter-off. He was widely blamed for not givingsufﬁcient attention to the state of the economy
and the rapidly growing unemployment. Yet for
a time his popularity reached extraordinary
heights. The explanation for this lies in ‘patriotic’
America. Bush’s forceful handling of Panamagained him enthusiastic support. The strongmanof Panama was the virulently anti-American
General Manuel Noriega, who was wanted in the
US for drug dealing. In May 1990 Noriega had
forcibly prevented the democratic oppositionleader from gaining the presidency: the electionshad been accompanied by violence, intimida-
tion and corruption. The US pressed for the
removal of Noriega, but without success. Finally
on 20 December 1989, a large US military force
descended on Panama City, causing some loss oflife and destruction. Noriega was cornered, cap-tured and brought to the US for trial, and the
opposition candidate of the previous May was
installed as president. But such forceful interven-
tion raised renewed fears in Latin America of‘gunboat diplomacy’.A much bigger issue was the Gulf crisis afterthe Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
President Bush’s consistent and decisive responsein leading the United Nations and forming acoalition of European and Arab nations to defendSaudi Arabia won him general support. The
despatch of ground troops, however, caused con-
siderable anxiety inside and outside Congress. By
the end of the year, from the Democratic side ofCongress especially, there was opposition to theuse of force and an insistence that negotiations
and sanctions should be continued and allowed
time to work. When the GulfWar was quickly

and brilliantly won with few American casualties
in 1991, Bush’s reputation was at its height.But Bush’s decision to stop the ﬁghting once
Kuwait had been liberated without toppling
Saddam Hussein was a profound misjudgement as
Hussein deﬁed the UN and was anything but
cowed. Nor did the immense efforts at mediationby Secretary of State James Baker, which broughttogether Israel and its Arab neighbours to try 
to negotiate a peace settlement at conferences 
in Madrid and Washington in the autumn of 
1991 and early in 1992, appear to lead to muchprogress.The Bush administration could certainly takecredit for responding positively to the changes in
the Soviet Union and for recognising that to
welcome the reuniﬁcation of the two Germanys
was a more realistic and productive policy thanthe more hesitant reactions in Western Europe.Nor should Bush or Baker be criticised for not
recognising the independence of the Baltic states
sooner, which would only have added to
Gorbachev’s difﬁculties. Gorbachev’s credentialsas an international statesman and peacemakerwere impeccable, while those of Boris Yeltsin
(then only a possible successor) were still untried.
Bush remained cautious throughout, preferring
what looked like the safer bet. Nor was he ready
to commit American resources or to sacriﬁce thelives of US servicemen for ideological reasons orto engage in war a day longer than was required
to meet American objectives. He could claim that
his had been a safe pair of hands.But the election in November 1992, with theCold War over, no longer turned on foreignissues or defence. Attention focused on domestic
problems, the state of the economy, the frustra-
tions of the economically disadvantaged and of1THE UNITED STATES, GLOBAL POWER821
the middle class, many of whom were threatenedby unemployment.The nation had become increasingly polarised,not simply between black and white Americans
but between the haves and the have-nots, as the
destructive Los Angeles riots demonstrated inMay 1992. The US might in this respect prove tobe something of a model for the future of other
highly industrialised nations. The development of
an ‘underclass’ of the poor, with the black ethnic
group its largest but not its only component,
could produce further violence, crime and drug-taking and increased dependence on welfare. Avicious circle was set up: inner-city ghettos with
deteriorating education and employment oppor-
tunities became the derelict homes of the poor.
Well-paid employment requires education andskills, and the market economy provided lessrather than more jobs for the unskilled. To put
them to work, to provide training and education,
to revitalise the inner cities, to provide more man-
ual jobs – all this would require more publicspending, which in turn would mean higher taxa-tion and sacriﬁces by the better-off. When the
poor and those on low wages constituted a major-
ity they represented political power, as in F. D.
Roosevelt’s day. In the last quarter of the twenti-
eth century their numbers had shrunk, however,and many were alienated from the democraticprocess, which they saw as unhelpful to them.
They no longer constituted so signiﬁcant a group
among those who vote. Less government interfer-
ence and lower tax burdens appealed to those whovote, among them a large elderly population whoclaimed medical and social beneﬁts fully, without
regard to their income and wealth.As long as the violence of the poorest section ofsociety was contained there was little real incentive
to ‘declare war’ on poverty, especially as it wascomfortingly argued that past efforts to do so inthe 1960s had not been effective. Now that the
Cold War was over, would the American people
resolve the crisis in many inner urban centres,
which at times of eruption could resemble a war?That was one of the large questions of the 1990s.The November 1992 election was a ‘three horserace’. A millionaire, Ross Perot, stood as an inde-pendent. It is a measure of America’s disenchant-ment with politics and a tribute to Perot’s gutsytelevision performances that he won 19 per cent of
the popular vote. A rather lacklustre Bush, who
could not persuade the American people that the
recession was over, lost the presidential electionbut only by a small margin of popular votes. Thereforming governor from Arkansas, Bill Clinton,
and his vice-presidential running-mate Albert
Gore, a senator from Tennessee, turned the White
House Democrat. The two men, both still in their
forties, belong to a new post-war generation.Clinton projected the aura that reminded Americaand the world of the dynamic Kennedy years 
with one signiﬁcant contrast. Unlike Jacqueline,
the new First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was 
a formidable partner actively involved in poli-tics. The question for the 1990s was how far a change in direction, and the abandonment of
‘Reaganomics’ would meet the challenge of guid-
ing the world’s largest economy forwards success-
fully and curing the ills of poverty and deprivationthat continued to exist in an avowedly afﬂuentsociety.The Clinton years at home were fortunateyears. The Cold War dividend appeared to be that
the US no longer faced any serious threats.
Clinton could choose to act abroad or not. Nolonger need the president send soldiers abroad torisk limb and life. The US could look after its own
interests at home. The American people would
give their support to a relaxed, comfortable presi-
dent who concentrated on making their lives bet-ter and when it came to the end of the ﬁrst termthey would re-elect him. The lesson learned from
Bush was that what mattered was the economy.Clinton’s conduct of foreign affairs changedmarkedly during his first administration from
1993 to 1997. In his election campaign heaccused Bush of looking abroad and neglectingdomestic issues. Clinton inherited the ill-fated
intervention in Somalia and the problem of Haiti,
where the military had driven out the elected
president; desperate refugees were ﬂeeing to theUS, many perishing in their overcrowded boats.The inhuman war in Bosnia had been raging for
a year, the Bosnian Muslims unable to defend
themselves. Clinton called for aid to Bosnia,822THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
NATO air strikes and the lifting of the armsembargo, but at this time, early on in his admin-istration, his stance lacked conviction. He could
do no more than Bush for the Bosnian Muslims,
the victims of aggression, since the administration
was not prepared to send ground troops, and airstrikes were vetoed by Britain and France. InOctober 1993 more forceful intervention by the
marines to end the clan wars in Somalia ended
with the naked corpse of an American helicopter
pilot being dragged through the streets of
Mogadishu. Evidence of American impotence wasdisplayed on television screens around the world.Clinton also dithered in his attempts to deal with
Haiti’s military junta; he was not prepared to risk
American lives to restore democracy. The 600
lightly armed US and Canadian peacekeeperswere ordered not to land on the island in the faceof an angry Haitian crowd assembled by the mil-
itary. The following year Clinton took the plunge
and the force sent to Haiti in October 1994
restored the elected president Jean-BertrandAristide, despite his suspected Marxist leanings. Itwas one thing to take military action in the
Western hemisphere – America had been doing
so for a century or more – but quite another to
intervene anywhere else. With the end of the Cold
War, Clinton’s attention turned from Europe toAsia, to trade with Japan and China, and humanrights. The US was no longer prepared to serve
as a universal policeman and in this Clinton
reﬂected the majority view in America. But the
wider world regarded the president as unequal tothe task of leadership.At home during the first year of Clinton’sadministration Congress frustrated many aspects
of his domestic agenda, in spite of the Democrats’
majority in both the Senate and the House of
Representatives. His only partial success was thepassage of a budget that demonstrated a measureof ﬁnancial prudence, raising the taxes of the rich
and providing some help to the poorest section
of society; the underprivileged would be encour-
aged to move back into work, cutting welfarespending. The ﬂagship reform, universal healthprovision, which had won him many votes in 
the 1992 election, was in the hands of his
redoubtable wife, Hillary, but she lacked experi-ence in handling Congress. Her ambitious plansto help 37 million Americans who had no healthcare were vetoed by special-interest groups and
conservative Democrats and Republicans in 
the House; they raised the old scare of social-
ised medicine, claiming that the ‘new tax’ wouldincrease unemployment. Meanwhile, HillaryClinton’s own standing was being undermined 
by allegations of wrong-doing. The Whitewater
scandal even cast doubts on the credibility of 
the president himself. In the summer of 1994 
the health bill was withdrawn. Hillary Clinton,both admired and derided for running a ‘co-presidency’, had to abandon her key role in the
administration, changing her image and support-
ing good family causes.Clinton displayed remarkable resilience in theface of political setbacks and personal attacks anddoggedly pursued his agenda of building a solid
foundation for America’s future prosperity and
inﬂuence, primarily through economic diplomacy.
He overcame the opposition of both Democratsand Republicans who feared that free trade wouldlead to unemployment, securing the passage of
the North American Free Trade Association
(NAFTA), which linked the US with Canada and
Mexico, in November 1993, and of the Uruguay
Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) in December 1994. He plannedto extend free trade agreements to include Chile
and the Argentine, and the whole of Latin
America (except Cuba) by 2005. Another free
trade goal was to link the US with Asia. First,however, he needed to correct the trade imbal-ance with Japan. Clinton’s threats had little
impact on the Japanese who, in many ways, con-
tinued to maintain barriers against foreign
imports. His efforts to link human rights in China
to trade with the US and to the granting of ‘mostfavoured nation’ status were even less successful.In the last resort American exporters were keener
on markets than on dissidents in China and
Clinton’s economic agenda in the end took prece-
dence. ‘Constructive engagement’ was nowdeemed the best way to inﬂuence China. Fenceswere mended with the European Union and in
December 1995 free trade between Europe and
the US was set out as a future aim. Thus Clinton1THE UNITED STATES, GLOBAL POWER823
was seeking to position the US, already the mostpowerful economy in the world, as the fulcrum ofglobal trade in the twenty-ﬁrst century. But in the
autumn of 1997 Congress baulked at allowing
Clinton wider powers – fast track – to negotiate
further trade deals.The failures of policies in China and Japanduring the early Clinton years were obvious; the
successes, whose beneﬁts lay in the future, did not
make as much impression on the public as the
continuing scandals enveloping the White House.
Clinton alienated many of his own supporters; theliberal Democrats condemned the policy of grant-ing China most favoured nation trading status
despite its human-rights abuses; they were also
opposed to his plans for limiting welfare and to
the introduction of a tough crime bill. Clinton’sagenda was changing and moving to the right; hisapproval rate was falling. Recognising that there
was a political vacuum and a lack of a clear
mission, congressman Newton Gingrich, the
Republican whip in the House of Representatives,seized the initiative and set out a new Republicanmanifesto for the November 1994 congressional
elections, a ten-point conservative ‘Contract with
America’ which sought to end ‘undeserving’
welfare for unmarried teenage mothers; to
provide tax breaks for the better-off; to opposeUS participation to UN peacekeeping all aroundthe world; and to promote ﬁscal responsibility.
Many voters, disillusioned with politicians in
general and the Clinton presidency in particular,
chose to stay away from the mid-term elections.The Republicans won a sweeping victory, captur-ing both the House and the Senate; Newton
Gingrich became the new speaker of the House.Despite a largely Republican Congress, fromthe low of autumn 1994 Clinton managed to win
back the support that would lead to his re-election in November 1996, showing a new polit-ical astuteness and employing successful measures
at home and abroad. In the Bosnian wars the US
seized the initiative and put an end to the ﬁght-
ing: the UN embargo on arms was ignored andthe Croats and the Bosnian Muslims were per-suaded to form an alliance to defeat the Serbs.
Diplomatically the US played a predominant 
role in fashioning the Dayton Agreement inNovember 1995. A week later, on his visit toNorthern Ireland, Clinton was greeted as a peace-maker. In March 1996 he took a ﬁrm line on
China’s threat to the Taiwanese presidential elec-
tions; China engaged in military manoeuvres,
ﬁring missiles close to Taiwan, but the crisis wasaverted. In foreign affairs Clinton could no longerbe regarded as a novice.At home Clinton succeeded in portraying theRepublican Congress as extremist in its domestic
policies while he himself took the centre ground.
The ‘New Democrat’ agenda was tough on crimeand tough on welfare for the ‘undeserving poor’;the government would provide education and
training to enable welfare recipients to return to
work, punishing the recalcitrant by withdrawing
support. The programme sounded attractive tothe majority of Americans, who were enjoying abuoyant economy with unemployment under 5
per cent. The declining auto industry was restruc-
tured and modernised; ‘Silicon Valley’ symbolised
America’s leadership in the ﬁeld of informationtechnology; up and down the country in busi-nesses large and small management and workers
demonstrated their capacity to change and com-
pete. Prosperity now depended on the export of
goods and services, which made up a third of the
Gross Domestic Product. A political consensushad been reached for the government to downsizeand to balance the budget by 2002. On these fun-
damental issues the New Democrats and the
Republicans were largely in agreement, although
Clinton vetoed the more stringent cuts to suchentitlements as the Medicare programme for theaged. However, in December 1995 Congress and
the administration were deadlocked over the bud-
get. The spectacle of unpaid federal employees
rebounded on speaker Gingrich and the Republi-
cans, who were forced to compromise. Clinton’sappeal became a broad one for moderates acrossparty lines. However, on racial issues he followed
more conservative and traditional policies of inte-
gration through education and training. As black
and Hispanic Americans climbed the ladder ineconomic-social terms so, it was argued, wouldthe bitter divides of race diminish.By November 1996 Clinton was well placed.His most dangerous potential opponent in the824THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963
presidential elections, General Colin Powell,chairman of the joint chiefs of staff during theGulf War, had declined to be considered for the
Republican nomination. The Republican contes-
tant Senator Robert Dole fought a campaign
marked by its decency; Ross Perot dropped outas a third party candidate. Clinton was nowhelped by an economic boom: living standards for
the majority of Americans were rising for the ﬁrst
time in years. Violent crime was falling, but so too
was job security for the professional managerial
class and blue collar workers as industry and ser-vices restructured, often with scant regard foremployees. Flexibility was now the key. Those at
the top made huge proﬁts; far more lost out.
Great problems remained to be solved: the decay-
ing inner cities, drugs, health care, and the situa-tion of the underclass in deprived areas –predominantly black and Hispanic people.It was clear, however, that the Americandemocratic process was crying out for reform.
Anyone seeking election in the US requires ahuge campaign chest. The public money allocatedto a presidential candidate is overshadowed by
donations made by people who usually expect
something in return. Clinton’s fund-raising activ-
ities laid him open to criticism. A night in
Lincoln’s bedroom in the White House is inno-cent of consequences; more questionable are largedonations, especially those made by foreign fund-
raisers. In their quest for funds candidates are
sometimes tempted to cross the uncertain line
between legitimate dealings and corruption.Throughout his years as president Clinton hashad to answer accusations of misconduct of one
kind or another; his wife’s involvement with the
failed Whitewater venture has been another source
of attack. Allegations of false testimony led to
impeachment proceedings in Congress and per-sonal humiliation. Clinton was shown to havebeen hair-splitting with his interpretation of the
facts.The drama was played out on countless TVscreens and in the press and diverted attentionfrom more serious issues. The American peopleavidly read the latest revelations of the long-
drawn-out Monika Lewinsky affair: a pretty
young intern, a middle-aged charismatic presi-dent, a stoical family, then the clues, a black dress,a semen stain, talk of cigars – denials and admis-sions, the indefatigable prosecutor’s hunt for
precise sexual detail at a cost of over 40 million
dollars; did the president lie about his personal
life? If anyone but the president had beeninvolved, the story would not have rated amention in the media, it is commonplace. It cer-
tainly does not rate with Watergate. The House
of Representatives sent the case for impeachment
to the Senate. In the Senate ten Republicans
joined the Democrats in February 1999 to acquitthe president of perjury, in any case theRepublicans could not have secured the necessary
two-thirds majority to convict. The real loser was
not Clinton but Al Gore the next Democratic
presidential candidate who shunned the supportof Clinton in the campaign.Soon it was politics as usual again. Clinton wasriding high astride the longest economic expan-
sion in US history, unemployment rate down to
4 per cent, personal incomes had soared andfuelled increasing consumption, the housingindex up by a third, despite the warnings of the
chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan
of ‘irrational exuberence’, the stock-market rise
made everyone feel rich, able to afford more,
never mind the mounting debt; the federal treasury was a beneﬁciary as lower taxes kept thecoffers full. ‘Goldilocks’ was the name given to
this wonderful ‘new economy’; fortunes were
made overnight as gullible investors chased the
offerings of new high-tech startups and dot.comsto stratospheric heights ignoring their lack ofearnings. Old traditional telecoms too were
caught up in the bubble, and ‘creative account-
ing’ made sure that wonder companies became
ever more wonderful and enriched their promot-
ers including venerable and trusted Wall Streetbrokers. The Reagan tax cuts, however, ratherthan Clinton’s policies had fuelled a boom that
could not be sustained. It was coming to an end
as Clinton left office. At least he had done
nothing during his two terms to get in its wayand the American people were grateful. His per-sonal popularity remained high matching the
country’s optimistic mood. But the election of
2000 was bitterly contested.1THE UNITED STATES, GLOBAL POWER825
Abroad Clinton had tried in vain to steer clearof using US power aggressively. But after diplo-macy had failed he did intervene in Kosovo in
March 1999 to put an end to Milos
ˇevic´’s mur-derous campaign against the ethnic Albanian
people; he did so in a way that would endangerthe least American lives, from the air. He resistedthe call by Britain’s prime minister Tony Blair to
oust the Serbians by an offensive on the ground
using such of the NATO allies prepared to par-
ticipate. This prolonged the conﬂict and caused
even greater suffering. It was left to the Serbs inthe following year to oust Milosˇevic´. The samereluctance to act marked his policy towards Iraq
even after the UN weapons inspectors were
thrown out. Saddam Hussein deﬁed the UN who
countered with economic sanctions. Britain andthe US limited their intervention by deﬁning pro-tective no-ﬂy zones in the south and north of Iraq
and from time to time punishing the military by
missile attacks on their bases. No US military per-
sonnel would be put at serious risk.On reducing the nuclear missile threat,Clinton made little headway. The technology for
an effective missile defence system, successor to
Star Wars, simply proved inadequate and hugely
costly if attempted. US intervention in Haiti in
1994 turned sour. The military were turned outbut Bertrand Aristide installed as the elected pres-ident did not halt violence or the country falling
into deeper poverty. In Cuba, Castro continued
to symbolise the patriot standing up against the
bullying US. Clinton did not lift the tradeembargo applied practically by the US alone,though contacts increased and tensions lessened.
US policies have done nothing to increase its
inﬂuence. Clinton deserves credit for his attempts,
down to his ﬁnal days in the White House, to
move forward the Palestinians and Israelis in apeace process. Had he succeeded that alonewould have ensured his place in history. It was
not due to lack of effort on his part that he failed
when at one time a peace deal seemed within
grasp at the Camp David negotiation betweenArafat and Barak in September 2000. Clinton leftthe White House, a well-liked president at home
and respected for his contributions to peace-
making abroad. His years in the White House areremembered for continuous prosperity and nofatal adventures abroad, in the end a respectablerecord of achievement.Vice-President Gore should have been able tocapitalise on the successful Clinton White Houseyears. The scandals and sleaze of the Clinton yearswere not the uppermost election issue Gore had
to fear. Gore had none of Clinton’s easy charm
and fought an uninspiring election campaign.
George W. Bush, son of former president George
Bush, also started with a handicap, a notoriousinability to speak English without making errors.As a popular two-time governor of Texas, he had
earned a reputation for toughness on crime. His
ideology was ‘compassionate conservatism’.During his election campaign he avoided themistake his father had made of making promisesit turned out he could not keep. His promise to
cut taxes was popular, his undertaking to put ‘a
touch of iron’ in foreign relations not sufﬁciently
speciﬁc to be alarming; on the hotly contestedquestion of abortion, he was non-commital.Gore’s proposed tax cuts were targeted more to
the less well-off and more cautious than those
proposed by Bush. Gore’s health plan reforms
relied less on private insurance and added a beneﬁt
for prescriptions; Bush relied more on private pro-vision, Gore on state and federal assistance. Thedifferences were not huge, the electorate equally
divided between the two candidates.After the votes had been cast on 15 November2000, the outcome was in doubt and dependedon a few hundred cast in Florida. In Palm BeachCounty the arrangement of candidates on the
ballot paper had confused some voters; in the

ﬁrst in each of the Union’s states. Would GeorgeW. Bush be able to claim sufﬁcient legitimacy to be able to act as president? The US constitu-
tional process and Gore’s graceful concession 
triumphed. All doubts were dispelled that what-
ever reservations people had about the function-ing of the electoral laws, which differed from stateto state, the imperfect machines and other ﬂaws,
the nation had to rally behind President George
W. Bush on his inauguration in January 2001.During the Reagan–Bush era the US’s northernneighbour Canada faced serious constitutionalproblems. The Liberal Party, in power since 1963
except for a period of nine months, was swept out
of ofﬁce in the general election of 1984 by the
Progressive Conservative Party led by BrianMulroney. It was the end of the Trudeau era;Pierre Trudeau himself gave up the leadership of
the Liberal Party. Canada thus followed the sea
change of Western politics, adopting policies 
to roll back the frontiers of the state, cut gov-ernment spending and encourage business enter-prise. Mulroney also promised to solve Canada’s
longstanding constitutional problems, especially
the question of French-speaking Quebec. His
approach was conciliatory, though he was soon
perceived as too irresolute.Canada beneﬁted from the upswing that liftedWestern economies after 1982, and its gross
national product grew strongly until 1990. A
major plank of Mulroney’s strategy was a drive for
free trade. After ﬁerce debate about the threat toits independence, Canada in 1988 concluded atreaty with the US that came into force in January
1989 and provided for the dismantling of all trade
barriers over a ten-year period. Already 70 per
cent of Canada’s trade was with the Americans.
The satisfactory state of the economy enabledMulroney’s Progressive Conservative Party in thefederal election of 1988 to retain power with an
overall majority. But the constitutional issue
raised by the passionate desire of French-speaking
Quebec to preserve its identity was becoming theburning question in Canadian politics. For theﬁrst time Canadians were talking of the unthink-
able, namely that the Canadian federation could
break up.A new constitution designed to regulate relations between the provincial and federal gov-ernments, devised by Trudeau in 1982, had
foundered on the objections put forward by
Quebec. Nonetheless, Mulroney and the prime
ministers of the ten provinces reached an agree-ment in June 1987 known as the Meech Lake Accord, which accepted French-speaking
Quebec’s demand to be recognised as a ‘distinct
society’. The agreement next required ratiﬁca-

tion by the parliaments of the provinces. In
December 1988 Quebec’s prime minister RobertBourassa insisted that in Quebec only externalsigns in French would henceforth be permissible.
That infringed the rights of the 12 per cent of 
the province’s population who were English-
speaking. The language issue was symbolic ofdeeper intentions and aroused a storm in theEnglish community. Two English-speaking prov-
inces now put off decisions to approve the 
Meech Lake Accord. If it was to come into force,
it required the unanimous approval of all theprovinces by June 1990. In the end only eight,including Quebec, had approved and Manitoba’s
and Newfoundland’s refusal to ratify meant that
the Accord lapsed.Negotiations for a solution had to be begunanew. The pro-independence parties in Quebecgained in strength. The chances of a successfuloutcome had deteriorated since the abortive
Meech Lake Accord. The English-speaking
provinces questioned why Quebec, which had
already beneﬁted disproportionately from federaleconomic aid, should be granted special status.Mulroney was further weakened by his personal
unpopularity, and that of his government, while
Bourassa had to maintain his position in Quebec
against the rising tide of sentiment favouring
independence. Nevertheless, a new agreementwas eventually hammered out and announced inSeptember 1991 by the federal government and
the provincial prime ministers embodying far-
reaching constitutional changes. These included
the crucial recognition of Quebec as a ‘distinctsociety’ and the granting of self-government toCanada’s indigenous peoples, the Amerindians
and the Inuit. The referendum throughout
Canada in October 1992 saw the rejection of the1THE UNITED STATES, GLOBAL POWER827
constitutional proposals. This in part reﬂected theunpopularity of Mulroney; moreover, the major-ity of English-speaking Canadians felt that the
concessions to French-speaking Canadians went
too far. Three years later, in October 1995, a ref-
erendum in Quebec failed to gain a majority forindependence by the narrowest of margins.A political sea change occurred in 1993. TheOctober election results nearly wiped out the
Progressive Conservative Party, reducing their
representation in Ottawa from 155 to 2; the
Liberal Party won 177 of the 301 seats, the sep-aratist Bloc Québécois, led by Lucien Bouchard,54 seats, and the right-wing Reform Party of
Western Canada 52 seats. These elections were
the ﬁrst to be held on the basis of ‘ﬁrst past the
post’ in each constituency instead of proportionalrepresentation and so no longer reﬂected the per-centage vote cast country-wide. That is why the
Bloc Québécois, whose support was concentrated
in French Canada, gained 54 seats with 14 per
cent of the vote nationally, while the Conserva-tives, with 16 per cent spread widely, capturedonly 2 seats. After the elections Prime Minister
Jean Chrétien, after nine years in opposition,
formed a Liberal government. His administration
set out to cure Canada’s economic ills: at the cost
of unemployment the government cut its spend-ing and the deﬁcit. The economy revived, thoughunemployment remained at 9 per cent in 1997.
The problem of Quebec appeared to have eased
after the issue of separation was addressed in
1995, when a dramatic referendum for inde-
pendence failed by only 50,000 votes.Canada’s federal future continued to defy anyagreed solution and looms large in national
politics. Earlier attempts to agree on constitu-
tional change at Meech Lake in 1987, or
Charlottetown in 1992, ultimately failed to winthe approval of the English-speaking voters. Inthe west, Preston Manning led the Reform Party
opposed to special treatment of Quebec and
recognition of its ‘distinct society’, but he toowanted to win greater autonomy from the federalgovernment in Ottawa. The general electioncalled by Chrétien in June 1997 left the Liberals
as the largest party but also reﬂected the growing
divisions of Canada.During the last years of the twentieth centuryand early years of the twenty-ﬁrst the politicalissue that had divided Canada for decades – the
demand of francophone Quebec for independ-
ence – began to ease. The federal elections in 
June 1997 though reducing the strength of the
Liberal Party, returned Jean Chrétien to the pre-miership. He was now prepared to take a strongerline on the issue of Quebec, and was fortiﬁed by 
a decision of the Supreme Court in the following
year that a unilateral declaration of independence
would not be legal. While the charismatic leader,Lucien Bouchard, prime minister of Quebecprovince, continued to claim that the aim of his
party, the Parti Québécois, was independence,
after having already lost referenda in 1980 and
1995 he was in no mood to attempt a third. His more ﬂexible attitude and good governmentcontributed to his continuing in power after 
elections in Quebec in 1998, but the opposition
had also found a charismatic leader in Jean
Charest. In Canada there was general satisfac-
tion with Chrétien’s government, the strongeconomy in 2000 helping to secure his third vic-tory in seven years in the November general elec-
tion. Canadians were more concerned with the
economy, unemployment and health care than
with constitutional issues. This was true also ofQuebec where in elections in April 2003 the PartiQuébécois was ousted from ofﬁce after nine years.
Although 80 per cent of the 7.4 million popula-
tion of Quebec is French-speaking they deserted
their old-style political leadership and voted for 
a third party, so helping Charest and his Canadianliberals to a stunning victory. The uncertainty overthe stability of Canada has lifted, and government
could address the economic issues during a period
of difﬁcult world conditions.828THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET BLOC AFTER 1963

WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS
STRENGTH: AFTER 1968The 1960s mark a dividing point in the history ofthe Western world. The old generation in govern-
ment was passing; the welfare state had come to
provide a safety net; a university education was nolonger the preserve of the privileged few; theyoung were freed from sexual taboos and fears,
and they discovered a new sense of identity and
mission: romantic, idealistic, searching for a cause
more worthwhile than crass materialism in a secu-
lar age. That similar feelings were burgeoning inthe Soviet-dominated East becomes clear fromevents in Poland and from the Prague Spring, but
for the most part repression kept the lid on free
expression. In the US, university students on the
eastern seaboard in particular identified them-
selves in the 1960s with the civil-rights cause ofblack people, though in this context they had the
support of a new-generation president in J. F.
Kennedy. Elsewhere the old generation was still in
control, typiﬁed by de Gaulle in the Elysée. In the
US the promise of the Kennedy years ended withthe president’s assassination. Vietnam increasinglyblighted the lives of youth, of the conscripts sent
to ﬁght on the other side of the world; the war
became the focus of a new student protest move-
ment and aroused general disillusionment withthe honesty of those who governed.For the West German youth there was theadded trauma of the question ‘What did my par-

ents do during the war?’. The almost total silence
in their country about the Nazi past only widenedthe gulf between the generations. As the activeprotesters in Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt sawit, the ‘grand coalition’ of Kiesinger–Brandt was a
cynical closing of the ranks of the establishment.
There was a short-lived resurgence of the extremeright, a switch of voters from the CDU, for whomthe coalition with the Social Democrats was repug-

nant. Far more substantial was the movement by
those on the left who could not stomach the coali-

tion for exactly the opposite reason and felt disillu-

sioned by Willy Brandt’s political manoeuvres.This discontent was fanned by the stirringnews of student riots in Paris and throughout the
Western world. Self-styled international student
leaders emerged and became cult ﬁgures. The

protesters were right about some of the causesthey espoused – the need for practical reforms inthe universities, for example, or the campaign
against excessive police repression, which threat-
ened civil liberties – but they were naive to
suppose that they could spearhead a Trotskyist or
anarchistic revolutionary movement. They them-selves were mainly the offspring of the better-off,privileged professional and middle classes, and
workers in Germany, France and Britain felt little
sympathy for them and less urge to identify with
their manifold causes. What gave the studentrioting such potency, nevertheless, were the tele-vision cameras transmitting into millions of
peaceable sitting rooms scenes of blazing petrol
bombs and charging policemen.The single event that provided the spark andallowed the ultra-left to capture the student1Chapter 71THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLICREACHING MATURITY
organisations was the brutal reaction of the Berlinpolice to students demonstrating against the visit
of the Shah of Iran. On 2 June 1967, a police-
man shot and killed an unarmed student, who at
once became a martyr. Street battles followed inseveral German cities. But the student movementhad no alternative to offer to German society; no
extreme leftist movement could evoke mass sym-
pathies with the spectacle of communist rule in
the East before everyone’s eyes. Did the studentmovement, then, achieve anything beyond thereform of its own nest, the universities? It prob-
ably strengthened the feeling that there was a
need for change; some politicians like Willy
Brandt, leader of the SPD, understood that here
was a new electorate, a new generation to be lis-tened to and reconciled to the democratic insti-tutions of the Federal Republic created by the old
founding fathers.By the time the general election was held inSeptember 1969, the grand coalition had fallenapart. The SPD had substantially increased its shareof the vote, the German economy having recov-

ered under the guidance of a Social Democratic
minister working in tandem with Franz Josef
Strauss, thus ridding them of their ‘red’ image.The CDU/CSU, nevertheless, remained the lead-
ing party; its partner, the FDP, lost heavily and
now switched its support to the SPD, which under
the leadership of Willy Brandt offered a fresh direc-

tion in foreign policy. Together they formed thenew government. It was the start of a new periodof SPD–FDP rule. In this way, the system of pro-

portional representation had in 1969 placed the
party with the largest number of votes, the
CDU/CSU, into opposition; by far the smallest of
the three parties, the FDP, had decided which ofthe two major parties was placed in power. Withless than 2 million votes, and barely passing the 5
per cent threshold necessary to gain representa-

tion, the FDP had brought about a decisive change
by switching sides. The working of democracy832WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968

ble had strengthened parliamentary government inthe Federal Republic.The Federal Republic now had its Kennedy inthe charismatic Willy Brandt, a youthful 55-year-
old. He had played no part in Nazi Germany, emigrating in 1933 when only nineteen years old.He had lived in Norway and eventually ﬂed to
Sweden. In 1947 he resumed his German citizen-

shipandtenyears later became a courageous mayor

of Berlin, championing the rights of the Berliners.His anti-totalitarian and anti-communist creden-tials were impeccable. A long period of ofﬁce

appeared to stretch before him especially after the
electoral victory in 1972, which for the ﬁrst time
made the SPD the leading party. But his trust in a
refugee, Günter Guillaume, originally from EastGermany, who served on his staff and was privy tostate secrets, proved to be misplaced. Guillaume
turned out to be a spy and Brandt, accepting
responsibility, resigned in 1974. But it had been 
a remarkable ﬁve years, not least for the new direction he had given to the Federal Republic’srelations with the Soviet Union and its Eastern
neighbours, a policy known as Ostpolitik.Brandt contributed to the climate of detentebetween East and West; he was not simply react-
ing to it. A quarter of a century after the end of the war, he believed the time had come to nor-malise relations in central Europe. The Federal
Republic’s refusal to recognise the ‘other’ German
state, the German Democratic Republic had pre-
vented all negotiations with the DDR whichmight ease the hardships inﬂicted on families bythe division of Germany. In 1954 Adenauer had
solemnly pledged that the Federal Republic would
alter no frontiers by force of arms, but that pledgehad been given only to the Western allies. TheFederal Republic’s claim to speak for all Germans,its refusal to recognise annexations by Poland eastof the Oder–Neisse (Silesia), the talk about ulti-
mate reunification and its strident hostility to
communism, all made it appear that the Federal
Republic was a threat to the security of theGerman Democratic Republic and Poland if givenhalf a chance. Such views of an aggressive West
German state did not reﬂect reality either.Periods of detente in East–West relations havesucceeded particular crises. The Soviet invasion ofCzechoslovakia in 1968 was followed by a decadeof diminishing tension and bridge-building.
Brandt’s policy of accepting the existing frontiers
of the Federal Republic and recognising the
German Democratic Republic required West
Germans to overcome a deep psychologicalbarrier and to sever certain links with the past.But, eventually, the eastern territories were juridi-
cally abandoned and the legitimacy of the
German Democratic Republic accepted.The foundation of the Ostpolitikrested on ﬁvetreaties. In August 1970, Brandt travelled toMoscow, as he said, ‘to turn over a new page of
history’, and he called for an end to enmity and for
a partnership between the peoples of Eastern and
Western Europe. After signing the Soviet–German
treaty, he visited Warsaw in December 1970 toconclude a Polish–German treaty. Television cam-eras recorded for all the world to see Brandt’s act
of repentance, when as the federal chancellor he
spontaneously sank to his knees before the mem-
orial to the half million Jewish victims of theWarsaw Ghetto. The gesture graphically symbol-ised the new Germany and its acceptance of
responsibility for the Nazi past. A four-power
agreement over Berlin (September 1971), a treaty1THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC833

between the Federal Republic and the GermanDemocratic Republic (December 1972) andﬁnally a Czech–German treaty (December 1973)
completed the clutch of Eastern treaties.Visiting the German Democratic Republic inMarch 1970, Brandt laid the foundations for anew businesslike relationship. The Berlin Wall,constructed in 1961, had stemmed the haemor-
rhage of population loss from East Germany and
in this negative way had created a basis of forced
stability for nearly thirty years. But the masters of
the German Democratic Republic were alarmedat Brandt’s popularity. Even after the treaty wassigned, inter-German relations were far from
normal. The viability of the East German state
rested on Soviet support, specifically on the 
Soviet veto of union with the West German state. Brezhnev had, nevertheless, responded toBrandt’s overtures and forced the East German
party boss Ulbricht to reach agreements. Western
recognition of the Eastern settlements was worth
a great deal to the USSR in stabilising its holdover the East. The boost given to inter-Germantrade, in addition, supported the ailing Eastern
economies; Brandt’s Eastern policy also brought
international recognition and benefits for the
Federal Republic, chief among which was the
recognition by the Soviet Union of the perma-nence of the ties between the Federal Republicand West Berlin. Moreover, movement between
the two Germanies was eased.Brandt had thus extricated his country fromthe increasingly damaging Hallstein Doctrinewhereby the Federal Republic had cut off rela-tions with any state that recognised the German
Democratic Republic (except for the Soviet
Union). This had increasingly narrowed West
Germany’s room for manoeuvre; now the way
was open again for renewed trade and culturalrelations with Eastern and central Europe. Bytaking the initiative, the Federal Republic was
showing the world that it was no longer content
with its inferior status, an ‘economic giant but a
political dwarf’.Willy Brandt and his FDP partner WalterScheel also proclaimed a new era at home. Far-
reaching reforms were promised which would
deepen the attachment of every citizen to thedemocratic order. The perception of governmentby a remote elite, leaving the electorate eitheracquiescent or in open rebellion, was to be radi-
cally changed. The youth rebellion burnt itself
out; under Brandt’s guidance, the SDP became
more tolerant of its young socialists. He alsohoped to provide an umbrella under which viewsfrom left to right could all shelter, though more
often than not left and right fought each other
within the party. That was to remain the SPD’s
abiding problem, the price paid for the wide elec-
toral support necessary to establish itself as thesenior party of government.The Brandt government fell short of fulﬁllingits high aims at home. Between 1969 and 1975,
the business cycle had turned downwards and the
annual growth of the German economy fell from8 to 1 per cent, a fall that was particularly steepafter the huge rise in oil prices in 1973–4. The
‘economic miracle’ appeared to be over; the West
Germans could not escape the depression of the
1970s.Brandt’s successor was Helmut Schmidt, themost able SPD chancellor of the post-war years.
Practical, energetic and decisive in leadership, he
provided a vivid contrast to the idealistic and
emotional Brandt. But he did not suffer fools
gladly and he made many enemies, especiallyamong ideologues. His principle was to ﬁnd prag-matic solutions to existing problems and to get
things done. He inherited the downturn of the
economy and the consequences of the oil shock
– severe depression followed in 1974–5. TheSchmidt government managed to keep inﬂationbelow 6 per cent. To Germans inﬂation was akin
to original sin. But government measures to
encourage efficiency and competitiveness to
maintain full employment were only partially suc-
cessful; even so, unemployment was kept down tobetween 4 and 5 per cent. Falling economicgrowth did not permit grandiose social-reform
schemes to be realised, but budgetary cuts and
ﬁnancial rectitude kept the German economy in
much better shape than that of its neighbours.Schmidt, a ‘European’, recognised the interde-pendence of the Western world and worked in
close collaboration with the French president
Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.834WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
The Schmidt years were severely strained by an upsurge of terrorism. A prominent Germanindustrialist, Hans Martin Schleyer, was kid-

napped in 1977 and then murdered when
Schmidt refused to meet the terrorists’ demands.
It was just one of a series of abductions andmurders. That same year in October a Lufthansajet with eighty-six passengers was hijacked by
Arab terrorists to Mogadishu, where a specially
trained German force spectacularly freed the
victims. Fortunately, the wave of terrorism abated
without having turned the Federal Republic intoa police state.Schmidt’s period in ofﬁce required almost con-tinuous crisis management. In foreign affairs he
was particularly concerned about the rapid build-
up of Soviet missiles aimed at Western Europejust when the US and the Soviet Union hadreached an agreement on balancing their inter-
continental missiles. Schmidt saw two dangers:
either that the US might decouple from Europe
in the event of a nuclear threat, or, more likely,that a third world war would be fought inEurope. Then there would be nothing left of
Germany. Until the Soviet Union disarmed its
European missiles, the only response was to build
up Western missiles in Europe as a deterrent. But
Schmidt had a hard time getting President Carterto pay much attention to the issue.In December 1979, with Schmidt a leadingadvocate, NATO took the ‘dual track’ decision:
there would be a period of negotiation designed
to persuade the Soviet Union to withdraw itsEuropean missiles completely (the zero option) orto reduce them, and if this made no progress
NATO would respond by stationing US missiles
in Europe; the most dangerous of these, the
Pershing missiles, would be based in the Federal
Republic. The incoming Reagan administrationwas not keen on this deal, or any serious negoti-ations with the Soviet Union. Off-the-cuff
remarks by administration spokesmen that a
‘limited’ nuclear war in Europe was feasible made
the situation worse. Schmidt’s role and theNATO decision produced a powerful resurgenceof protest outside parliament and strong opposi-
tion within the party. But Schmidt persevered.
Reagan took up the zero option in November1981, without results. Two years later in 1983the US began its missiles build-up to match theRussian arsenal, thus setting out on a path that
led eventually to the Soviet–US treaty abolishing
intermediate- and short-range missiles, signed at
the Washington summit in December 1987 byReagan and Gorbachev. This success owed muchto Schmidt’s original clarity of vision, steadfast-
ness and courage in following an unpopular policy
that at the time was characterised as an irrational
twist to the dangerous nuclear-arms build-up.When Schmidt sought a renewal of his mandateas chancellor together with his coalition partner,the FDP, now led by Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the
foreign minister, in the general election of 1980,
he faced as the CDU/CSU candidate the able but
mercurial Strauss, whose right-wing politics thor-
oughly alarmed the liberal reformers. Although theeconomy showed no signs of improvement –
indeed, with rising inﬂation, rather the reverse –

the Schmidt coalition beat the CDU/CSU. The
SPD had held its share of the vote at 42.9 per cent,the FDP had increased its share to 10.6 per cent,and Strauss had lost votes compared to the
CDU/CSU’s results four years earlier. Schmidt
seemed set for a long period in ofﬁce, but his

health had been undermined, and the increasingly
uneasy coalition with the FDP ﬁnally fell apart in
1982. The economic situation had seriously de-teriorated throughout Western Europe. In the
Federal Republic unemployment rose to over 7 per
cent and the FDP was demanding cuts in govern-

ment spending on unemployment beneﬁt which
the SDP could not accept. The FDP now oncemore switched its support to the CDU/CSU, and
with Genscher’s support Helmut Kohl became
chancellor in October 1982.It was largely the economic situation that hadﬁnally beaten Schmidt, though the fault lay notwith his policies but with a world recession, whichactually affected the Federal Republic less badly
than its neighbours. At times of perceived eco-
nomic crisis the majority of the electorate turned
more conservative. Kohl won the 1983 election by a handsome margin. A new phase of CDU/CSU–FDP government began. Unemployment
rapidly increased as the coalition fought the reces-
sion with sound money policies, as the rest of1THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC835
Western Europe was doing. The most signiﬁcantfeature of the Federal Republic’s condition, how-ever, has proved to be its stability in difﬁcult times.
Unlike the Germans under Weimar, the vast
majority of today’s electorate have no wish for
radical change. The new SPD leader, Hans-JochenVogel, moved his party slightly to the left butfailed to capture the Green constituency. The new
protest party, the Greens, who made their debut
in 1979 and won an astonishing 5.6 per cent of
the vote, giving them twenty-seven seats in the
Bundestag, represent a mixture of left-wing causesand concern for the environment. They struck agenuine chord and on environmental issues con-
tinue to exert a wholesome inﬂuence, despite their
eccentric behaviour in and out of parliament and
their lack of unity. They have added a refreshingtouch to the rather staid and mature demo-cratic republic that West Germany has thankfully
become. Extremism failed to win sufﬁcient elec-
toral votes to gain any seats. Terrorism remained a
worrying feature of social life, but in one form or other it had become common throughoutWestern Europe, the Middle East and many
regions of the world.Kohl’s chief problem was to satisfy Franz JosefStrauss, his CSU coalition partner and prime 
minister of Bavaria, who on most social issuesstood well to his right. Genscher wished to retainthe Foreign Ministry and was to become almost
a permanent holder of the ofﬁce, but Strauss also
wanted to become foreign minister. In the end
Kohl got the upper hand and Strauss wasthwarted – but he had no other home to go to.The two issues dominating the administration
from 1983 to 1987 were the economy and East–
West relations, which centred on the stationing of
nuclear missiles in the Federal Republic to match
the Soviet build-up and, it was hoped, pave theway to comprehensive disarmament on bothsides. But for a while another unexpected polit-ical development, the Flick affair, overshadowed
politics at home and worryingly raised questions
about the health of Germany’s democracy. A
large group of companies was controlled by asenior manager of the Flick concern. He wasaccused of bribing the CDU, SPD and FDP
parties and individual politicians. The FDP 
economics minister Count Otto Lambsdorff had
to resign in June 1984, as did the chairman of 
the CDU and the speaker of the Bundestag afteraccusations of involvement. But, on the positiveside, economic recovery began in 1984 and con-
tinued steadily until 1987. Inﬂation fell to its

lowest rate in decades; in 1986 there was none at
all. Exports boomed and the trade surplus grewlarger. For the great majority in work all thispromised continued stable prosperity. But the
black spot was unemployment, which hardly
improved. Nine per cent of the workforce, more
than 2 million people, remained without a job.What was true of other Western countries wastrue of West Germany: even as the majority were
increasing their standards of living, a heteroge-
neous underclass was forming. These were the
‘classless’, below any recognisable class: immi-

grants who could find no place in Westernsociety, who were either unemployed or illegallyemployed at sweated wages, the mentally sick
without family ties, drug addicts and prostitutes,
some little more than children, haunting such
areas as Bahnhof Zoo in Berlin. Then there werethose sleeping rough in cardboard boxes, forexample under the arches of London’s Waterloo
railway station. Few were aggressive – the squat-
ters in Hafenstrasse in Hamburg were something
of an exception. In many cities unemployment
was unacceptably high, but the social climate of836WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968

the 1980s had grown altogether more harsh; economic health was the priority. Governments
encouraged enterprise and productivity in indus-try, and the devil catch the hindmost. So thesafety net was beginning to show large holes.Ecology, the health of the earth, became agrowing concern. In Western Germany especially,
a sizeable part of the community rebelled against
a society that put material interests above all elseand was therefore damaging the environment.There were ever more cars, and forests were dying
from acid rain. Governments began to take notice
and to discuss measures to reduce pollution. The
Chernobyl disaster in 1986 sensitised people tothe dangers of nuclear reactors. The Greens ben-eﬁted as the anti-nuclear party. There were violent
clashes between protesters and police at the sites
of two nuclear reactors being built at Wackersdorf
and Brokdorf. The government defended thenuclear-energy option, but this was really the endof nuclear expansion in West Germany. France,
meanwhile, took the opposite course.West Germany was characterised during theseyears by an altogether more active public ready to
join mass protests on issues that moved them. Theprotesters were no longer only young people andstudents, as they had been in the 1960s. It was a
welcome sign that Germans were no longer awed
by authority and bureaucracy, as they had been in
the bad old days of the 1930s. The Pershing mis-
siles based in Germany were the cause of continu-
ous and widespread protest. But Genscher’s
diplomacy maintained West Germany on a shady
path, keeping Franco-German relations in good
repair, behaving as good Europeans in the
European Community and particularly normalis-
ing relations with the East German regime. Whilereuniﬁcation remained the ofﬁcial line, few at that

time believed they would see it happen in their life-
time. So the West German government set itselfthe task of overcoming the unnatural divisions
caused by the Wall and concluded agreementwhich made travel between the two Germanieseasier. The East German regime was much aided
by the ﬂourishing trade with West Germany, which
also gave its neighbour large credits.With unemployment high, every legal effortwas made to stem the number of asylum-seekers,other than Germans from the East, wishing toenter the Federal Republic. The Gastarbeiterwerenot as welcome as before, and Turkish families
who had lived for years in West Germany were
encouraged to return by the offer of a federalgrant. Few took advantage of it.As election day in January 1987 approached,the Kohl administration could count on solid sup-
port from the electorate, which was enthused by
the expanding economy and prepared to overlookthe unemployment. Genscher was popular too; heenjoyed a reputation as a skilful and successful 
foreign minister who was covering more air-miles
than any of his predecessors. Kohl was rather
underrated, as it turned out, and was regarded as
stodgy, with an unfortunate ﬂair for putting hisfoot in it. That the television stations repeated his1985 Christmas address in 1986 by mistake
seemed a typical mishap. A more serious incident
occurred during Reagan’s visit in May 1985. To
mark the anniversary of the ending of the SecondWorld War, as a gesture of reconciliation the USpresident and the federal chancellor paid their
respects at a German military cemetery, but the
choice of Bittsburg was unfortunate, because it
contained many SS graves. There were protests,
and Reagan was embarrassed. Kohl made anothergaffe in 1987 when he likened Gorbachev’s pro-paganda to that of Joseph Goebbels. But in truth
these were really just minor embarrassments. No1THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC837

to its close.The election for the Bundestag in January1987 gave the CDU/CSU 223 seats and a 44.3per cent share of the votes, the FDP coalitionpartners secured 46 seats with 9.1 per cent of the
vote and the SPD 186 seats and 37 per cent of
the votes. The Greens advanced spectacularly
with 42 seats and 8.3 per cent of the votes; no
other party secured even 1 per cent of the vote.Support for extremist parties such as neo-Naziswas insignificant before unification. In 1989,
West Germany, on the occasion of the fortieth
anniversary of the foundation of the Federal
Republic could feel it was prosperous, mature,and that democracy was ﬁrmly established. Theycould look conﬁdently to the future unaware of
the problems that lay ahead.The years from 1987 to 1990 were dominatedby the question of the two Germanies and theirrelationship. It ended surprisingly with their sud-den reuniﬁcation (see Chapter 76). Kohl beneﬁt-
ted from the gratitude of the Germans in the east
who helped him to secure a convincing victory 
in the general election in December 1990.The derelict state of the new federal Länderinthe eastern half of Germany, an economy that hadalready faltered in its trade with the communist
bloc and then in 1990 was unable to meet
Western competition, a German workforce whose
productivity was low after decades of the com-munist command economy – all these created fardeeper problems for the Western half of Germanythan was anticipated by the Kohl government.Kohl had promised to revive the east withoutraising taxes. The DDR currency was exchanged,
within certain limits, on a ratio of one to one with
the sound West German mark. To do otherwise,
the Kohl government had feared, would havestimulated a mass migration to the prosperousWestern Länder. Aid had to be poured in speed-ily to narrow as quickly as possible the gap
between the standards of living, pay, salaries and
pensions between east and west.Even so, more than 300,000 Germans movedfrom the east to the west in the year after uniﬁ-
cation. The difﬁculties, the costs and the time 
it would take to raise the eastern economy to
Western, free-market standards were badly under-
estimated. Kohl’s forecast during the 1990 elec-tion campaign of ‘blossoming landscapes’ in theeast by 1994 was soon regarded as unlikely to be
fulﬁlled. His undertaking that ‘nobody after uni-
ﬁcation will be worse off’ was rapidly abandoned.Despite the billions of Deutsche Marks pouredinto the eastern Länderand despite efforts to pri-vatise state industries, the majority of Germans
living in the east continued to face severe prob-
lems. Material beneﬁts still lay in the future for 3
million workers, one-third of the workforce in the
east, who were unemployed or on special pro-grammes designed to mask the true extent ofunemployment. Disillusionment and frustration
led to growing support for extremist groups, even
for neo-Nazis. Anger was turned on the hapless
foreign asylum-seekers who had taken advantageof Germany’s hitherto generous immigration pro-visions – 190,000 had entered in 1990 and
250,000 in 1991. The ﬁre-bombing of hostels
and violent demonstrations shocked democratic
opinion in Germany and the West, but unem-
ployed eastern Germans continued to resent thehelp given to foreigners, which they claimeddeprived ‘fellow Germans’ of their due. After half
a century of brown and red dictatorships, this was
evidence of a distinct deﬁcit in ethical values.The number of foreign immigrants was actu-ally less than the number of ethnic Germans who had lived for generations in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe and had now migrated to
Germany. They had been encouraged in quite1THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC839

almost three-quarters of a million took advantage
of this opportunity. One of the consequences 
of recession and of pressure to enter the West wasthat efforts to halt the ﬂow began to play anincreasingly important role in German and in
West European politics.Former citizens of the DDR in the 1990s hadto make many painful adjustments before they
could expect living standards comparable withthose in the West. Some lessons were psycholog-ical, such as not waiting to be told what to do
but taking the initiative; others were more prac-
tical, such as adapting to the needs of the market,
working effectively to raise productivity and learn-ing the skills of market management. Anotherhurdle was to overcome the corruption of the
past, the evidence of which lay in twelve miles of
ﬁles in the former secret police (Stasi) archives.
These preserved denunciations by tens of thou-sands of informants who had reported on theirneighbours, employers, employees, teachers and
students. It was not easy to accept that the old
system could not be divided into the good (such
as the guarantee of employment) and the bad
(such as the Berlin Wall), that a government andsociety have to be judged as a whole. It was dif-ﬁcult for East Germans not to be resentful of the
West Germans who came over to patronise them
and fill the best managerial posts; and it was 
hard for them to have to wait for an indeﬁnitenumber of years for the promised land of plenty.Meanwhile in West Germany there was resent-
ment about the sacrifices necessitated by the
transfer of money to the east, the higher taxes and
high interest rates. The East Germans were
blamed for their own plight, for their unrealisticexpectations of achieving overnight what hadtaken the West Germans decades to accomplish.The shock to the economic system of pro-viding aid for 17 million East Germans was felt
throughout Europe. High interest rates sloweddown hopes of recovery in France, Britain and therest of the European Community. Germany could
no longer act as the powerhouse of trade and lift
the Community out of recession. Unemploymentin the Community was running at around 10 percent and in some countries was even higher in1992. Europe in the early 1990s was mired in
recession, instead of enjoying the expected ‘peace
dividend’ from the collapse of communism. The
former Soviet Union stood on the edge of an eco-nomic abyss. The enormous German effort totransform had begun to show results. Islands of
industrial revival as around Dresden are develop-
ing, but much of the eastern Länderare in a sorrystate, the young and enterprising moving west.
The east and west remain economically, socially,psychologically divided.For two generations Germany’s formula for pros-perity and stability has been to follow consensual
policies between three partners – the state, theemployer and the employee. Deliberately revers-ing the structure of the Nazi state with its slogan,
‘one country, one people, one leader’, post-war
Germany ensured that decision-making was dis-
tributed by a federal structure of checks and balances. This has made it difﬁcult to change fundamental polices such as rigid labour laws and
generous state beneﬁts, which place heavy bur-
dens on employers and tax-payers. Labour became
too expensive, so foreign workers were brought in
legally or on the black economy, investment intechnology to replace labour was increased, andproducts were manufactured outside Germany; all
these factors drove unemployment up to the high-
est levels since the 1950s. In 1997 the ﬁrst signs
of recovery became apparent. An artiﬁcially lowrate of exchange favouring exports helped Germanindustry to increase productivity, but even then
employment was slow to pick up. The bankrupt
eastern Länderof the former German Demo-cratic Republic were another German drain on
resources. Despite the transfer of over DM900 bil-lion of West German tax-payers’ money there arestill not enough modern factories and services to
provide work; unemployment is even higher in the
east than in western Germany, with more than 
one in seven out of work. Kohl’s vision of ‘ﬂour-ishing landscapes’ proved to be a sad delusion; thegap between east and west will not be closed until
well into the new millennium. In the face of all
these problems, German democracy has remained840WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
solid. The post-war racist excesses of extremistshave been conﬁned to a minority and condemnedby the majority.The Kohl era came to an end in 1998 aftersixteen years in power. Internationally they had
been years of achievement and success. Kohl wascredited with unifying Germany, gaining the trustof its Western allies and the Soviet Union, pre-
siding over a mature democracy. The Bundestag
elections saw the CDU and its Bavarian CSU
partners garner the gratitude of the population in
the east and substantially raise its vote in 1994.But over the next four years the Kohl chancellor-ship no longer looked unassailable. German
exports were suffering. The generous social pro-
visions, pension rights, protection of the workers,
the cost of subsidising the new easternLänder,were exacting their toll on the economy. Theeconomy was stagnant and unemployment rose to
4.2 million or about 11 per cent of the workforce.
Social welfare and unemployment payments were
generous. Germany was mindful of the lastWeimar years. Schröder campaigned in 1998promising to reduce unemployment from just
over four million by a modest half a million
during his period as chancellor. The CDU vote
fell especially precipitously in the eastern Länderwhere employment was exceptionally high, ex-communists and the SPD beneﬁted. There wasalso an alarming rise among the young for anti-
immigration racist neo-Nazis. Overall, the SPD 
in coalition with the Greens were able to form 
a coalition under Schröder with a convincingmajority in the Bundestag.Early on, Schröder appeared to be on target tomake good on his promise to reduce unemploy-
ment. The international value of the mark fell, orrather the euro declined in value. On 1 January1999 the Monetary Union began and Germansgave up their beloved stable mark. Kohl had
agreed to Germany joining and Schröder followed
through. The boost given to German exports by
this devaluation did not last. The problems werefundamental: inflexible labour, workers’ rightswere well protected and making them redundant
expensive for employers who were consequently
reluctant to risk taking on too many. The welfare
payments required high taxation; the unions were
powerful and went on strike when their wagedemands were not met. The unemployed did nothave to accept jobs that were of a lower kind than
what they had before. During the last years of
Weimar longer term unemployment meant dire
poverty and had paved the way for the Nazis.That was the ‘lesson’ learnt. But high taxes andsocial security were undermining German enter-
prise and the ability to adapt to change.Unemployment began to rise again. Theopposition accused Schröder of breaking hispromise to bring it down. In the autumn of 2002,with an election pending, unemployment had
climbed back to over 4 million. It looked as if the
SDP–Greens might well lose the general election
of 2002 in a close-run contest.Three events revived Schröder’s chances. Anastonishing scandal broke over the heads of theCDU and Kohl. The amount of money that could
be contributed to political campaigning was lim-
ited by law. In the 1990s, the party treasurer
admitted that large sums had been secretly con-tributed to party coffers by some businesses inreturn for favours. Kohl admitted knowing and
was implicated. A criminal investigation into
Kohl’s conduct began and was only ﬁnally halted
on his agreeing to pay a substantial ﬁne. Then dur-
ing the summer of 2002 the Elbe burst its banksand caused horrendous ﬂoods. Schröder was seeneverywhere in the affected regions, the concerned
and active chancellor. Proposed tax cuts were
postponed to help the stricken regions. The
opposing chancellor candidate Edmund Stoiberwas wrong-footed. Stoiber was prime minister ofBavaria and so in any case handicapped, but he
was also stiff and lacked charisma, unlike
Schröder. Finally there was the growing crisis with1THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC841

Iraq. Stoiber was diplomatic about Germany’slikely role, Schröder reﬂected the popular mooddeclaring that under no circumstances would
Germany join in any war against Saddam Hussein.When the elections were held in September,with the CDU/CSU previously neck-and-neckwith the SPD, both parties polled approximatelythe same votes, 38.5 per cent, but with the gains
the Greens made, the SPD/Green coalition had
survived.The popularity of Schröder was based on weakfoundations. The aura of his robust stand againstparticipating in the Iraq war could not outlast itsconclusion for long. Fences with the US needed
mending; especially with President Bush who
took Germany’s abandonment of the alliance per-
sonally. But Germany had demonstrated onceagain that the people overwhelmingly opposedany military action beyond its own frontiers. It
was reassuring for the rest of Europe how paciﬁc
the Federal German Republic had become, how
European minded though, thereby opening a gapwith Blair’s more realistic alignment with the US– but then Britain did not have to live down the
Second World War. Schröder’s headache at home
was how to get Europe’s biggest economy out of
stagnation. The backing of his own party, split
between the more centrists and left, is alwaysproblematical. At least he can count on thebacking of his coalition partner, the Greens. The
parliamentary majority of nine is dangerously
small if some SPD members of parliament choose
to abstain from backing the government. On theother hand, the small majority ensured more dis-cipline. The party does not wish to face another
election too soon which it would be likely to lose.During the previous summer of 2002 Schröderhad assigned to a group of experts the ‘Hartz
Commission’ – Peter Hartz at the time was thepersonnel director of Volkswagen – to come upwith recommendations on reform in the eco-
nomy. In the summer of 2003, the party backed
Schröder’s reform plan which abandoned hal-

lowed workers’ rights.Full unemployment pay would only be paid forone year instead of two years and eight months
and then lower welfare rates would apply; laying
off workers would be made just slightly easier,more ﬂexibility in rates of pay would be intro-duced. None of these changes are earth shattering;the unique industrial feature of co-determination
by workers and managers, however, was left in
place. Reforms pointed to a new direction of the
social compact of worker–employee relations and
social welfare entitlements provided by the statefor the people. The non-wage labour costs hadexceeded 40 per cent – too high in a competitive
international age, taxation was too steep and even
so the budget deﬁcit exceeded the 3 per cent limit
set by the European Union’s Growth and StabilityPact. To lower expenditure, health entitlementswould be pruned. Small independent businesses
based on craft skills would also ﬁnd it a little eas-
ier to establish themselves. There would be no
sharp shock treatment as the very name given to
the reforms ‘Agenda 2010’ revealed.It is all probably too little too late. Germanindustry and services will need to ﬁnd the cre-
ativity in a recovered world market to pull
Germany out of its low growth rate and reduce
unemployment to acceptable levels below 5 percent, a reduction that in 2005 could only bedreamt about. Yet standards of living remain
among the highest in Europe. Germany is not a
country in crisis and government remains stable
and democratic. The neo-Nazis remained on thefringe rejected by the overwhelming majority ofpeople. The 2004 Länderelections starkly con-ﬁrmed the continuing east–west split despite the
1.25 trillion euros transfer to build up the east
since 1990. Unemployment and discontent is
high beneﬁting extreme parties there on the leftand right. A long and painful road of welfare andlabour law reforms lies ahead to make Germany
more competitive.842WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968

In Italy, the protest and turbulence of 1968 werenot conﬁned to student groups or to a rebellion
of youth, but spawned in their aftermath an
upsurge in the militancy of the industrial workers.The divisions and weaknesses of the trade unionmovement were overcome by local bargaining and
by the development of factory organisations – the
factory councils. The Marxist student-protest
movement struck real roots among the workers,
unlike in West Germany and France, whereprotesting students met with little sympathy fromworking people, whose taxes gave students time
for their sit-ins and endless debates; in Britain,
student protest and influence were negligible
outside the universities, prompting tolerantamusement or perhaps criticism of the authoritiesfor allowing such disruption. In Italy the protests
and the breakdown of order were far more serious.The ‘hot autumn’ of 1969 saw the spread ofmany strikes, supporting demands for higher pay
and better working conditions. The Italian peoplecould no longer be easily led; there was a loss ofrespect for institutions and for the political lead-
ership that extended through all parties and tra-
ditions. Labour legislation the following year, in
1970, gave the trade unionist more power. TheItalian economy began to suffer from characteris-tic stress: inﬂation took off in the mid-1970s; 
the sudden increase in oil costs hit the Italian
economy hard; workers’ wages outpaced produc-
tivity; the agricultural south lagged ever morebehind the industrial north. The expansion of theItalian economy slowed. Although the averageannual growth in GNP in the 1970s still exceeded
3 per cent, it gyrated wildly from year to year.The economic upheavals and the social fermentwere reﬂected in the instability of governmentsfrom 1968 to 1976. The Christian Democrats
hardly changed in electoral strength, but internal
divisions and the continued political jockeying
among coalition partners, who agreed on little
beyond the need to keep the communists out, pro-
duced one crisis government after another. Thetrend was to form centre-left alignments, and the
contemporary legislation reflected this, as did 
the distancing of politics from the demands of the
Church, as Italy became increasingly secularised.In 1970 a civil divorce law ﬁnally passed through
parliament. Effective implementation, however,
required a referendum. The Church continued to
oppose divorce vehemently, and so did the leader-

ship of the Christian Democrats, but when the ref-

erendum was ﬁnally held in 1974 a majority of theItalian population backed divorce. Women’s rightstoo gradually made headway in Italy in the 1970s
and the 1980s, as elsewhere in the Western world.
And youth gained more inﬂuence, with the voting

age reduced from twenty-one to eighteen in 1974.In another attempted reform of the Italianpolitical landscape, decentralisation and regional
autonomy were taken further. The ﬁrst regional
elections of 1970 brought only limited progress;
they nevertheless made possible communist par-ticipation in local government without admitting1Chapter 72CONTEMPORARY ITALY
PROGRESS DESPITE POLITICScommunists into central government. The Com-munist Party provided comparatively efficientadministration in the ‘red’ central regions of
Emilia Romagna, Umbria and Tuscany, when
contrasted with the corruption of the other
parties. The communist response to welfare andenvironmental needs spurred theChristianDemo-
crats and other parties to compete on these issues.
But political bargaining and central power in
Rome nevertheless predominate, inhibiting the
development of genuine regional autonomy as
intended by the Italian constitution. What theregional system has not achieved is a levelling outbetween the wealthiest and the poorest parts of
Italy. In 1978 against a gross national product 
per head for Italy as a whole of 100, the poorest
region – Calabria in the southern toe – achievedonly just over half the average (53) and thewealthiest – the Val d’Aosta in the north-west
corner three times as much (157), while indus-
trial northern Italy has more than twice the GNP
of the south. Italy remains divided.There is a darker side to recent Italian history.The grass-roots political militancy produced a
fanatical extremist element, small in number but
great in their impact because of the ruthless ter-
rorist tactics they employed; the best known were
the Red Brigades. Bombs were set off in railwaytrains in Milan, in Bologna and elsewhere, withconsiderable loss of life. Their purpose was to
destroy the social and democratic political struc-
ture. The most spectacular Red Brigade terrorist
action was the March 1978 kidnapping of AldoMoro, the leader of the Christian DemocraticParty, when he was on his way to parliament. The
terrorists demanded the release from prison of
thirteen of their companions. The government
held ﬁrm, despite heart-rending messages from
Moro. Eight weeks later Moro’s corpse was leftin the trunk of a car in the centre of Rome. Thegeneral revulsion was so great that it strengthened
rather than weakened Italian democracy. But ter-
rorism continued, reaching a horriﬁc climax in
August 1980 when bombs were set off inBologna railway station, which was crowded withtourists. Eighty-four people were killed.Italy also experienced common West Europeanproblems – it was no longer backward, a nationapart. For a long time Italians had had to emi-grate to more prosperous countries to ﬁnd work.Now Africans were coming to Italy, and, as in the
rest of Western Europe, the stream of immigrants
– often performing menial functions for poor pay
which Italians no longer wished to take on –created multi-ethnic communities in the citieswith their attendant problems of exploitation, dis-
crimination, poverty, crime and tension. At the
general election of 1976 the Communist Party,
now led by Enrico Berlinguer, hoped to overtake
the Christian Democrats, since Berlinguer’s opendeﬁance of Moscow and his leading role in therise of Eurocommunism had enhanced the party’s
standing. It came close to succeeding.The communists demanded full acceptancewithin the political system, particularly inclusion ina government of national unity. They were sup-
ported by parties of the left. Italy’s NATO partners
were thoroughly alarmed and warned the Christian
Democratic leadership against such a step. To avert
the danger that no government would be found,that Italy would be virtually ungovernable becausethe Christian Democrats could form no coalition
with the non-communist left which would give
them a majority, agreement was reached with the
communists in 1976 that they would support a
minority Christian Democrat government inreturn for consultation. This involvement of thecommunists in the government of the country,
which was called the ‘historic compromise’, came
to an end after the 1979 election, when the
Christian Democrats formed a new coalition gov-
ernment with the non-communist left.Widespread corruption and inﬂuence-peddlingcontinues to mar the workings of Italian democ-
racy. Links between Christian Democrats and the
Maﬁa in Sicily have proved highly embarrassing
to the party. The scandal of the freemason lodgeknown as P2, which broke in 1981, was bothalarming and sensational. The lodge formed a
secret society of nearly 1,000 members drawn
from political, administrative and military elites,
including members of the government andextending to links with high finance and thecriminal underworld.Later investigation uncovered another murkysecret underground organisation called Operation844WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
Gladio. It was originally set up early in the ColdWar as a secret military group to move into actionto counter a communist takeover of Italy. Its
functioning was known to successive Italian prime
ministers, including Giulio Andreotti, and revela-
tions by the judiciary in 1990 caused the rulingpolitical elite considerable embarrassment. Itseems to have become an extreme-right terrorist
organisation which attempted to incite anti-left
reactions. It was rumoured that Gladio was
responsible for a number of bombings in the
1970s and 1980s, including the explosion atBologna railway station. The theory was thatGladio intended thereby to undermine the left,
whose terrorists were blamed for the outrages. If
so, Gladio was as much out of control as the Red
Brigades. What is clear is that Gladio belonged tothe unacceptable side of Italian politics. Yet it wasa healthy sign that there were other politicians,
civil servants and men with responsibilities in the
regions who were willing to bring corruption to
light. The mass trials of Maﬁosi in Palermo in the
mid-1980s attested to their courage and deter-mination. The ﬁght against corruption had notbeen won, but at least it was being waged.With a period of political stability, reinforced bythe ﬁnancial reforms of Bettino Craxi, the ﬁrst

Socialist to become prime minister, which heachieved in 1983 with majority Christian Demo-crat backing, the Italian economy was nursed 
back to better health. Inﬂation fell to an acceptable

5 per cent and unemployment fell too. But the
fundamental problems of Italy remained. The
north–south gap was increasing; northern industrywas geared to, and competitive within, WesternEurope; the regions south of Rome, despite thirtyyears of development aid, remained backward and
uncompetitive, with a few remarkable exceptions.
The Abruzzo region, west of Rome, with a popu-

lation of 1.2 million, was no longer tied to poorfarming, but had developed modern industry and tourism. Was that a harbinger of things to
come? There was little sign of this in Calabria,
Sicily or Sardinia. Twenty million Italians lived in
the south in the early 1990s; one in ﬁve was unem-

ployed. Thirty-six million Italians lived in thenorthern half, where about one in fourteen wasunemployed and standards of living were almost
twice as high. As Western Europe integrated in 
the 1990s, the south could be left increasingly
behind. If Italian government remained unstable –and the auguries were not good – the mismanage-
ment of public resources, the growth of the huge
public debt and the inefﬁciency of an army of

bureaucrats would carry on unimpeded, and inter-

est groups would continue to be paid off from state
funds. It was a considerable burden, mainly carriedby the efﬁcient, large-scale private industry of thenorth. Without political reform, all these problems
would intensify.Craxi managed to remain in ofﬁce until August1987, just short of an unprecedented four years.In the election held that month he slightlyincreased his percentage of the vote at the expense
of the Christian Democrats, who nonetheless
gained twice as many votes as the Socialists. The
alliance of the Socialists and Christian Democrats
under the premiership of Craxi had been one of1CONTEMPORARY ITALY845

pure electoral convenience rather than commonaims or mutual trust. It was replaced by an uneasyﬁve-party coalition headed by a Christian Demo-
crat and including Craxi’s Socialists. March 1988
saw another administration formed by a Christian
Democratic premier in increasingly uneasy part-nership with Craxi. This administration succeededin passing the long-overdue abolition of secret
voting in the Chamber on most issues. When in
March 1989, Craxi withdrew his party from the
coalition, the Christian Democrat prime minister
resigned. It took nine weeks to ﬁnd a new pre-mier. In July 1989, the veteran politician GiulioAndreotti became prime minister for the sixth
time, leading the forty-ninth post-war administra-
tion, yet another ﬁve-party coalition, including
Craxi’s Socialists. Thus the stability of governmentcontinued to rest on the cooperation of theChristian Democrats and Socialists, which allowed
Craxi pretty much to name his conditions.A feature of Italian politics unique in WesternEurope was the relatively small change in theshares of the vote on left and right. Majorities inparliament could at times be secured only by strik-
ing bargains with the communists, who were thus
able to inﬂuence the national government without
being part of it. In the regions a Socialist–
communist alliance was not unusual, so the com-munists were not entirely excluded from the polit-ical coalitions that ran Italy. In the early 1990s the
Christian Democrats had been in power as the
largest partner in coalition governments without
interruption since the liberation. Changes of pol-icy had, nevertheless, occurred, changes whichroughly mirrored the political swings in the rest 
of Western Europe. In Italy, however, they were
the result not of governments changing hands
between opposite parties, but of the parties them-
selves changing direction. Party policies werepragmatic. The Communist Party had alteredcourse; the Socialist Party was hardly ‘socialist’;
the Christian Democrats did not always follow
policies to the right of centre – all this made
changes of direction in government possible. The1990s brought old problems once more grimly tothe surface: the web of Maﬁa corruption and drug
trafﬁcking had spread to the north. The whole of
Italy was shocked when in the spring and summerof 1992 two of Italy’s most prominent Maﬁajudges were murdered. Organised crime appearedto be beyond the control of the government.
Corruption scandals further alienated the people
from the self-serving politicians. The huge deﬁcit
caused by government spending had doubled thecountry’s debts during the 1980s. At the sametime, Italy’s infrastructure – its railways, its roads,
its telecommunications – was crumbling.Somehow Italian politics had managed to defygravity in the past. A founding member of the
European Community, Italy enthusiasticallybacked the monetary and political union envis-aged by the Maastricht Treaty, but its parlous
economic condition made the idea of conver-

gence with the economies of France and Germany
within a few years difﬁcult to take seriously.The general election in 1992 weakened thefour-party governing coalition, leaving it with so
small a majority that it could not hope to push
through any reforming measures. As a result,
Giuliano Amato, the deputy leader of the SocialistParty, was asked by the president to form theﬁfty-ﬁrst Italian government. Amato was faced
with the problem of gaining parliamentary
approval for necessary ﬁnancial reforms, to cut
welfare and pension payments. There was no
other way to meet Italy’s burgeoning deﬁcit. InSeptember 1992 it suffered the indignity, incompany with Britain, of having to devalue and
leave the Exchange Rate Mechanism. In the early
1990s Italy seemed to have reached a turning
point. Political scandal, Maﬁa criminality and aneconomic debacle threatened a continuousnational crisis unless fundamental reforms were
carried through, and not just talked about.The criminal investigations begun by membersof the judiciary in Milan in 1992 involving Craxi
snowballed in 1993 to reveal endemic politicaland ﬁnancial corruption throughout the upperechelons of local and national government and in
commerce. Even Andreotti, the veteran political
survivor, seven times prime minister, was accused
of being in the service of the Maﬁa. The collapseof the Cold War in any case altered the shape ofItalian politics. Government coalitions formed
around the Christian Democrats and Socialists

d’être. So many party leaders, ministers anddeputies were touched by scandal and accusationsof corruption moreover, that the political game
simply could not continue as before. The elec-
torate was disillusioned; business wished to end
government waste; the people of the northbaulked at subsidising the south; unemploymentran at over 10 per cent. The demand for political
change thus became irresistible.Reforms were passed in time for the March1994 national elections. Three-quarters of the
seats were allocated to ‘ﬁrst-past-the-post’ winners
in constituencies and one quarter on the basis ofthe old proportional representation but with a 
new 5 per cent hurdle. The politicians of the estab-

lished parties rushed to put on new clothes. The
Communist Party, phoenix-like, re-emerged as theDemocratic Party of the Left (PDS); a minority of the old orthodox party now called them-
selves Reconstructed Communists; the disgraced
Christian Democrats turned to its pre-fascist past
and fought the election as the Popular Party ofItaly; but there were also entirely new forces suchas the Northern League led by Umberto Bossi, a
regional party wishing to break up the centralised
state and demanding the right to keep the wealth
generated by industry in the region; it had already
made a striking debut in the elections of 1992. Thereal phenomenon of 1994, however, was the emer-
gence of an anti-socialist, free-market, right-wing
party, the brainchild of a charismatic business
tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, owner of three national
TV channels and the Milan football club whosebattle cry, forza, inspired the name of his party,Forza Italia. Formed only a few weeks before the
March 1994 elections to stop the expected band-

wagon of the left, Berlusconi scored an unprece-

dented victory. The elections were fought in
alliance groupings of the left as the ‘Progressives’,the right as the ‘Freedom Alliance’, and the centre,‘Pact for Italy’.Italian political traditions are deeply ingrainedand electoral reform will not change them
overnight. Bribery and patronage are endemic;non-payment of taxes is a sport for the self-employed. What appeared to be a breakthrough
when Berlusconi with his new Forza Italia Party
won the elections of 1994 proved illusory.Predictably, Bossi’s Northern League broke upthe coalition, later becoming more extreme indemanding ‘independence’ for the north. Basic
problems – the hole in public ﬁnance, disparities
of regional wealth, taxation and welfare reform –
remain. The technocrat caretaker administrationhad no time during its brief period of officebetween January 1996 and the elections of April
1996 to achieve much. The elections, however,
did mark a change when Romano Prodi, who
headed a centre-left Olive Tree coalition, defeated
Berlusconi’s Freedom Alliance. For the ﬁrst timethe new government included ‘reformed’ commu-nists; but it also had to rely on the votes of the
unreconstructed ones.The fundamental change in politics has notjust been the demise of the corrupt old ChristianDemocrat Party but the entry of the communists,who continue to enjoy strong electoral support in
government. Although they do not have a two-
party system, alternative and opposing coalitions
can now provide the electorate with a real choice:a gain for democracy.In Italy the need to qualify for monetary unionalso topped the political agenda. Its reputation for
unsound ﬁnance has been strenuously repudiated
and reforms have been driven through with
determination. Stringent campaigns were foughtagainst those prominent politicians and industrial-ists who were involved in bribery and corruption
scandals. With the formation of the centre-left
Olive Tree coalition government in May 1996 the
administration of Prime Minister Romano Prodialso brought some political stability to the countryafter a turbulent decade that saw the emer-
gence of Silvio Berlusconi’s new right-wing Forza
Italia movement and Umberto Bossi’s separatist
Northern League. Prodi wanted to tackle the
roots of Italy’s deﬁcit spending, the over-generouswelfare payments, especially pensions, and thebloated civil service and bureaucracy, in order to
qualify for the European Monetary Union. But
this centre-left coalition, which included the
reformed communists, also needed the support ofthe Marxist rump communists, who had formedthe Communist Refoundation Party. The 1997
budget created tensions but the Marxists were
reluctant to risk another general election in which1CONTEMPORARY ITALY847
they might lose support. With the beneﬁt of somecreative accounting, Italy was judged to have metthe Maastricht criteria and so was able to join the
Monetary Union in 1999.The Olive Tree coalition ousted Prodi in 1998and in quick succession had three new leaders asprime minister – in October 1998 MassimoD’Aleima, followed by Giuliano Amato, who was
removed in time for the former mayor of Rome,
Francesco Rutelli, to contest the May 2001 general
election. With all those changes it looked like the
old politics of musical chairs. As for Berlusconi, theelectorate did not appear too much concernedwith charges of corruption in running his media
business empire or in the conﬂict of interests that

would arise when a prime minister controls the
main news channels, three national TV stations, alarge publishing house, the AC Milan footballteam, a major newspaper and ﬁnancial services. A

self-made billionaire, he promised success in the
handling of government. There was a reaction
against Italy’s old political elite in favour of a mav-
erick business tycoon who promised to cure Italy’sills, though it was far from clear how he could
make good providing better services while spend-

ing less – the classic conservative appeal. The elec-

torate gave Berlusconi’s own party solid support in
the Freedom Alliance he formed. His coalitionpartners in the centre-right administration werethe same as in his ill-starred short government of
1994 – the populist rhetorically extremist leaders
of the Northern League Umberto Bossi and
Gianfranco Fini’s Social Movement with echoes ofthe old Fascist Party. But Bossi’s poor showing inthe election no longer gave him the leverage to
bring down the government as in 1994, and Fini
was doing his best to shed the lingering fascist
image.The big reforms Berlusconi promised remain tobe enacted. Nothing much changed. The Italianbudget remained out of skelter, the looming pen-
sion crisis has not been tackled, economic growth
in difﬁcult global conditions was low.In the European Union, Italy became moreassertive, but Berlusconi did not risk taking con-ﬂict too far. At home too he has avoided con-frontations with vested interests. His careful
middle way was well illustrated by his handling of
Italy’s position in the Iraq war. Italian public
opinion as elsewhere in continental Europe was
strongly opposed to the war. Berlusconi maskedhis own pro-American feelings declaring noItalian combat forces would be sent while quietly
permitting the US to use Italian bases. On the
home front, Berlusconi was dogged by allegations
of business corruption going back to the 1980s.As a serving prime minister he had been forcedto defend himself before magistrates in Milan on
the very eve of taking over the revolving presi-
dency of the European Union in July 2003.
National pride would not allow that. A new 
bill was passed freeing Berlusconi from prosecu-tion while prime minister but the constitutionalcourt in the following year struck down the 
bill. Unprecedented for a serving prime minister,
Berlusconi at the close of 2004 once again
became the defendant in a criminal corruptiontrial, accused of bribing judges twenty yearsearlier, before he had entered politics. He was
acquitted; a political crisis was averted. Before he
leaves ofﬁce, Italians will have tired of the legal
dramas and will judge him on the success of his
administration.848WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968

(centre–right ﬁve-party coalition)Whatever the rest of the world may have expected,the British people did not spend much energy
grieving over their lost empire or hankering after
past glories. Apart from crises in which Britain wasdirectly involved, such as Berlin in 1948, Suez in1956 and the Falklands in 1982, little of what was
occurring in the outside world distracted them
from domestic concerns. Their attention was over-
whelmingly ﬁxed on the economy at home, on
wage bargaining and wage restraint, on the tradeunions and their growing power, on whetherBritain could keep pace with, and later whether it
could catch up with, the spectacular progress of its
West European neighbours, above all on whether
people felt conﬁdent about better times ahead.These issues decided elections. Chancellors of theexchequer had to develop policies that would cre-
ate the right economic conditions and the right
mood on election day. Labour and the Con-

servatives attacked each other’s economic policies,
though in practice a consensus prevailed on manyaspects of domestic policy at least until 1979: tosustain full employment, to aid declining industry
and to promote economic growth. There was, of
course, a price to pay; over-manning meant low
productivity, sheltered industries became lesscompetitive, and steeply progressive taxation tomeet the costs of these policies had to be exacted.
Britain slipped further behind, its standard of liv-
ing advancing more slowly than that of its West
European neighbours. Yet economic statisticsalone do not accurately reﬂect the quality of life.Home ownership, for example, had spread to rel-atively low-income groups, much further than on
the European continent.Government policies sought a surge in pro-ductivity, growth in manufacturing exports and areduction in imports of consumer goods from
cars to refrigerators, from washing machines to
television sets, which were coming to be regarded
as basic requirements. If these needs could be met
from production at home and if Britain couldexport enough to pay for its necessary imports,the economy could develop healthily. Progress
was made but it ran into periodic crises, and what
became known as stop–go economic management
began to typify treasury policy.Up to the early 1950s the British economy wasstill holding its own in manufacturing, and the
city of London was contributing valuable ‘invisi-
ble’ earnings by providing banking and insurance
services. Western Europe was still recovering from
the war, but the overall trend is made very appar-ent by the statistics set out in the table below.The British economy suffered from anotherproblem. The average rate of 2 to 3 per cent
annual growth hides large variations between the
fast-growth ‘go’ years and the slow-growth ‘stop’periods. The average annual growth rates ofindustrial production in the ‘go’ years of 1953 to
1955, 1959 to 1960 and 1962 to 1964 were a
respectable 5.8 per cent annually, but the ‘stop’
periods in between, 1955 to 1958, 1960 to 1962and 1964 to 1966, raised production by an1Chapter 73HOW TO MAKE BRITAIN MORE
PROSPEROUSCONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR REMEDIES
annual percentage of only 0.9 per cent. Duringthe 1970s and early 1980s the gap between theperformance of Britain and its neighbours in 
manufacturing grew rather than decreased, and 
its manufacturing output fell steeply, creating
large-scale unemployment.In relative terms, Britain was not doing well;but people compared their living standards with
earlier years, not with those of their continental
neighbours. During the Conservative years from
1957 to 1964 these standards were rising signiﬁ-
cantly, with improved housing, more effectivesocial services, a National Health Service thatremoved ﬁnancial worries from illness, higher real
wages, better education and better provision for
the old-age pensioner. The blessings of full
employment came to be regarded as the norm.There were more vacancies for the skilled and newopenings in the professions and the civil service.
More university places and increased provision of
grants made it easier to cross class barriers, espe-
cially for the ex-servicemen. Complete equality ofopportunity did not exist any more then than itdoes now, but there were no insuperable barriers
for the talented, the hardworking and the highly
motivated. Compared with before the war, Britain
had become a much better country to live in.Harold Wilson’s years as prime minister from1964 to 1970 were remarkable for new thinkingand experimentation to improve Britain’s perfor-
mance in a mixed economy, combining state and
private enterprise. Wilson believed that govern-
ment had to become more interventionist and tocopy the indicative planning that had proved sosuccessful in Germany and France. Central to this
aim was the attempt to establish a link between
higher wages and productivity. Prices and incomes
were compulsorily regulated by a government-
appointed board set up in 1965. In March 1966Wilson went to the country and succeeded in mas-sively increasing Labour’s majority. But the fol-lowing year the economy ran into severe trouble,and sterling was belatedly devalued. The attempt
to coordinate national economic planning with a
Department of Economic Affairs (headed by the
deputy Labour leader George Brown) was inruins. Britain’s foreign and military commitments‘east of Suez’ were cut in 1968. Wilson extended
state control and renationalised steel, a move
which in the long term cost the taxpayer dear in
subsidies. Low wages and workers’ discontent led
to many strikes. With the Labour Party ﬁnanciallydependent on the trade unions, the governmentcould not put in place effective legislation to curb
their power, which was unbalancing industrial
relations. That was the biggest hole in Labour’s
planning for a more efﬁcient Britain. Direct stateinvestment was not always successful, though pri-vate industry did not always choose the right path
either. The merger of British car manufacturers
into Leyland only accelerated the downward path
of this once highly competitive and successfulindustry. Wilson also tried to obtain Britain’sentry into the European Economic Community,
but was blocked a second time when de Gaulle
vetoed the application in November 1967.Labour paid particular attention to policiesdesigned to equalise opportunities for all Britain’syoung people. Schools were reorganised intomixed-ability ‘comprehensives’; more successful
was Labour’s continuing commitment to the
expansion of university and higher education ﬁrst
launched by the Conservatives. But the continu-ing ﬂaw was the lack of attention given to techni-cal education: it was not accorded an academic
esteem equal to that of other subjects – which it
has long received in Germany, for instance. The
privileged private ‘public schools’ were not abol-
ished and so continued to underpin a class-basedsociety, though mobility between the classes did850WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968

increase signiﬁcantly. The middle classes widenedand so did middle-class culture. More youngpeople aspired to own a house rather than rent; by
1970 half of all houses were owner-occupied. In
1961 only 4 million Britons travelled abroad for
their holidays; in 1984 15 million did so. Washingmachines, televisions and cars were no longer thepreserve of the few. Women began to insist on
equal rights: the contraceptive pill gave them full
control over their sexuality. Despite continuing
hardships, especially in the north of England and
Northern Ireland, the 1960s and 1970s were yearsof expanding horizons and growing freedom.Among the dark areas were inner-city neglect,unemployment, drugs and racial tension aggra-
vated by youth unemployment. Second- and
third-generation immigrants, nurtured on civilrights and protest movements, were not as willingto accept discrimination as their parents and
grandparents had been. The race riot in London’s
Notting Hill in 1958 was a foretaste of what was
to come: Bristol, Brixton, Liverpool (Toxteth) inthe summer of 1981 and Handsworth in 1985,drew attention to the problems of densely popu-
lated, deprived city areas. In the 1970s and 1980s
a new phenomenon arose to threaten the strong
social cohesion of Britain, that of whole groups
becoming alienated from society, such as theunskilled black and white youths, whose prospectsof employment had become remote and who now
sought expression in an alternative society while
relying on welfare handouts. To them the politi-
cians in Westminster were distant and unreal. Butyouth unemployment in the 1970s and 1980s wasnot just a British problem – it plagued Western
European countries. Although the existence of a
black economy should be taken into account, the
ofﬁcial statistics tell a shocking story of waste and
frustration.Another black spot was Northern Ireland. Thepartition of Ireland in 1920–1 after the bloody
civil war was never fully accepted by the south,
while the Protestant majority in the six counties
of Ulster in the North insisted on the mainte-nance of union with Britain. The Catholic minor-ity in Ulster was discriminated against and
deprived of political inﬂuence. A separate gov-
ernment and parliament at Stormont, underWestminster’s ultimate authority, allowed dis-
criminatory practices to continue which wouldnot have been tolerated in the rest of Britain. The
Irish Republican Army, or IRA, which aims to
coerce the north into a uniﬁed Ireland, has suc-
cessfully resisted the Protestant-dominated RoyalUlster Constabulary, or RUC. Economic declineaggravated the conﬂict. IRA militancy was revived
by the Provisional IRA offshoot, and Protestant
militancy by the formation of the Ulster Defence
Association. In 1969 British troops were sent to
Ireland to reinforce the police, but the number ofbombings and sectarian killings rapidly increased.With ﬁrearms on the street, calamitous mis-takes were bound to occur. The worst was Bloody
Sunday, 30 January 1972, when British troops
opened fire on a banned Catholic civil-rightsmarch in Londonderry, killing sixteen. IRA ter-rorists meanwhile carried out a series of vicious
murders: on 21 July 1973 twenty bombs indis-
criminately killed eleven people in Belfast; in
1979 Lord Mountbatten and eighteen soldierswere the victims of attacks. By 1992 some 3,000civilians and soldiers had lost their lives since 
the ‘Troubles’ began. Catholic and Protestant
Church leaders have condemned the killing of
innocent people, but in vain. For a whole gener-
ation of youngsters violence became the norm.The efforts of British governments to ﬁnd a solu-tion failed, even though the province was directly
subordinated to Westminster in March 1972,
under the day-to-day control of a secretary of
state for Northern Ireland.Attempts to achieve cooperation betweenLondon and Dublin made some progress, but they
did not end the cycle of violence. The ﬁrst attempt

was the December 1973 Sunningdale agreement,
which proposed Catholic–Protestant power-
sharing in the province and the handing back ofcontrol to a Northern Irish executive. But therewas a backlash from Protestant workers and the
agreement was buried. The middle ground of
Catholic–Protestant relations – represented, for
example, by the non-sectarian Alliance Party – hasremained too weak. Hopes of cooperation bet-
ween London and Dublin were revived by the
signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in Novem-

ber 1985, by Margaret Thatcher and Garret1HOW TO MAKE BRITAIN MORE PROSPEROUS851
Fitzgerald. But Protestant opponents in NorthernIreland denounced the idea of giving Dublin anyrole in Northern Irish politics as ‘treachery’,
although the government of the Republic of
Ireland had recognised that Irish unity could be
brought about only by the consent of the majorityin Northern Ireland. The agreement has also beencondemned by the IRA and its political wing Sinn
Féin. Nevertheless, the cooperative institution cre-

ated by the agreement, the Intergovernmental
Conference, continues to function, even though its
practical achievements have been sparse.Despite the difﬁculties the Wilson government hadexperienced economically from 1967 to 1969,
Labour was expected to beat the Conservatives
when the prime minister called the election forJune 1970. To most people’s surprise, the Conser-vatives won, and their leader Edward Heath was 
in 10 Downing Street. Heath, a grammar school
boy, represented a break with the tradition of
grand Tory leaders of the Macmillan and Homeschool. He had a good record as a minister, andalthough he had failed to overcome de Gaulle’s
veto of British entry into the EEC, his handling of
the negotiations from 1961 to 1963 had earned
him respect.Now it was Heath’s and the Conservatives’turn to try to cure the ‘British disease’ of eco-nomic inertia. The remedy adopted was a market-
oriented approach: a vigorous Britain would
diminish government subsidies and welfare and
reward hard work and enterprise; taxation was tobe reduced, the frontiers of the state rolled back;wage control was abandoned. Social programmes
were cut, including free school milk. But the doc-
trine of non-state intervention and bale-outs of
industry was quickly reversed, the U-turn begin-
ning in February 1971 when Rolls-Royce wasrescued and taken into public ownership. Theundoing of the Heath government was its bitter
clash with the trade unions. The restriction of
their rights by the Industrial Relations Act in
1971 coincided with an economic downturn. In1973, the rise in oil prices made the situation stillworse. The Heath government now resorted to
draconian price and wage controls. Government
intervention even came to exceed that of Labour.In February 1974 the miners went on strikeagainst the government wages policy. That winterof gloom the lights literally went out and indus-
try was forced to work a three-day week. The gov-
ernment’s confrontation with the miners was
thoroughly mishandled and when Heath called anelection in February 1974 on the issue of ‘Whogoverns Britain?’ he narrowly lost.The major achievement of Heath’s administra-tion had been Britain’s entry at last into the
Common Market in 1973. In this critical area of
policy Heath and Wilson were agreed, thoughboth were faced with considerable oppositionwithin their own parties on the issue. Wilson’s dif-
ﬁculties were the more serious. In October 1971
the Labour Party Conference had voted against
joining the EEC. It was, therefore, fortunate thatit was under a Conservative government that theterms Heath had secured were submitted to the
Commons for approval.The terms of accession allowed Britain a tran-sitional period of adjustment for a maximum ofsix years. By then, with few exceptions, its foodprices would rise above world prices as duties
would be imposed on food imported from the
Commonwealth and the US. The formula for cal-
culating Britain’s contribution to the common
budget created such a disproportionate burdenthat Margaret Thatcher had to negotiate itsreduction, amid much acrimony, during her ﬁrst
administration (1979–83).Support for and opposition to ‘joining Europe’aroused great passions, though more so inParliament than in the country as a whole, wherea majority were simply in favour of efforts to ﬁnd
solutions to Britain’s problems. The opposition in
Parliament could marshal powerful arguments:
the loss of sovereignty and submission to the
bureaucracy of Brussels; the disadvantage toBritain, with its small and efﬁcient agriculturalsector, of the regressive Common Agricultural
Policy; and the high cost of membership because
of Britain’s large budget contributions. The pro-
ponents’ claim that the advantages of the largermarket counterbalanced the cost underestimatedthe difﬁculty of making Britain competitive.The House of Commons majorities were neverlarge, but enough Labour pro-Europeans voted852WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
for the bill to cancel out the Conservative anti-marketeers and the majority of Labour memberswho voted against. Wilson held his party skilfully
together by promising to negotiate better terms
and then to submit the decision to the nation in
a referendum. The bill passed through theCommons on 13 July 1972 and Britain enteredthe EEC on 1 January 1973.In February 1974 it fell to a minority Labourgovernment to try to solve Britain’s problems and
to halt its economic decline. During the election
campaign, Labour had offered the country some-thing new: the so-called Social Contract betweenthe government and the trade unions. In return
for repealing Heath’s 1971 Industrial Relations
Act and so freeing the unions from the threat of
legal action, the unions promised voluntarywagerestraint. By the time Wilson called another elec-tion in October 1974 the worst industrial trou-
bles were over. The need to secure a Labour
victory acted as a restraint on the unions. The
miners’ strike had been settled and the countrywas back to a full working week. This time, inOctober, Labour gained a small working major-
ity. But by 1975 inﬂation had rocketed to 24 per
cent, and wage settlements were even higher. The
Social Contract was not working. Once more
Wilson had to resort to what amounted to avirtually compulsory pay policy.Wilson was also confronted with the divisiveEuropean issue. He had promised to renegotiate
the terms of entry to the EEC and to submit
them to a referendum as the best means to rec-oncile his divided party. He secured signiﬁcantconcessions in the negotiations and by a two-
thirds majority the electorate endorsed Britain’s
membership of the Community.In March 1976, Wilson unexpectedly resigned.After a total of eight years at 10 Downing Streettrying to manoeuvre between the left and right ofhis party and the trade unions, he apparently lost
his zest for politics. The economic crisis facing the
country was the most severe since 1947. His
hopes of regenerating British industry from theleft had been dashed. But he had provided asteadying influence and in his way he had as
unﬂappable an air as Macmillan. His administra-
tion bequeathed the National Enterprise Board,whose purpose was to stimulate growth in prof-itable new industry through government invest-ment, in return for a share of the proﬁts. The
government had also established the British
National Oil Corporation, taking a majority stake
in it to ensure that the state would proﬁt fromthe forthcoming bonanza of North Sea oil. Butthe extension of state intervention in industry was
bitterly attacked by the Conservative opposition.When James Callaghan took over the reins ofgovernment in April 1976 he found the Labour
majority precarious and the country in deep eco-nomic trouble. He secured his parliamentary posi-tion by entering into a pact with the Liberal
Party, allowing its leader David Steel to exercise
a major influence on government legislation
without entering the government itself. In thisway Callaghan was able to soldier on until 1979.Once more in the forefront of policy objectiveswas wage restraint, and fresh negotiations were
held with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in
1976. But in trying to maintain for too long ster-ling’s dollar exchange rate, Britain faced a seriousﬁnancial crisis in its balance of payments in 1976
and had to take a large loan from the Inter-
national Monetary Fund on condition that cuts
were made in public spending. The economy
began to fare better, inﬂation came down to justbelow 16 per cent in 1977 and to 8 per cent in1978, but unemployment stubbornly remained
around 1.5 million (about 8 per cent). Working
people had taken cuts in their living standards
under successive phases of pay restraint; in thewinter of 1978–9 pressure mounted to retrievelost ground in past wage settlements. When
Callaghan tried to bring down inﬂation further 
by announcing a wage-rise norm of 5 per cent,
which would have entailed further cuts in 
living standards, there was widespread revolt. IfCallaghan had gone to the country in the autumnof 1978 when the country appeared to be at last
out of crisis and on a steady course, he might have
won the election. The pervasive industrial unrest
of what became known as the ‘winter of discon-tent’ destroyed his chance of victory. Even thegravediggers struck. It seemed to working people
that they were being called upon to ‘solve’
Britain’s problems by depressing their living1HOW TO MAKE BRITAIN MORE PROSPEROUS853
standards time and time again; a family man couldnot live on his wages but was forced to collect awhole range of state social beneﬁts. The country
was in a mess. Many blamed the unions, others
the government.Having lost the support of the Liberals and ofthe Scottish nationalists after the failure to pushthrough devolution proposals for Scotland and
Wales, the government was forced to hold a
general election in May 1979 and was soundly
defeated.A new Conservative prime minister, MargaretThatcher, who had ousted Heath as party leader
in 1975, promised radical change. Like Heath she
did not come from a privileged background, but
was the proud daughter of a grocer; she was anexample of what could be achieved in post-warBritain by hard work, courage and dedication.
Describing herself as a ‘conviction politician’
whose policies and outlook were based on simple
values, she gained the support not only of themiddle classes but also of the working classes,especially among the skilled workers whose dif-
ferentials had suffered. With the austere Sir Keith
Joseph as her intellectual mentor, she promised
to move away from the past compromises of
Labour and Conservative, which had shifted thecentre of politics constantly to the left.The new policies were designed to allow marketforces to improve Britain’s competitiveness. State
industries would be made so efﬁcient that they

could hold their own without subsidies from thetaxpayers; once proﬁtable, some of them would be
sold back to private enterprise. The power of the
trade unions would be curbed, and they would be
made accountable both to their members and to
the public. According to Conservative thinking, a
better balance between employer and employeewould in this way be restored. Individual responsi-
bility and independence had to be encouraged;
hard work and enterprise would once again reap
their rewards. Direct taxation was reduced. A pop-

ular electoral move was to promise that council-house tenants would be able to buy their homes ata reduced price. Social beneﬁts would be restricted

to those who, through old age or sickness, were
not able to help themselves; they would not beextended to the able-bodied striker for instance.The government would not ﬁnance its expenditure
by printing money and so fuel inﬂation; sound

money would be its watchword.During Mrs Thatcher’s ﬁrst year in ofﬁce, theelection promise to honour pay awards led towidespread and substantial wage increases. This,together with the second oil-price rise of 1979–
80, knocked the economy sideways, as inﬂation
climbed to over 20 per cent. The government
nevertheless carried out part of its programme by
shifting the ﬁscal burden from direct to indirecttaxation. The lowering of income tax, and thepromise to reduce direct taxation further, proved
an election winner over the next decade. The
harsh deﬂation of 1980 and 1981, with a tightly
controlled money supply and high interest rates,decimated British manufacturing industry andsent unemployment soaring to over 3 million.
Full employment had ceased to be a priority of
government policy. By the autumn of 1981,
according to opinion polls Margaret Thatcher hadbecome the most unpopular prime minister sinceNeville Chamberlain in 1940. But she now dis-
played what was to become her greatest electoral
asset: she stuck to her policies. Within the gov-
ernment too she asserted her control, gradually
ridding herself of ‘wet’ ministers – former promi-nent Heath supporters – and replacing them withloyal followers of her own views. To the country
at large she declared that there was no other way
to restore the patient to health.The Labour opposition meanwhile was enfee-bled by internal divisions between its militant left,the soft left and the right. Its drift to the left led
in 1981 to the formation on the right of an
entirely new party, the Social Democratic Party,
which later concluded an electoral pact with the
Liberal Party, and the Alliance was born. For atime it appeared uncertain whether the LabourParty would survive as the main opposition. The
split in the opposition electoral vote rendered
Thatcher’s Conservative government unbeatable
for almost a decade, although the Conservativeshare of the vote never exceeded 44 per cent atthe general elections of 1979, 1983 or 1987.In April 1982 Britain was plunged into a mostimprobable conﬂict with Argentina. When the
854WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
Argentinian junta invaded the Falkland Islands,Margaret Thatcher did not hesitate. Regardless ofthe cost of defending a barren island with more
sheep on it than people, a principle was at stake:
Britain had to respond when its territory was
attacked. The Falkland islanders were British andhad rejected any form of Argentine sovereignty.If Britain allowed itself to be expelled by the
Argentinians its credibility as a signiﬁcant power
would be gravely damaged. Unlike the Suez
adventure, this was an enterprise that attracted
overwhelming public support.Just a year later, in June 1983, MargaretThatcher fought her second election. Helped by
the Falklands victory, and by the tough leadership
she had displayed, the Conservatives won a land-
slide victory with a parliamentary majority of 188over the Labour Party, whose share of the votehad sunk to 27.6 per cent. The Labour Party was
severely handicapped by two issues: its promise to
take Britain out of the European Community if
elected, and its adherence to unilateral nucleardisarmament. The Conservatives had a com-
manding majority of 144 over all other parties
combined. The new Alliance, at this, its ﬁrst test,
was closely behind Labour, with 25.4 per cent of
the vote, but the electoral system gave them only
twenty-three MPs. The question remained open:would a three-party contest now become thenorm, or would the Alliance or Labour emerge as
the winners in a resumption of two-party politics?Thatcher’s second administration, from 1983to 1987, saw no let-up in the attempt radicallyto reshape Britain’s economy. Public expenditureand the budget deficit would be reduced.
Privatisation of state-run industries would be
accelerated: British Telecom, British Airways and
British Gas provided a lucrative sales programme.
The administration was cautious on defence,increasing expenditure and supporting theAmerican cruise missile installation on bases in
Britain. Law and order and strengthening the
police were also high on the list, while further
restrictions were imposed on the unions in theTrade Union Reform Act. Even so, it was fromthe National Union of Miners, led by Arthur
Scargill, that the government faced its most
serious threat. The miners had brought downHeath; could they now bring down Thatcher,who was not only determined to curb the unionsin general but ready to take on the miners? The
new National Coal Board’s head was Ian
MacGregor, who had gained a reputation for
ruthless efﬁciency by slimming down and ration-alising the steel industry, in the process defeatingthe steel workers; his appointment to the NCB
by the government persuaded the coal miners to
strike for fear of pit closures and job losses. The
strike began in March 1984 and ended in defeat
for the miners a year later. In the course of it,there were many ugly confrontations betweenminers and police. But the government was fully
prepared, with large coal stocks, and in any case
the Nottingham and Derby miners refused to
strike, so dooming the National Union of Minersto defeat. Despite a great deal of sympathy forthe hardship suffered by the miners and their fam-
ilies, there was little nationwide support for the
leadership of the NUM or the trade union bosses.The government’s economic policies, however,continued to be heavily criticised. Unemploymentrose to over 3 million, and spending cuts put the
government at loggerheads with local authorities.
Admiration for Thatcher’s composure was again
aroused in October 1984, this time after the IRA’s
bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, wherethe Cabinet was staying during the ConservativeParty Conference. But her personal style of lead-
ership was also now meeting mounting criticism,
culminating in January 1986 in the walkout from
her Cabinet of the popular defence secretaryMichael Heseltine. The rights and wrongs of theirquarrel were less important than Heseltine’s accu-
sation that Margaret Thatcher no longer accepted
the normal practices of Cabinet government, that
her behaviour represented a breakdown of the
constitutional process. These were the ﬁrst warn-ing signals that approval for strong leadershipcould turn into general resentment of ‘bossiness’
and ‘nannying’. It was also noted that Thatcher
had the irritating habit of referring to herself 
with a royal ‘we’.With an election approaching, public spendingrestrictions were eased, a policy made more feasi-
ble by the rise in oil-tax revenues and by indus-
trial growth since the low of 1981. Inﬂation had1HOW TO MAKE BRITAIN MORE PROSPEROUS855
fallen from 11 per cent in 1981 to an average of4.4 per cent in 1985–7, and wages for those in work rose much faster than inﬂation, while
mortgage-holders benefited from low interest
rates. Council-house sales proved very popular
too. But unemployment, at over 3 million, re-mained stubbornly high, though governmenttraining measures had slightly reduced the total.
Manufacturing industry had shrunk, and what
remained was leaner and more productive; but 
the 2 million jobs lost added greatly to the num-
bers of the long-term unemployed.In foreign affairs Thatcher was equally deter-mined to make her views clearly known. She
strongly supported NATO and the American
alliance and established an especially close rapport
with President Reagan, though that did notinhibit her from making strong protests when shethought he was wrong, as when the US invaded
Grenada in 1983. But she permitted the use of
US bases in Britain for the American attack on
Libya in April 1986, because she regarded it asjustiﬁed by Gaddaﬁ’s support for terrorism. Shecontinued to show that she deserved the sobri-
quet ‘Iron Lady’, maintaining her robust opposi-
tion to all communist tyrannies. Yet she was the
first world leader to recognise that Mikhail
Gorbachev was a new phenomenon in Sovietleadership, a man with whom ‘one could do busi-ness’. At the end of March 1987, she visited
Moscow and had long talks with the Soviet 
president which helped to pave the way for the
ending of the Cold War.The future of the Crown colony of HongKong, much of whose territory would return to
China in 1997, was another problem her admin-
istration tackled. To her it was a practical ques-
tion of making the best deal possible. At the time
of the negotiations in December 1984, China wasin a reforming phase, and Britain appeared tohave secured at least some safeguards, preserving
for Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy.Less happy were Thatcher’s relations with therest of the Commonwealth. She opposed any butinnocuous sanctions against the apartheid policiesof South Africa, arguing that they would harm the
black Africans more than the whites. This placed
her in a minority of one. In Western Europe, too,she frequently found herself isolated. She was nofriend of the Brussels bureaucracy and wasinclined to resist the claims of the Commission to
regulate in detail. As she saw it, she was not about
to free Britons from Whitehall only to subordi-
nate them to Brussels. She was a free-trader atheart, believing in the unhindered ﬂow of worldtrade as the best guarantee of prosperity. Oppos-
ed to the interventionism of Brussels and in 
particular to the featherbedding of French and
German farmers, she made unremitting efforts to
reduce the cost of the Common AgriculturalPolicy, which kept food prices artiﬁcially high forthe people in the Community, partly by accumu-
lating butter mountains and wine lakes. But her
tone was often strident and abrasive. It secured
results over such issues as the reduction ofBritain’s excessive contribution to the commonCommunity budget but was counter-productive
in other ways. Mrs Thatcher was not regarded by
her fellow EC leaders as a ‘good European’, yet
she believed that the policies she pursued wereright not only for Britain but for the Communityas a whole.When Margaret Thatcher decided to call herthird general election in 1987, the majority in
work were better off than ever before. The econ-
omy appeared to be progressing steadily and theopposition was split between the Alliance and theLabour Party. Since October 1983, the Labour
Party had had a youthful new leader in Neil
Kinnock, the son of a Welsh miner. Kinnock, who
belonged to the moderate left, had succeeded inuniting the party once again but was handicappedby an electoral pledge to remove all nuclear
weapons from Britain. On the nuclear defence
issue, the Alliance was also in complete disarray.
All three parties made use during the election
campaign of slick advertising-agency promotion.Television and media consultants were pressedinto the campaign as never before. For Labour,
the red rose replaced the red flag. For the
Conservatives, Thatcher was bathed in blue with
golden hairdos of singular height. The Alliancesported a ‘battle bus’ vividly decorated with balloons. On polling day in June 1987, the
Conservatives achieved almost the same level of
support (42.3 per cent of the vote) as in 1983. For856WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
Labour and the Alliance the result was decisive:Labour had clearly seen off the Alliance’s attemptto replace it (Labour gained 30.8 per cent of the
vote and the Alliance dropped to 22.6 per cent).
Thatcher’s programme to change Britain would
continue for a further term. Indeed, there seemednot the remotest possibility that she was even con-templating retirement. She declared that she was
ready to go on to a fourth election victory and
beyond.Thatcher was determined to show that thoughthis was her third administration there would beno loss of vigour, no retreat from the Thatcherrevolution. The great state-run services – social
security, the National Health Service and educa-
tion – would be shaken up by the introduction of
competition, to produce efﬁciency and respon-siveness to the customer, and better value for thetaxpayer. This was radical conservatism. Just as a
radical Labour administration after 1945 had
been ready to take on the establishment, so Mrs
Thatcher relished doing the same: the BritishMedical Association, the National Union ofTeachers, university vice-chancellors, lawyers and
judges. Reforms were indeed highly desirable.
Providing ever more funds was not the answer 
to dirty hospitals and cross-infection, to poor
standards in many state schools, to a higher-education sector unwilling to increase studentnumbers without additional cash. But the public
mood was changing; there was a feeling that it
was time to consolidate. Thatcher’s philosophy
was hurting not only the idle, but also the poor.Beneﬁts from reform were not seen to be comingthrough. Privatisation of a whole host of state
enterprises from British Airways to the water
authorities had lost its excitement and seemed
only to be making proﬁts for investors.The country was split between the rich southand the deprived manufacturing towns of thenorth. Entering the third industrial revolution,
Britain was experiencing much painful readjust-
ment; unemployment remained above the 2
million mark. Britain’s industrial base had shrunkbut was in a much more competitive position:that was the positive side. The Thatcher govern-
ment’s great achievement was the conquest of
inﬂation – or was it?The economy began to go wrong in 1988 aftersix years of unprecedented growth. After thestock-market fall (it was thought at the time 
to be a crash), the chancellor of the exchequer 
Nigel Lawson had eased money control too much;
then in trying to keep sterling from rising toohigh and hurting exports, he over-compensatedand pushed interest rates too low. Difficulties
multiplied: the trade balance slipped, a tax-cutting
budget in April 1988 proved not to be the right
remedy. Income tax cuts had been the most
popular strategy of the Thatcher governments, inlarge measure paid for by raising indirect taxes,reducing central government contributions to
local authority spending and increasing National
Insurance payments. The total tax burden had not
in fact been reduced; and the wealthy beneﬁtedfar more than the poor. Inﬂation began to riseagain and interest rates also climbed to heights
which hurt all homeowners with mortgages. An
excessive house-price boom shuddered to a halt.Pressured by Lawson and Howe, the primeminister agreed that Britain should soon join theEuropean Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)
when a number of conditions had been met. But
in October 1989 Lawson resigned, complaining
that Mrs Thatcher was undermining his steward-
ship of the economy by turning to an outsideadviser. By then the Thatcher economic miraclewas looking tarnished. But what spelt political
doom for her was the ill-advised introduction of a
new method of ﬁnancing local government spend-
ing, the community charge, or ‘poll tax’ as itbecame universally known. If the total revenue the local authorities had to raise because of the
declining central government contribution had
not been generally so high, the measure might
have attracted less odium. But it was seen as
patently unfair that the lord in his manor was nowpaying less than a working-class family crowdedinto a council house.During 1990 unease grew among the Con-
servative faithful. The party was deeply divided
between Thatcher loyalists in an increasinglysmaller majority and the sceptics who thoughtthat, under Margaret Thatcher, the Conservatives
would lose the next election, which could not be
held later than 1992. When, in November 1990,1HOW TO MAKE BRITAIN MORE PROSPEROUS857
Sir Geoffrey Howe became the third seniorConservative minister to resign from the Cabinet,in his case incensed by Thatcher’s handling of rela-

tions with the European Community, she knew
she had a real ﬁght on her hands if she was to
remain leader of the party. Although she gained amajority and almost made it on the ﬁrst ballot, her
majority under the party’s rules was not quite large
enough to assure her of outright victory. Her
Cabinet colleagues now warned her that she would
lose the second round to Michael Heseltine. On
22 November 1990 she resigned and threw hersupport behind John Major, the chancellor of theexchequer, in a determined bid to stop Heseltine.
Major was elected and healed party divisions by
immediately asking Heseltine to join the Cabinet.The trend in Britain in the early 1990s, as inthe US, was to present a more caring socialimage. The Conservative Party had dropped the
longest-serving prime minister in the twentieth
century, winner of three elections. Despite
obvious ﬂaws as a politician, Margaret Thatchersucceeded in changing the course of Britishpolitics. When in 1979 she entered Downing
Street it was by no means widely accepted that
state socialism was a dismal failure – she altered
the political agenda. An impoverished country,
after all, cannot care for those in need. The rightbalance has to be struck between wealth-creationand the provision of health and social services for
all those who have a right to expect it.Fundamentally Thatcherism was about therejection of socialism in all its manifestations,from the public ownership of industry to curingthe problems of poverty through welfare.
Margaret Thatcher destroyed trade union power
and the cartel restrictions of labour, and poured
scorn on the ideal that the care of the individual
from ‘cradle to grave’ was the responsibility ofsociety. She set out to stop the centre of politicsswinging every few years a bit more to the left.
In socialism’s place she held out a different vision,
of the able-bodied individuals being masters of
their own fate, making their own provisioninstead of relying on a welfare state. Welfare wasto be restricted to those who could not help
themselves. The British people were to recapture
the spirit of enterprise, the urge to advance theirown fortunes. Inequalities of wealth were to bewelcomed, as a necessary consequence of motiva-tion. Conservative governments would therefore
lower direct taxation and seek to reduce govern-
ment expenditure as a proportion of the country’s
wealth. They proclaimed that people should beable to spend their money themselves and nothave the government spend it for them. The free-
market economy was the way forward for the
country, not state planning and intervention.In practice many of Mrs Thatcher’s policieswere modiﬁed during the course of her own threeadministrations. The British people collectivelywere opposed to any signiﬁcant tampering with
free state education, social security and universal
health provision. Spending for these sectors from
1978 to 1990 increased substantially to cope withhigh unemployment and an ageing populationwith growing expectations of care. The British on
the whole are not given to ideological extremes.
In the face of the electorate’s suspicions of their
aims, Conservative governments, including JohnMajor’s since 1990, have attempted throughreorganisation and by creating an element of
competition, to achieve better value or money in
the state sector. Health treatment remains uni-
versally free for every patient, while the cost of
medicines and ancillary services have been raisedfor wage-earners. Beveridge’s vision of a welfarestate is intact. British society has turned against
Marxist economic organisation, but socialist
ideals of equal opportunity, of a classless society,
of progressive taxation, of help for the disadvan-taged and the poor continue to permeate all polit-ical parties.The enterprise culture had some successes for atime, especially in the establishment of a record
number of small businesses. House ownership
rose from just over half to 66 per cent of the pop-ulation, the highest in Western Europe. The deeprecession which began in 1990 dented these
achievements, but the trend of increased home
ownership over the decade continued. The same is
true of small businesses, although a record num-ber failed during the recession of the early 1990s.Margaret Thatcher also succeeded in increas-ing inequality. The higher-rate tax of 40 per cent
beneﬁted most the very rich, who now paid the858WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
same marginal rate as the middle class. Livingstandards rose for all sections of the community,but unequally – the wealthiest 20 per cent gained
by nearly a third, while the bottom 20 per cent
secured only 1 per cent more income. The most
negative impact of the Thatcher years was theabsolute growth of long-term unemploymentwith real poverty more than trebling from 6 per
cent to 19 per cent between 1979 and 1987. And
as unemployment and poverty rose, so did crime.
With unemployment over 2 million in 1990 and
rising, and easy money having fuelled inﬂation,Thatcher left an unenviable legacy to her succes-sor, John Major. As chancellor of the exchequer,
he had tried to remedy the inﬂationary policies of
1987 and 1988, when Nigel Lawson had held
that post.Margaret Thatcher’s success has to be mea-sured in terms of economic growth. After the
recession of 1980–2 there was comparatively
rapid growth until the recession that started in
1990, but manufacturing industry overall sawlittle expansion, in contrast to the experience ofother developed nations. It was the service sector
that took up some of the slack, helping to account
for an increase in Gross Domestic Product of 27
per cent during the years from 1979 to 1990. In
1991 to 1992 output declined, and so loweredthe average annual gain. Privatisation was one ofthe most striking features of the Thatcher years;
no less remarkable were the increases in produc-
tivity and competitiveness of many industries,
which thus came to match the best of Britain’sWestern neighbours. But the jury is out on pri-vatised monopolies or near-monopolies such as
telephones, gas and water and how far their new
status beneﬁts the consumer.Detailed economic and social statistics revealthe uneven successes of the Thatcher years. Tradeunion power had been reined back, but mobilityof labour was still hindered by lack of technical
training and by the differentials in housing costs
between regions of high and low unemployment.
London became unaffordable for the workingman from Liverpool, and the quantity of rentedaccommodation and council houses drastically
diminished. Thatcher succeeded in changing 
the debate within British politics. It was theConservatives who now forced Labour to moveaway from certain socialist tenets, such as nation-alisation. But John Major, in espousing the class-
less society stole some of the socialist clothing.Under Neil Kinnock’s leadership the LabourParty entered the April 1992 election with aﬁrmly pro-European Community policy. With theabandonment of both unilateral nuclear disarma-
ment and nationalisation, the main socialist plank
was the proposal to redistribute taxes so that they
fell more heavily on the upper-income groups.
This proved to be one reason why Labour lost theelection, the voters fearing that in the end the richwould not be the only losers. They were, above
all, concerned with ﬁnancial prudence, to safe-
guard their employment and reduce the cost of
their mortgages. Redistribution to the poor wasnot their ﬁrst priority. There is some parallel herewith the US.The post-Thatcher years of British politics weredifferent in style. John Major projected an imageof someone who understood the needs of ordi-nary men and women. Much was made of the
fact that he had climbed the social ladder the hard
way, and that in his younger years he had expe-
rienced unemployment. He immediately began by
rectifying the poll-tax disaster, which he and NigelLawson (then chancellor of the exchequer) hadopposed when its introduction was debated in the
Cabinet in 1987 and 1988. It was replaced in
1993 with a modified property tax. Poll-tax
burdens meanwhile were softened by additionalgovernment grants to local authorities paid for by a rise in VAT (value added tax). The Major
government, with Norman Lamont continuing as
chancellor of the exchequer, braved the unpopu-
larity after 1990 of having to squeeze inﬂation
once more out of the system by raising interestrates and keeping them high. Britain had enteredthe European Community Exchange Rate 
Mechanism (ERM) at a relatively high exchange
rate in October 1990, in the hope that this also
would bear down on inﬂation. The ﬁerce squeezeled to rising unemployment again and to anunprecedented drop in house prices after the
boom of the late 1980s. This was intended to
allow an early end to the recession so that the1HOW TO MAKE BRITAIN MORE PROSPEROUS859
next election in the early 1990s could be foughtwith lower interest rates, sound money, a strongeconomy and a return of conﬁdence.Norman Lamont began to talk about greenshoots of recovery in the summer of 1991, but by
the spring of 1992 no recovery had appeared.Thus the Conservatives were left ﬁghting the elec-tion in April 1992 in the midst of a recession. The
pundits said that the Conservatives would do well
just to remain the largest party, with the Liberal
Democrats holding the balance and Labour not
far behind the Conservatives. It was even possi-ble that Labour would win outright. When all wasgloom around him John Major fought an upbeat
election campaign, projecting once again a rea-
sonable and likeable personality, the sort of man
you can trust. Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader,who had done so much to reunite his party, toexpel the militant extremists and to convey a
moderate, caring outlook, also campaigned with
warmth and verve. But to overturn the huge
Conservative majority was a mountain no partyhad successfully climbed before. When the resultsof the 9 April election were in, Labour had made
large gains but not enough to become the party
of government. Surprisingly, the total Conserva-
tive vote had not fallen from the number cast for
Margaret Thatcher in 1987.The Liberal Democrats’ hopes of forcingthrough a system of proportional representation
were dashed. Neil Kinnock’s leadership was over.
The new Conservative government expected a
long period of political stability.John Major’s Cabinet made it a priority to curethe economy once and for all by reducing inﬂa-
tion to the same low levels as prevailed in France
and Germany. The discipline of the ERM with its
ﬁxed exchange rates and resulting low pay awards
was among the weapons. At the Maastrichtsummit in December 1991 Major scored a per-sonal triumph in securing for Britain the specialterms it wanted. At home after a short period of
pain Britain was expected to move out of its
longest recession since the war. Inﬂation came
down sharply in 1992, but unemployment con-tinued to rise. The green shoots of recovery hadlong ago withered and the landscape remained as
desolate as before.The Labour Party in July 1992 under the lead-ership of the newly elected John Smith gained
greater credence by calling for a change of policy.Everyone blamed the Germans, who were ﬁnanc-ing East German recovery by spending money the
government did not have instead of substantially
raising taxes. The result was high interest rates in
Germany and misery all around. But Britain’s illsran deeper. Major with his winning personalityand nice smile was elected as a less formidable and
more ﬂexible replacement for the Iron Lady.But in economic policy Major attempted to actas the Iron Man. Britain, he declared, would playa role at the ‘heart’ of Europe. At the centre ofthe government’s policy for defeating inﬂation

and making Britain fully competitive was the 
decision to link the pound with the least inﬂa-
tionary currency in Europe, the German mark,
through the ERM at a ﬁxed rate of exchange. InSeptember 1992 John Major faced a humiliatingretreat. The exchange rate could be held no
longer and Britain left the ERM. In practice this
led to the devaluation of the pound. It was a
political disaster of a magnitude few governmentssince the war had suffered. The credibility of theprime minister, of the chancellor of the exchequer
and indeed of the whole government was
damaged. The issue of closer ties with Europe, 
of moving towards political and ﬁnancial union 
by the end of the century, had already split theConservative and Labour Parties. But a majorityin both had favoured the moves towards this 
goal embodied in the Maastricht Treaty. Now 
the anti-Maastricht groups in both parties took
heart from the debacle. It had become clear, andthe narrow victory for ratiﬁcation in France con-ﬁrmed it, that there were many people through-
out Europe who felt deep misgivings about
European union and the loss of national sover-860WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968

eignty. Attitudes were hardening against theConservative government and its whole Europeanstrategy.At home, October 1992 proved another dis-astrous month for the prime minister and his
Cabinet. The announcement that thirty-one pitswere to be closed and thousands of miners leftwithout work, albeit with some compensation,
caused widespread anger well beyond the mining
communities. Facing defeat in the House of
Commons the government had to draw back.
The loss of contact with public feeling, the con-tinuing recession and unemployment risingtowards 3 million, more than one in ten of the
workforce, brought the public approval rating of
the government to a new low. Most damagingly,
John Major’s leadership and good judgementwere being widely questioned. Rarely had a gov-ernment’s fortunes been so quickly reversed after
an election victory.There were close parallels between Reagan-omics and the conduct of the economic policiesfollowed by the conservatives. These parallelsincluded a rising budget deﬁcit as the costs of
unemployment increased while tax revenue fell
during the years of recession, the longest since the
war. House prices dropped steeply, the overhang
of the personal credit binge of the 1980s whichhad showered plastic cards on virtually everyone,and the continuing threat of unemployment
undermined the conﬁdence of the man in the
street to spend money on anything other than
necessities. In 1993 a shift in economic policy hadbecome unavoidable. The number one problemwas now unemployment which once again was
three million. Special statistical measures and gov-
ernment training schemes disguised the true total
which was much higher. This time it affected not
just the Midland and northern industrial regionsbut also the conservative heartlands of London,eastern and southern England. The pendulum of
economic and social policies was swinging back
from ‘less government’ to the need for more inter-
vention and assistance. Thatcherite conservatismproved to be no more the last word in Britishpolitics than Reaganomics was in the US.Governments in power during long periods ofrecession are unpopular everywhere, blamed forhigh unemployment and disappointing expecta-tions of better standards of living. This was truefor John Major’s Conservative administration too,
but there were added difﬁculties. The party was
rent by differences over Europe – whether to
accept or reject closer union. The government’ssmall majority after the 1992 elections made themanagement of policy exceptionally difﬁcult in
the face of the determined anti-European minor-
ity of the party. The rift extended to the Cabinet
itself; Major was left with no alternative but to try
to continue to work with those who opposedhim. Furthermore, the recession led to balloon-ing public expenditure. The 1994 budget which,
for the ﬁrst time, raised taxes on such essentials
as fuel for heating, was deeply unpopular. The
recession was slow to end and the feel-good factorremained conspicuously absent; job insecurity andyears of falling house prices undermined public
conﬁdence. Although John Major faced down a
leadership challenge in 1995 his majority in the
House of Commons narrowed to one the fol-lowing year. His government came close tohaving to depend for its survival on the Ulster
Unionist MPs, which reduced his ﬂexibility in
handling the problems of Northern Ireland.The Major administration’s important achieve-ment was to bring about the virtual cessation ofviolence in Northern Ireland in 1995. Secret con-tacts and concessions on the one hand, and the
ﬁrmness of Britain’s handling of terrorism on the
other, brought rewards. Major succeeded in estab-
lishing close partnerships with successive primeministers of the Republic of Ireland. But in 1996when the IRA was unable to win by democratic
process, it returned to bombing the mainland.The problem that continued to split the Con-servative Party was Britain’s future role in Europe.In straddling the views of the pro- and anti-Europeans, the government’s policy aims remain-
ed ambiguous and Britain’s inﬂuence in the coun-
cils of the European Union weak. The standing 
of the government fell precipitously. Mad-cowdisease, and the fear that it could infect humans,added to John Major’s woes and heightened 
tension with Europe. Labour fortunes meantime
revived. Tony Blair, newly chosen leader of the1HOW TO MAKE BRITAIN MORE PROSPEROUS861
Labour Party after John Smith’s sudden death,moved the party towards the centre, rejecting out-worn socialist dogma. The modernisation of the
party, begun a decade earlier by Neil Kinnock, was
bearing fruit. Blair’s leadership revitalised Labour,
his promises not to be spendthrift making it elec-table for the ﬁrst time in years. The ‘enterprise’economy was to be developed into the ‘stake-
holder’ economy, though the general public did
not know quite what that meant. Eighteen years
of Conservative rule had significantly changed 
the economic scene, curbed trade union powers,privatised subsidised state industries and madeBritain safe for a two- (or more) party system by
forcing Labour to drop old-style socialism and to
modernise. Britain had been plunged into reces-
sion earlier than the countries of continentalEurope, but was also the ﬁrst to emerge afterpainful readjustments and high unemployment.
Eighteen years of Conservative government came
to an end on 1 May 1997, when Labour won a
landslide victory, with 419 members of parliamentelected to the House of Commons of 659 seats.John Major’s Conservatives suffered their worst
ever defeat, winning only 165 seats, and although
the Liberal Democrats, the third party, strength-
ened their position, Tony Blair, the new 44-year-
old prime minister, with a majority of 179, wasnot dependent on them. After repeated Labourelectoral defeats, Blair, who had become leader of
the Labour Party in 1994, set about shedding the
last elements of the traditional socialist Labour
ideology: nationalisation and renationalisationwere dead; the redistribution of wealth by taxingthe rich and the middle-income groups who had
gained most under the Conservatives was rejected;
the Thatcherite market economy was accepted;
the earlier rights of the trade unions would not be
restored. This was ‘New Labour’. It was difﬁcultto deﬁne what was ‘Labour’ about it: the old ‘left’and ‘right’ labels no longer ﬁtted a party whose
key claim was to ‘modernise’. ‘New Labour’ came
to look like a pragmatic radical conservative alter-
native, a one-nation party bent on equality ofopportunity, determined like Thatcher to pro-
mote the work ethic and change welfare. Beneﬁts
would no longer be provided indiscriminately; a
readiness to work would be rewarded; what wassaved on welfare would be spent on subsidies toemployers who took on the young unemployed.Blair’s agenda for ‘New Labour’ had much in
common with Clinton’s ‘New Democrats’ and,
given their close links, this was no coincidence.With such a small majority John Major haddone well to keep going at all until 1997; hisparty was split on the issue of monetary union and
closer European integration and further damaged
by some high-proﬁle cases of sleaze. However,
the radical Conservatives approach to the
economy, promoting privatisation and flexiblelabour, had led to a dramatic turnaround:Britain’s comparatively low direct and indirect
wage costs attracted inward investment from
Germany, the US, Japan and Korea; unemploy-
ment had fallen from a peak of over 3 million towell under a million, inﬂation was low and thenew expansion was under control with a strong
pound. Britain, once the ‘sick man of Europe’,
was now the model for recovery.Major’s one success was in Northern Irelandwhere he sought peace through negotiation. Hisinitiative appeared to have failed when the IRA
resumed their bombing campaign in London and
Manchester. But the Conservatives started a
process which, after the elections, a Labour gov-
ernment was able to revive.That was the state of Britain inherited by ‘NewLabour’. With tight reins on government spend-
ing there were also large problem areas: educa-
tion had been neglected under the Conservativesuntil very recently. Schools were underfunded,teachers poorly paid and undervalued; the
National Health Service demanded ever increas-
ing resources and struggled to meet basic needs
– waiting lists for operations extended to a year
or more as Britain spent less on health than com-parable developed nations. New Labour hadpromised ﬁscal prudence – a promise it fulﬁlled.
In 1999 Blair’s support remained high; old-style
socialism had been ditched. Blair urged moderni-
sation while building on previous Conservativechanges. On 22 May 1998 a momentous changeoccurred when the Northern Ireland peace deal,
brokered in April, ‘the Good Friday Agreement’,
was approved by 71 per cent of the Northern862WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
Irish voters and 90 per cent of voters in theRepublic. It marks not the end of all violence, butthe beginning of the end.While the devolution of government withGerry Adams’ Sinn Féin ministers sharing power
with Ulster Unionists had a rocky beginning andthe IRA did not complete its decommissioning,the military paramilitias on both sides did not wish
to renew ‘the war’ opposed by the overwhelming
number of people Catholic and Protestant in
Northern Ireland. Even the breakaway ‘Real IRA’
suspended bombing after the horriﬁc explosionthey caused in Omagh on 15 August 1998 whichkilled twenty-nine and injured many more. An
uneasy peace descended on the province.Blair scored highly for his ﬁrm moral leader-ship in urging intervention in the Kosovo human-itarian crisis in 1997 and 1998 and seeing thatconﬂict to a successful conclusion. At home he
was equally sure-footed when responding to the
unprecedented outpouring of public grief at the
funeral of Princess Diana in September 1997.Over Europe the country was still divided butBlair hoped to lead his reluctant countrymen to
the heart of the European Union. A formula was
found that would leave the economic decision to
join the Monetary Union when conditions were
right to Gordon Brown, the chancellor of theexchequer; the political decision had already beenmade in favour. Blair was attempting to ride two
horses at once.Though the promise of a better NationalHealth Service and improved public services didnot materialise, the economy remained in soundshape. The Bank of England, not politicians, was
now setting interest rates to meet a low inﬂation
target; unemployment was low and the country
was doing much better than Britain’s neighbours.
Blair’s strong leadership in the crisis in Kosovo in1999 won him much support (Chapter 78). Blairasked for a second mandate to complete New
Labour’s promises. The general election was
called in June 2001. New Labour won by a land-
slide almost as great as four years earlier. In hissecond administration the country expected NewLabour to show the results of its reforming poli-cies. Trust in the prime minister was at its peak.At home, the public services, especially theNational Health Service, failed to improve fast
enough; it attracted increasing criticism duringthe second administration. Chancellor Brownuntil 2002 kept a prudent ﬁnancial policy going
and opposed the entry of Britain into the Euro-
pean Monetary Union as the ‘ﬁve tests’ had not
been passed. In 2003 Brown massively increased
public spending and accepted that a large deﬁcitwould result. Blair, more keen than Brown toplace Britain fully into the European Union, was
unable to make much progress against a sceptical
British public.A deﬁning moment for the prime minister wasthe decision to back the US in the war againstIraq in March 2003 (Chapter 79). There was
strong parliamentary and public opposition
though the majority approved driving Saddam
Hussein from power. Blair’s reputation for trust-worthiness, however, received a check wheninvestigations caused by the suicide of a civil
service scientist Dr Kelly, in the summer of 2003
broadened into questioning whether the case put
by Blair before parliament for going to war had
been sound. That may be a just criticism as itrelated to the 45-minute claim, that this is allSaddam needed to ready weapons of mass
destruction, but not that Blair had deliberately
misled parliament and the British people. Trust in
him was again brought into question when itbecame clear in 2004 that there were no weaponsof mass destruction in Iraq. But the Conservative
opposition had to make up much ground to place
Labour into serious doubt of winning a third
term on 5 May, 2005. ‘New Labour’ espoused
‘one nation’ politics and moved to the middleground, Michael Howard and his colleagues hadto ﬁnd a fresh Conservative electoral appeal. The
Liberal Democrats offered an alternative as the
electorate was not enthusiastic about either major
party in the election year.1HOW TO MAKE BRITAIN MORE PROSPEROUS863
After the high drama of the de Gaulle years,President Georges Pompidou restored calm toFrance. Pompidou had been closely associatedwith de Gaulle and had served as his prime min-
ister until the general dismissed him in July 1968.
After de Gaulle’s resignation in 1969, Pompidou
returned to power as his successor. A cautiousconservative, Pompidou was nevertheless ready toembark on reforms designed to ease social and
regional tensions. His succession to the presidency
promised continuity without de Gaulle’s auto-
cratic style of government. He was approachable,
a symbol of the good life that France providedfor its more fortunate citizens. With a backgroundin ﬁnance, Pompidou had served as a director of
the merchant bank Rothschild Frères. The healing
of France’s divisions, the president believed,
would best be served by putting France once moreon the road to prosperity.An austerity programme that was set in motionin 1969, the devaluation of the franc and a loan
from the International Monetary Fund, realistic
steps that de Gaulle would have rejected as a sluron French nationalism, provided the springboardfor future expansion. But they also provoked a
rash of strikes in 1969. In France the archaic 
and the modern had continued to exist side by
side: the small peasant farmer and the large land-
holder, the department store and multitudes ofsmall shopkeepers, technologically advancedindustries and artisans. Exports lagged behind
those of other countries – much of French indus-
try was not competitive.The Sixth Plan set out to modernise Francemore rapidly by opening it to international com-petition. It gave priority to industrial develop-ment, but gave less scope to central control than
previous plans. Pompidou’s liberal, free-market
approach achieved good results. Until the oil
shock of 1973–4, Pompidou helped to acceler-ate industrialisation, now stimulated by worlddemand for French goods. The Gross Domestic
Product between 1969 and 1973 grew by an
annual average of 5.6 per cent, while inﬂation was
contained and unemployment kept low.As industry became competitive once more inworld markets, Pompidou cleverly cushionedFrench farmers, who could not be competitive. In
return for agreeing to abandon de Gaulle’s veto
on Britain’s entry to the EEC, he secured a good
deal for France’s farmers from its CommonMarket partners.Apart from a softer style and a great improve-
ment in Anglo-French relations, France’s funda-

mentally nationalist and independent outlook did
not change much in foreign affairs. The pursuit ofa European option and of detente with the SovietUnion and the Eastern bloc was only temporarily
successful, and not of any lasting consequence.
Nor did the more friendly Gaullist policies towards
the Arab states save France from the huge oil-price
rises which the Arab oil-exporting countriesimposed on the rest of the world after the outbreakof the Arab–Israeli War in October 1973.Pompidou’s first prime minister, JacquesChaban-Delmas, wanted a more radical pro-
Chapter 74THE REVIVAL OF FRANCE
gramme, a Kennedy-style ‘new society’, but wasable to win the president’s consent only to limitedreforms. Decentralisation and cooperation bet-

ween the modern and the traditional sectors of
French industry and commerce were furthered in
1969 by creating local commissions and electedchambers of commerce and industry. Indirectlyelected regional bodies, created in 1972, to over-

see regional development were another half-
hearted attempt to broaden participation at the
local level. None of these reforms went far enough
and Pompidou’s last year in ofﬁce before he died of
cancer in April 1974 saw a decline in the economyand, in July 1972, the replacement of Chaban-
Delmas by the more conservative Pierre Messmer.French politics were not a straightforward two-or three-party contest, as in Britain and theFederal Republic of Germany. The success of adominant coalition depended on manoeuvring by
the main parties, not least among groups further
to their right or left. Two groups made up the
right–centre coalition. First were the Gaullists,known after 1968 as the Union Democrats pourla République (UDR). Many of the UDR’s pro-
minent members were powerful former Gaullist
resistance leaders, who had accepted de Gaulle’s
leadership and his emphasis on French independ-
ence and nationalism. On other economic andsocial issues, however, they differed widely, so assoon as the recognised leader, de Gaulle, and his
accepted heir, Pompidou, had departed, their
cohesion became fragile. They had also inherited
the Gaullist tradition of lax discipline, whichmade their continued cohesion after 1974 evenmore problematical when the more powerful
politicians contested the leadership. Though in
decline after 1968, and more so after 1973, they
still formed the majority in the coalition of the
right.The other party of the right–centre coalitionhad been founded by Pompidou’s minister of
ﬁnance, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. More liberal
than the UDR, closer to the social-market views
of the West German CDU, the IndependentRepublican Party (RP) was also less nationalistic,more open to European cooperation and more in
favour of the American alliance. The excitement
aroused by French politics in the 1970s and1980s was therefore as much due to the rivalrieswithin the right–centre coalition as to its contestwith the socialists.On the left, the traditional division betweenthe political parties and the trade unions dated
back all the way to the Tours Congress of 1920,at which they had split. The post-war FrenchCommunist Party (PC) modelled itself closely 
on its bigger Soviet brother and was loyal to
Moscow; but it had in its way become a conser-
vative force too, and was careful to have nothing
to do with the students’ revolutionary tactics in1968. It took a more democratic stance in the1970s and for a time, from 1972 to 1977, once
more accepted the popular-front electoral alliance
with the Socialist Party, after being wooed by
François Mitterrand, the wily Socialist Partyleader. But the PC’s rapid decline after 1978 (inthe election of 1986 it gained only thirty-ﬁve
seats, no more than the extreme-right National
Front) has effected a radical change in French
politics.The Socialist Party, before 1971 a creature ofthe centre as much as of the left, had also pre-
cipitously lost support. When François Mitterrand
became its leader, he undertook to revive it with
a more democratic socialist-oriented programme
of nationalisation, worker control and decentrali-sation. He also espoused a reduction of presiden-tial government, in line with his bitter attacks on
de Gaulle’s autocratic style. Most important in
laying the foundation for his eventual triumph 
in ending the twenty-three-year run of right–centre coalitions was his success in securing theagreement of the communists to a common pro-
gramme of government. To this coalition were
added other groups, including the new Radical
Movement of the Left (MRG). In the presiden-
tial elections of 1974 Mitterrand came close todefeating the man who had ﬁnally emerged as theright–centre coalition’s presidential candidate,
Giscard d’Estaing.Though Giscard had beaten off a Gaullist chal-lenge in the ﬁrst ballot of the elections for thepresidency, before going on to beat Mitterrandby a whisker, the Gaullists in the National
Assembly were not only the largest party but they
had more than three times as many seats as1THE REVIVAL OF FRANCE865
Giscard’s RP party. Ever since he had brokenaway from de Gaulle in 1962, Giscard’s relationswith the Gaullists had been characterised by
opposition as much as by cooperation. Yet coop-
eration between the Gaullists and the RP was
essential if they were to beat off the combinedforces of the left. So Giscard set out to strengthenhis government by drawing his ministers from a
broad coalition of the right and centre with
Jacques Chirac, a Gaullist UDR leader, as prime
minister. The intensely ambitious Chirac had, like
Giscard, served Pompidou as a minister, but hefelt no sympathy for much of Giscard’s liberalreforming zeal, nor for his European outlook.
Chirac’s power base was the UDR, whose inﬂu-
ence Giscard was attempting to erode by creating
a broad coalition of the right and centre. Giscard,who to begin with had cordially refrained frompresidential interference in government affairs,
was soon clashing with Chirac over control of
policies. But their cooperation in 1974 and 1975
saw the passage of important reforms.Giscard projected himself as a popular people’spresident, modelling his ﬁreside television chats
on those of Franklin Roosevelt, in an attempt to
overcome his elitist disdain for the people. But his
desire for a more liberal, modern and just society
was both strong and sincere. He was sympatheticto the assertion of women’s rights and a numberof laws were passed in 1974 and 1975 to help
achieve equality of the sexes; greater beneﬁts were
allowed to single parents; abortion was legalised;
and divorce was made easier if it was mutuallydesired or if the marriage had broken down.Health programmes received large additional
funds. The poorest were helped by increases in
the minimum wage, and Giscard also showed his
concern for the lot of the immigrants from North
Africa. Excessive state controls and administrativeintrusions into private lives, such as telephonetapping, were restricted.These liberal reforms met with much opposi-tion from the Gaullists in the National Assembly
and passed only with the help of the left. It wasclear to Chirac that his association with theseGiscard-inspired policies was bound to alienate
him from the Gaullist UDR. His break with the
president came in August 1976, when he resignedin protest against Giscard’s interference in gov-ernment and his increasing reliance on his ownElysée staff. The differences between them on
social and foreign policies, with Giscard more
intent on strengthening Western European coop-
eration and the institutions of the EuropeanCommunity, were real and deep. And of coursean independent Chirac was in a better position to
build up a political power base to displace Giscard
when the time came. Without Chirac’s help,
however, Giscard’s efforts after 1976 to push
through further social reforms were largely frus-trated.On the economic front Giscard was unfortu-nate to be in ofﬁce during the difﬁcult 1970s,
when the shocks of increasing oil prices in
1973–4 and 1979–80 seriously damaged worldtrade. Nothing like this had happened before andgovernments in the West were uncertain how best
to adjust economic policy. Giscard began in 1974
with a policy of austerity and deﬂation. Industrial
production dropped and unemployment rose to1 million. Then, in the characteristic stop–gopattern of the time, the policy was reversed in
1975 to counteract the recession. The result was
inflation and higher wages, which led to an
increase in imports and a deteriorating balance of
trade. Chirac’s successor as prime minister in1976 was Raymond Barre, who also held the postof ﬁnance minister. Barre did not come from the
ranks of National Assembly politicians, but was
economics professor at the Sorbonne and later
vice-president of the European Commission – abackground reminiscent of the highly successfulGerman ﬁnance minister of the 1950s, Ludwig
Erhard. Indeed, Barre took the German free-
market economy, with its minimum of govern-
ment regulation, as his own model.The Barre Plan began with savage austerity,which reduced inflation rapidly but inevitablyincreased unemployment. This was followed in
1978 by a step-by-step programme to free indus-
try from state regulations and directions. But
much tighter controls were exerted over state-sector industries: their subsidies were reduced andindustries in trouble were no longer bailed out.
The state, however, still directly oversaw the plan-
ning of what Giscard and Barre regarded as key866WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
sectors of industry. And because the dependenceon imported oil had revealed an energy weakness,France embarked on a massive expansion of its
nuclear-power resources, the most ambitious pro-
gramme in Europe. The national budget ceased
to be planned with large deﬁcits, and continuousdevaluation of the franc was no longer taken asthe easy option. The Barre Plan was starting to
work in 1978 and early 1979, with a favourable
trade balance, growth of industrial output, a
stable exchange rate and reduced inﬂation, but
the new Middle Eastern turmoil and the secondoil-price rise threw the economy off course.Inflation and unemployment rose; France was
sliding again into recession. The second dose of
Barre’s medicine of deflation, which caused a
further rise in unemployment, coincided in May1981 with the presidential elections.Politically, May 1981 marked a turning pointin French politics: the Socialists ﬁnally made the
breakthrough and captured not only the presi-
dency but, a month later, a majority in theNational Assembly elections as well. FrançoisMitterrand had beaten his rivals to the nomina-
tion and put forward a programme designed to
attract a combined left vote including that of the
communists. He presented a socialist manifesto
that promised to reduce unemployment, extendnationalisation, raise minimum wages, impose atax on wealth and carry through constitutional
reforms to reduce the power of an autocratic pres-
idency, which Giscard had been accused of
exploiting. The communist leader, GeorgesMarchais, had contested the ﬁrst ballot of thepresidential elections, but he had had to drop out
after failing to gain ﬁrst or second place, where-
upon he had placed his weight behind the
remaining socialist candidate Mitterrand in the
run-off election.On the right, President Giscard had beaten offthe challenge for the nomination from Jacques
Chirac, who led the substantial Gaullist wing of
the right coalition. In the second ballot, defec-
tions from traditional supporters of the right whowere antagonised by Giscard’s haughty presiden-tial style, and attracted by Mitterrand’s promise
to reverse the economic austerity programme, as
well as the backing of communist voters, gaveMitterrand a small but decisive majority overGiscard, of 15.7 million votes to 14.6 million.The surprise of the National Assembly elec-tions which Mitterrand called in June was the
large increase in support for the Socialist Party.
The Communist Party lost further ground. With
communist support in the National Assembly,Mitterrand commanded a substantial majority.The spectacular decline of Giscard’s UDF gave
leadership of the combined opposition on the
right to the hard-driving but not always pre-

dictable Chirac, who was distrusted by the UDF.
Thus the right was in considerable disarray.Mitterrand’s honeymoon lasted just over ayear. To maintain the broad support of the left
and centre, he included in his government adher-
ents from all groups. For the first time since
1947, four communist ministers were broughtinto the administration. Michel Rocard as minis-ter for planning represented the market-oriented
right wing of the Socialist Party and Prime
Minister Pierre Mauroy the traditional socialist
soft left. The government passed legislation to
strengthen civil liberties, a continuation of theefforts earlier made by Giscard. Mitterrand’s elec-toral promises of taxes on wealth and the raising
of minimum wages and welfare payments were
fulﬁlled. Decentralisation, the Deferre Law, gave
more power to elected regional councils, whilethe role of the centrally appointed prefects wasreduced. This shifted the balance of control and
local government signiﬁcantly, not that central
government was ready to give up its overall con-
trolling power. A large-scale nationalisation pro-
gramme was another pillar of Mitterrand’srigorous socialist programme. The nationalisationof leading armaments, metallurgical, electrical,
computer, chemical, pharmaceutical and insur-
ance companies and banks still in private hands1THE REVIVAL OF FRANCE867

brought almost a third of all industry into publicownership. (Less than 20 per cent had been inpublic ownership before 1982.)The most spectacular part of the Mitterrandprogramme was the attempt to counter the world-
wide recession caused by the oil-price rise with a‘socialist’ solution: a dash for growth that reversedthe Barre austerity plan. Many people in Britain at
that time, suffering from the sharp retrenchment
of Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government,
which cut a swathe through manufacturing
industry, looked with admiration on the boldMitterrand strategy. The ‘recovery plan’ pumpedmoney into the French economy, created jobs in
housebuilding and the civil service, raised the
income of the poorest in society and increased
investment in the public sector. It was acceptedthat higher taxes would not pay for this as well asfor nationalisation, but it was argued that in a
recession a large deﬁcit was acceptable until higher
demand expanded the economy again and
brought the deﬁcit down.It did not work. Unemployment rose to 2million and inﬂation soared once more above 15
per cent in October 1981; the deﬁcit forced a
devaluation of the franc, and the lack of conﬁ-
dence private industry felt for the Socialist gov-
ernment showed up in a shortage of investmentand production. In June 1982 Mitterrand madehis famous policy U-turn and switched to auster-
ity and public-spending cuts proposed by the
ﬁnance minister Jacques Delors. Public spending
was further curtailed in the spring of 1983.Socialist reforms were downgraded in July 1984,when the able young industry minister, the
undogmatic, technocrat Laurent Fabius, replaced
Mauroy as prime minister. The policy turned to
the centre, towards market-oriented reforms and
industrial modernisation. Not surprisingly thecommunist ministers resigned. The Frencheconomy recovered, thanks to the application of
policies not so very different from those of the
Giscard–Barre years. Higher productivity had
high unemployment as its trade-off, as it had inthe rest of Western Europe. Mitterrand acceptedthe price of unpopularity in the expectation that
an upturn would follow the austerity of 1984–6
in good time for the presidential elections due in1988. In an effort to improve the chances of theSocialists, whose popularity was plummeting, hepushed through an electoral reform, changing
from a ‘ﬁrst-past-the-post’ system to proportional
representation.The National Assembly elections in March1986 turned out better than expected for theSocialists, who remained the largest party, picking
up much support from former communist sup-
porters. The Communist Party fared disastrously,
losing a third of its votes. The broad-left coalition
(including the communists), had it been recon-structed, could command only 251 votes. Theright, despite the rivalries between Giscard’s 
UDF and Chirac’s RPR, enjoyed a clear major-
ity with 277 votes. What caused a real shock to
traditional French politics was the rise of a fascistNational Front party led by the barnstorming ex-paratrooper Jean-Marie Le Pen. Almost one in
ten voters had voted for this racist, anti-Semitic
party, turning their backs on the traditional parties
and placing their confidence in a leader who in the name of ‘patriotism’ attacked the NorthAfrican immigrants as foreigners who caused
white unemployment. Le Pen promised to bring
law and order back to France. The immigrants
would be forcibly repatriated.After the elections, the Fifth Republic founditself in an unprecedented condition, with aSocialist president and a National Assembly
dominated by the right. Unlike the government of
the US, where the executive president and those
appointed to the administration are separated fromCongress, the government of France is appointedby the president, but in order to function it must
command a majority in the National Assembly.In March 1986, Mitterrand called on JacquesChirac, who headed the largest of the parties of the868WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968

right, to form a government. Chirac did not havean easy task, forever looking over his shoulder atthe Giscard party in the National Assembly, whose
members disliked him intensely; they were never-

theless an indispensable part of his majority. He
also had in the Elysée a Socialist as his president.The French found a witty way to describe hispredicament – cohabitation. Chirac found no
room in the government for Giscard, who had
hoped to return to the Finance Ministry. Thus,
from the start, Chirac exposed himself not only to
the opposition of the left but also to jealousy fromthe UDF, which was largely excluded from power.Part of Chirac’s economic recovery programme
was not so different from that of the outgoing
Socialist government. But there was bound to be a
clash over his determination to privatise and dena-
tionalise state-owned companies. Though thepresident tried, he could not stop the privatisations
receiving the assent of the National Assembly.
Chirac also reversed the system of proportional
representation, to which the National Front hadowed their spectacular breakthrough nationally.With a return to ‘ﬁrst past the post’, the National

Front could not hope to gain many seats.The cutbacks imposed by the governmentwere not popular. In December 1986 a long rail
strike paralysed the French railways for nearly amonth. Strikes spread in January 1987 in thepublic sector and Chirac was forced to compro-
mise on pay and conditions. During the period
from 1986 to 1988, inﬂation, however, fell to
between 2 and 3 per cent.Mitterrand was able cleverly to project animage of standing above the parties and so
escaped blame for the government’s policies. His
message was that he represented a solid rallying
point for the nation. Meanwhile, students and
universities seethed in protest and unemploymentremained above 2.5 million. Chirac accusedMitterrand of excessive presidential interference
in government. The farmers, once protected by
the right, have since the 1980s had to face reduc-
tions in subsidies, increased competition and gen-erally harder times. As a ‘statesman’, Mitterrandmaintained a high proﬁle in foreign affairs, in par-
ticular playing a leading role at the European
Community summits. He also cultivated closerelations with the West German chancellorHelmut Kohl, thus strengthening the Bonn–Parisaxis; his relations with Margaret Thatcher, on the
other hand, were formal and cool. Mitterrand was
just as ﬁrm as his predecessors in maintaining
France’s independent nuclear strike force.When the time came for the presidential elec-tion in the spring of 1988, Mitterrand easily led
the ﬁrst ballot amid nine contenders; Chirac came
second. The real shock was that Le Pen had
secured over 4 million votes, 14.4 per cent of 
the votes, running fourth only just behind therespected and popular Barre. The second-ballotrun-off was a foregone conclusion, with Mitter-
rand substantially increasing his percentage share
of the votes, attaining 54 per cent to Chirac’s 
46 per cent (16.7 million votes to 14.2 million).Chirac resigned the premiership and Mitterrandchose the undogmatic market-oriented Michel
Rocard as his successor. He then dissolved the
National Assembly.The Socialists had scored a great success,though after the second round of voting for theNational Assembly they did not obtain an overall
majority, achieving with their affiliated parties
276 seats. In fact, the broad left and right coali-
tions were fairly evenly divided. With the National
Front reduced to one seat thanks to the aban-donment of proportional representation, with thecommunists unlikely to vote with the right, and
with the right divided, the centrist Socialist prime
minister, Rocard, enjoyed comfortable majorities
when voting took place in the Assembly. Rocard,who emphasised consensus in politics, was dullcompared to Laurent Fabius. He had no grand
plans, but he laid stress on solid achievement and
won public approval because most people were
tired of the right–left confrontations. The
economy continued on a ‘virtuous’ path, with agood rate of growth and low inflation. TheRocard government did not alarm private indus-
try and Mitterrand was clearly steering a more
central political course. But a tight control over
public-sector pay led to renewed strikes in theclosing years of the 1980s.Financial rectitude was accompanied by closeon 10 per cent unemployment, which stubbornly
persisted into the 1990s. Mitterrand’s France was1THE REVIVAL OF FRANCE869
beset by a political malaise. The Socialist Partysuffered from the deepening unpopularity of the
president, though he had long ceased to followtraditional socialist policies. Meanwhile, rivalryand friction between Chirac and Valéry Giscard
d’Estaing tarnished the appeal of the right.
Mitterrand hoped that replacing Rocard with
Mme Edith Cresson as prime minister wouldrestore the fortunes of the socialist government.But her approval rating sank fast. Essentially, eco-
nomic policy had not changed and there were no
signs of an expansion sufﬁciently strong to absorb
the unemployed.The issue that provoked most heat was theposition of the North African migrants. Jean-Marie Le Pen’s National Front based its strong
support largely on this widespread hostility to
Arab migrants, a community mainly poor and
concentrated in a few cities like Marseilles andParis. In 1991 ofﬁcial ﬁgures estimated that 4million migrants, mainly Muslim Arabs from
North Africa, lived in France. Their birth rate is
high and about 1 million children have been left
out of this census. Racism also extended to arenewal of anti-Semitism among the NationalFront, which managed to seem the only really
dynamic party in a stagnant political scene. In
regional elections in March 1992 the Socialist
Party gained only 2 per cent more votes than the
National Front (at 14 per cent). In April 1992,after less than a year, Mme Cresson was replacedas prime minister by Pierre Bérégovoy.The deep malaise in politics was also reﬂectedin the uncertainty over where France should be
heading in the 1990s. Once the enthusiasticfounding partners of the new Europe in closealliance with the Germans, the French people weredeeply divided in September 1992 when asked toapprove the Maastricht Treaty. The ‘yes’ vote was
only just sufﬁcient, and many people had voted in
favour not out of a feeling of enthusiasm for
Europe but rather for negative reasons. There wasa widespread fear of the newly united Germany of82 million. By a small margin the French people
decided that it was safer to keep Germany
hemmed in by European institutions, despite its
preponderant weight in such a union, instead of
leaving France to face an unfettered Germancolossus alone. But the biggest issue in France in1993 was the continued recession and unemploy-
ment. At the elections for the National Assembly
in March 1993 the Socialists (in power for twelve
years) were swept out of ofﬁce. The electoral sys-tem exaggerated the swing of seats. The Socialistslost 212 seats and were left with 70. Chirac’s RPR
now occupied 247 and Giscard d’Estaing’s UDF
213, the communists fell 3 to 23, the National
Front lost their only seat. Thus the right had an overwhelming majority in the 577-strongAssembly. Mitterrand chose Edouard Balladur 
of the RPR as the new prime minister for a new
period of ‘cohabitation’. But the French people
and the two rival aspirants, Giscard d’Estaing and
Chirac, were waiting for the presidential electionsand a chance to unseat Mitterrand himself.Mitterrand’s last years in ofﬁce were cloudedby rumours of scandal. Mme Cresson was not a
success as prime minister; she was followed by
Pierre Bérégovoy, who committed suicide amidallegations of corruption. There were questionsabout Mitterrand’s Vichy past and his post-war
friendships with collaborators. The economy had
stalled and his determination to keep in step with
Germany on the path towards European integra-
tion kept the French franc strong and unemploy-ment high. President Mitterrand had been inofﬁce for longer than any of his predecessors. It
was time for a change; moreover, he was termi-
nally ill and would only survive the forthcoming
presidential elections by a few months.In May 1995 Jacques Chirac became the newpresident. His promise to make the reduction of
unemployment a priority, to increase wages, to870WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968

protect social welfare payments – all withoutincreasing taxes – were too good to be true. Andso it turned out. But it was his prime minister,
Alain Juppé, who had to take responsibility for
unpopular measures. The strong franc continued
to hit exports. Unemployment remained toohigh. The changes essential to make industrymore competitive were blocked by massive trade
union protests in the streets of Paris. Only small
reforms were accomplished and the French
people tended to blame Maastricht and its strict
criteria for convergence to achieve the currencyunion for the mess France was in.In foreign relations Chirac revived Gaullist tra-
ditions only in some respects. The resumption of
nuclear testing in the South Paciﬁc earned France

worldwide protest and was a spectacular demon-
stration of independence. Chirac also followed amore robust independent policy in the Middle
East and elsewhere. Crucially, towards Europe
Chirac did not follow in the general’s footsteps.
He clearly supported efforts to fulﬁl the Maastricht
agenda for closer European union and Francerejoined the military command structure of NATO
in May 1996. However, he was ready to follow
independent policies in the Middle East and defy
the US by indicating his readiness to resume trade
with Iran. Whether Chirac really enhancedFrance’s standing and role in the world remainsquestionable. What was quite clear was that he
gave in to the massive protests of French workers
and state employees, and so was unable to deliver
his domestic agenda.France is far more prosperous than statisticswould imply. The French people enjoy the high-
est pensions and one of the most generous welfare
systems in the world. But the new economic con-
ditions of the global market mean that change is
now imperative. However, formidable resistance isencountered when any one group is hit byattempted reforms, whether they are middle-class
civil servants, lorry drivers or farmers; the French,
traditionally unwilling to defer to state authority,
do not hesitate to take direct physical actionagainst a government in Paris, which consequentlyﬁnds it difﬁcult to enforce unpopular legislation.At the general election in June 1997 theGaullists were punished for having failed todeliver on President Chirac’s promises of lowertaxes and unemployment. Gaullist supporterswere reduced from 477 to 256 seats and Lionel
Jospin and his allies gained 320 in the National
Assembly. It was now the turn of the socialists to
fulfil promises of 700,000 new jobs, higherminimum wages and a shorter working week.Jospin declared that the hardship involved in
meeting the Maastricht criteria was too great a
price to pay for monetary union. Chirac, com-
mitted to Maastricht now had to ‘cohabit’ with a
Socialist prime minister of a government com-posed of Socialists and communists. A clash ofpolicies seemed inevitable. It failed to materialise.
Once in power, Jospin allayed fears that France
had turned its back on the close partnership with
Germany and gave assurances that he was stilldetermined to meet the criteria.France, like Germany has taken a long hardlook at its past. The passage of time has made it
possible to explode the Gaullist myth that the real
France was embodied in the wartime Free Frenchmovement rather than in the Vichy regime. Thetruth is that it was not the previously unknown
junior general, de Gaulle, but the old Marshal
Pétain, the victor of Verdun, who was regarded
by the majority of French people as their saviour.
Vichy France had implemented Germany’s racialpolicies with indecent compliance, arresting andsending Jews to their deaths at the behest of the
Nazis. Of the 130,000 foreign Jews who had
sought refuge in France 52,000 were deported,
and of the 200,000 French Jews, 24,000 weresent east. Less than 2,000 returned. In 1997 theFrench government and the Church for the ﬁrst
time expressed a public mea culpa. However,many brave French people also hid Jews; the
majority, at least 230,000, were saved.France was once more governed, from 1997 to2002, by Chirac, a conservative Gaullist president,and Jospin a Socialist prime minister. The French
electorate quite liked ‘cohabitation’ that would
result in a centrist position promising no radical
change as president and prime minister checkedeach other. That was the theory. Prime MinisterJospin was no ideologue and was effective in a
quiet way. He took a pragmatic approach to
politics, perhaps surprising when his ﬂirtation with
1THE REVIVAL OF FRANCE871
the Trotskyists while a young politician came tolight. His education was solid, a graduate of theprestigious École Nationale d’Administration, he
joined Mitterrand’s Socialist Party in 1971 and
became education minister under Mitterrand.
Later, however, he distanced himself, disturbed bythe prevailing corruption that also envelopedPresident Chirac, allegedly, during the years when
he was a mayor of Paris. Though a Socialist, he
began a programme of privatisation of state indus-

tries such as Air France and French Telecom. Over
the ﬁve years of the Chirac–Jospin coalition therehad been a number of achievements to their credit.There were improvements in welfare provisions,
the government provided additional health bene-

ﬁts for the poorest people. Notable was legislation
allowing gay couples to form a union, the CivilSolidarity Pact, another reform was to encouragewomen’s parity in politics; the most notable legis-

lation was to reduce the working week from 39 to
35 hours to provide jobs for the young. Jospin
gave way to the opposition from trade unions andworkers who went on massive strikes of the publicservices in 1999, 2000 and 2001 defending their
pensions, jobs, wages and working conditions.
Little of a reform agenda was achieved, though
France urgently needed to move to more ﬂexible

labour, lower taxation, and an easing of the futurepension liabilities. The need for this was masked bythe success of the French economy during the ear-

lier years of his government until it, too, slowed.
Unlike in Germany, the economy grew robustly
and over one million jobs were created.In 2002 Jospin campaigned against Chirac forthe presidency. The results sent shock waves
through France. After the ﬁrst round he was just
beaten into third place by the extreme right-
winger Jean-Marie Le Pen. The split in his social-
ist support, the anti-immigrant vote for Le Penand low voter turnout were responsible for thedisaster. To demonstrate their opposition to Le
Pen, the socialists had now no choice but to back
Chirac, the lesser evil, in the second round. This
enabled Chirac to win by a landslide, 82 per centof the vote. In June 2002 at the elections for the National Assembly, Chirac’s party, the Union 
for the Presidential Majority, and his newly
appointed prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarinreceived solid support, winning 399 of 577 seats.The French electorate had opted for change, butwere they really ready for it?The French people in the new millennium dis-played a growing disinterest in national politics.
In the ﬁrst round of the presidential elections inApril 2002 three out of ten did not bother to voteand Le Pen received the protest anti-immigration
vote of 16.9 per cent. The ‘respectable’ parties
attracted less than half the voters. The people
were worried above all about the threat of crime
especially in the crowded city suburbs. The eco-nomy, which did well under Jospin, is slowing.Delivering one of the best health services in the
world and the most generous pension rights,
France is also over taxed, the population is
ageing, and painful change is all but inevitable.France until the turn of the millennium, however,beneﬁted from the booming American economy.
Even so unemployment remained high at 9 per
cent. The reforms that need to be tackled are: to
reduce the government’s still extensive control ofstate industries; to reduce the pension burden,which is potentially ruinous; and to cut back the
state’s take of the portion of the wealth produced
by the nation which requires high taxation and
dampens enterprise. Prime Minister Jean-Pierre
Raffarin made a cautious start avoiding thesudden way reform was attempted and aban-
doned in 1995. Even though all that was pro-
posed was that public sector workers and teachers
should, like the private sector, have to work for
forty years for a full pension, two and a half yearslonger than hitherto, and the change would nottake effect for ﬁve years, it was enough to bring
to the streets new waves of strikes in the spring
and summer of 2003 with the unions leading the
protest. But given the substantial majority in the
National Assembly, the government is likely towin through. Meantime, despite all the allega-tions of corruption in earlier years, Chirac enjoyed
unprecedented popular approval in 2003 for
leading the opposition to the US–British deter-
mination to war against Saddam Hussein. With itsveto power as a threat, Chirac, supported bySchröder and Putin, was able to frustrate Anglo-
American diplomatic efforts to win the support of
the UN for the war in Iraq. This plunged Franco-872WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
American relations to its depths. It is, however,no tenable long-term strategy. The EuropeanUnion cannot afford to continue an anti-
American stand, and with its relatively weak mil-
itary forces and divisions, Chirac’s vision of
Europe as a counterbalance to the US, lies at bestdecades in the future. Internationally Francedecreased rather than augmented its inﬂuence.
Chirac had to begin to mend fences once more.
At home too there is a long way to go before new
policies will show results. Chirac and Rafferin are
cautious, intent on winning the necessary supportfor their policies. They wish to persuade ratherthan bludgeon the opposition as MargaretThatcher did with the British miners. A new polit-ical star made his debut ﬁrst as interior minister
and then as ﬁnance minister, the dynamic and
pragmatic Nicolas Sarcozy. The economy in 2004
began to expand. France remains a prosperouscountry, with excellent welfare, but slum areas ofcrime surround its cities and racial tensions mar
sections of society. Sarcozy had to give up the
Finance Ministry in 2004 to become head of the
Presidential Majority Party (UMP). He has posi-
tioned himself as a credible challenger to Chiracas the next presidential elections in 2007.1THE REVIVAL OF FRANCE873
In the European Community agreement oncommon goals has frequently been reached only
after long-drawn-out negotiations and carefully
cobbled-together compromises. But the originalaim of the 1957 Treaty of Rome – that all obsta-cles which impeded the free movement of goods,
capital and services, such as insurance and
banking, within the Community of 360 million
people should be lifted – had still not been entirely
met in the early 1990s. The Europe of the twelvemembers of the Community was still ﬁssured bycustoms frontiers and blocked by mountains of
paper forms as well as hidden obstructions.
Nevertheless, the three major continental West
European nations – Germany, France and Italy –backed the drive for closer union. Britain wasmore reluctant to hand over control to the
Commission in Brussels, whose president from
1985 was the former French minister of ﬁnance,
Jacques Delors. Margaret Thatcher stood at the
forefront of those who believed that to elevatethe Commission as the ultimate source of powerwould be profoundly undemocratic and that the
European Parliament was too weak to play the
role of existing national parliaments.Which direction the European Community tookdepended on the decisions reached by the heads ofgovernment of its member states. It had always
been so and essentially it remained so in the early
1990s. This was not the intention of the founding
fathers, who wanted to move towards the closerintegration of Western Europe. They laid downthat, after an early stage during which unanimitywould be required in the Council of Ministers, the
‘qualiﬁed majority’ voting formula would come
into play. This meant that if France, Germany andItaly were agreed, the other three original mem-
bers – Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg –
would be outvoted. Moreover, the three smaller
powers acting together would not achieve enough
votes to get a measure passed unless they could
gain the agreement of at least two of the otherthree. In other words, neither Germany, Francenor Italy had enough voting power on its own to
veto a decision all the others were agreed upon. De
Gaulle scuppered any such notion of diminished
sovereignty in 1965: he boycotted the Communityfor seven months and returned only when the so-called Luxembourg Compromise was agreed on in
January 1966. This gave each member the right to
veto any decision affecting its vital national inter-

ests – and the interpretation of ‘vital national 
interests’ was left to the member state and couldinclude such matters as the price of barley.The successive enlargements of the EuropeanCommunity have altered the mechanics of ‘qual-
iﬁed majority’ voting, but the national veto was
still in place in the early 1990s. The periodicsummit meetings of the heads of government –accompanied, since 1974, by their foreign minis-
ters – were given the formal name of European
Council. They convene three times a year, and
their decisions set the guidelines. At the Councilof Ministers, more detailed agreements areChapter 75THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITYreached. The European Commission of civil ser-vants under the president and his ‘Cabinet’ ofsixteen nationally appointed commissioners also
has a powerful inﬂuence. It can initiate proposals
and then draw up amendments, but these require
the consent of the Council of Ministers who, inturn, take their instructions from their nationalgovernments. The European Parliament, directly
elected for the ﬁrst time in 1979, has the power
to dismiss the Commission but not to appoint
one. Its day-to-day powers are limited; it is a con-
sultative rather than a legislative parliament.There is also a court of justice.The Single European Act of 1987 limited theuse of the national veto by requiring that qualiﬁed
majority voting should be substituted for unanim-
ity in a number of important areas concerned withthe creation of a common market. But thenational veto was still applicable in other areas.A chronic Community problem centres aroundthe budget, which is contributed by member
nations. The main difﬁculty was the costly Com-mon Agricultural Policy (CAP), which absorbedtwo-thirds of total expenditure; a temporary difﬁ-

culty was the implementation of a 1980 undertak-

ing to reduce Britain’s excessive net contribution,
which arose because with its small farming sector it
received relatively little in the form of CAP subsi-
dies. Since it was one of the poorer countries in theEC, this was patently unfair. Margaret Thatcher
insisted in 1983 that the British government would
not sanction any increase in the Community’s
ﬁnancial resources unless a long-term solution wasreached to replace the annual haggling.In many ways Margaret Thatcher was out oftune with the ‘continental’ style of the Com-

munity, which Britain had entered too late. She
abhorred the Brussels bureaucracy and its pettifog-

ging regulations; she opposed the protectioniststance that the EC adopted towards world trade;above all she attacked the absurdities of the CAP
which, on the one hand, created huge and expen-

sive butter mountains and wine lakes to subsidise
the farmers out of taxation raised in member states,and, on the other, increased EC food prices aboveworld prices generally. A free-trader by conviction,
what she did support was the removal of trade bar-

riers between member states. But she remainedprofoundly suspicious of closer political union.The European Community institutions are un-democratic, and the one democratically elected
body, the European Parliament, lacks real power.
In any case, Thatcher was not ready to allow
European institutions to override the 700-year-oldParliament at Westminster. She regarded democ-
racy and parliamentary institutions on the conti-

nent as too recently established and not rooted in
tradition, as they were in Britain. What is more she
feared the overwhelming influence Germany
would be able to exert in a politically and eco-
nomically uniﬁed Community. All these views sheexpressed with a passion and directness that made
her seem the outsider, even when others might
secretly agree with her.Despite much acrimony and despite often giv-ing an impression of immobility the Communitytends to acquire sudden forward movement when
continuing crisis threatens its credibility. At the
Fontainbleau summit in June 1984, agreement on
the principal bones of contention was reached: the British obtained the long-term settlement oftheir budget contribution and the Community’s
resources were increased by undertakings to 
raise the level of VAT. In a move that was to 
prove of great significance in the 1990s, the
European Parliament in 1984 adopted a reportcalling for a new treaty to create a European polit-ical union.Much wrangling in 1985 was settled inDecember at the Luxembourg summit when it
was agreed in principle to adopt a Single EuropeanAct. This comprised two separate parts, one estab-lishing a treaty for political cooperation, and the
other amending the Treaty of Rome to remove all
existing obstacles to a free internal market by the
end of 1992, thus making the original vision of a
common market a reality. Clearly the two parts,‘politics’ and ‘trade’, could move forward atentirely different speeds. It was a far cry from the
European union which a majority in the European
Parliament wanted – though, as we have seen, the
Act also provided for an extension of qualiﬁedmajority voting.The dynamic but frequently tactless JacquesDelors, Commission president, had little success
in persuading Margaret Thatcher to agree to an1THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY875
increase in the powers of the Commission or tosupport the closer political integration of the ECmembers. For her part, Thatcher took the lead in
demanding reform of the CAP, though this made
slow progress. But in 1987 the Single European
Act was ratified by national governments andﬁnally adopted. The Community also acceptedcompromises on the budget on the basis of pro-

posals put forward by Delors, which involved
gradual reductions in the proportion spent on
agriculture. Further cuts were in prospect if pro-

duction of speciﬁed agricultural produce exceeded
set ceilings.As the decade drew to a close, the differencesbetween Britain and the rest of the Community
once more became accentuated. Britain favoured
the dismantling of barriers to trade and the cre-ation of a free market, but declined to join theEuropean Monetary System (EMS), which had
come into force in 1979, and therefore did not
participate in the Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM), which was designed to create currencystability. In September 1988 Delors chaired acommittee of experts to discuss European monet-
ary union. The outcome became known as the
Delors Plan, which the Commission president
submitted to member heads of government in
June 1989. It envisaged the creation of monetaryunion with a single currency. This was to beachieved in three stages. All member states agreed
in June 1989 to participate in stage one, the
drafting of a treaty on monetary union. But
Britain refused to begin the second stage, which– following signature of the treaty – would laydown the conditions to be met by member states
that would make possible the attainment of stage
three: monetary union with a single currency in
use throughout the Community.In opposing the moves towards monetaryunion, Margaret Thatcher found herself increas-ingly isolated not only in Europe but within 
her own Cabinet. It was her chancellor of the 
exchequer and her foreign secretary who insisted
at the Madrid summit in July 1989 that Britainshould formally accept the whole of the ﬁrst stagein principle. Margaret Thatcher continued to
oppose the goal of monetary union as it would
undermine national sovereignty, but in October1990 she was reluctantly driven to agree toBritain joining the system of ﬁxed exchange rates(the ERM). It transpired that John Major, then
chancellor of the exchequer, joined at too high 
a mark exchange rate. As Mrs Thatcher’s adviser
Sir Alan Walters had warned, the resultant highinterest rates in Britain deepened the recessionand increased unemployment.European political and economic union re-mained a goal for the 1990s, though it seemed
hardly realisable with the members’ economies still
so widely divergent. This became painfully clearwhen in September 1992 the Italian lira and theBritish pound came to be regarded by the currency
exchanges as overvalued. Speculation against the
two currencies overwhelmed the defences mount-
ed within the ERM and both currencies had toaccept the market’s judgement and leave the ERM.This meant that in effect they devalued against 
the previously ﬁxed rate. It was a healthy reminder

to politicians that in a free ﬁnancial world their

powers are limited. Nor did the Communitynations manage to speak with a common voice onall vital issues of foreign and internal affairs. The
realisation that such union might not be attainable
within the agreed timetable was resisted by the
political leaders who favoured it.Seven smaller but nonetheless prosperousWestern European countries which had not joinedthe European Community – Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Iceland, Austria, Switzerland and
Liechtenstein, members of the European Free
Trade Association (EFTA) – negotiated a treatywith the Community in 1991 to create in 1993 anenlarged European Economic Area of 380 million
people. In addition, Austria, Sweden, Norway and
Finland hoped to join the Community in January
1995. Switzerland too was expected to join those
in the antechamber until in a referendum inDecember 1992 the populace decided by a narrowmajority not to join. Swiss neutrality had tri-

umphed. Negotiations were likely to be com-

pleted before the mid-1990s, each country’s
special problems having been taken into account.Sweden and Switzerland were reluctant to aban-don their traditional neutrality. Sweden, after
shedding its socialist policies and government in
1991, embarked on the formation of a market876WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
economy to lift the country out of a deep reces-sion. Finland, also in recession in the early 1990s,found itself freed from its dependence on the
Soviet Union, whose collapse also meant that it
lost its best trade partner. Austria in 1992 replaced
a president, Kurt Waldheim, who had become aninternational embarrassment, and in the same yearits international reputation was greatly enhanced
by the generous way the small country opened its
doors to refugees from the former Yugoslavia. The
Community welcomed the possible accession of
the wealthier countries, which would help to pro-vide funds for the poorer Mediterranean membersand for Portugal.Fundamental problems remained to be solved.These included the reform of the Community
budget, and more particularly the need to curbfarm spending; the relationship to be developedwith the newly liberated nations of Eastern and
central Europe; and trade relations with the rest
of the world, especially the US, which demanded
a reduction of the Community’s protective barri-ers. It held up the ‘Uruguay’ round of negotia-tions to liberalise world trade through the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade begun
in 1986 and concluded in December 1993. The
main remaining obstacle was US congressional
approval before the agreement could come intoforce in 1995. Agreement also had to be reachedon the respective roles of the Community insti-
tutions, the relationship between the European
Parliament, the Commissioners and national gov-
ernments. There was a readiness among nationalgovernments to relinquish sovereignty to alimited degree.It appeared that a high point of cooperationhad been reached when in December 1991 theleaders of the Community as part of the Delors
Plan concluded a new treaty at Maastricht to
create an ‘ever closer union among the peoples of
Europe’. Britain led the opposition to the idealsof a ‘federal Europe’ and a single common cur-rency. Britain also opted out of the ‘Social
Chapter’, which sought to provide minimum
conditions and standards in the workplace for
employees. French, Dutch and Belgian support
for Maastricht was based to a large extent on adesire to ensure that the power of the recentlyuniﬁed Germany should remain ﬁrmly anchored
in European institutions. This view had the
enthusiastic support of Germany’s Chancellor
Kohl. John Major agreed, albeit with importantreservations, because he wished to keep Britain’splace of inﬂuence at the ‘heart of Europe’.Within a few months it turned out that theCommunity’s leaders were far ahead of their elec-
torates and had concluded a treaty difﬁcult to rat-ify and short of obvious popular appeal. Thethreatened loss of national identity and objections
to giving Brussels more central control underlay
misgivings. Ratification was finally achieved in
November 1993, when the European Community
became the European Union. The margins for rat-iﬁcation were slender in France and required tworeferenda in Denmark. In Britain it caused a seri-
ous rift in the Conservative Party. Britain opposed
moves to ‘closer union’, but had to give way when
in March 1994 the European Union offered toadmit Sweden, Norway, Austria and Finland whilerestricting the rights of members to block deci-
sions. Sweden, Austria and Finland joined on 1
January 1995 after holding national referenda.
The Norwegian people rejected the advice of their
government and voted against joining the Union.Three countries – Greece, Spain and Portugal– were for many years barred from applying to join
the European Community, not principally on
account of the economic difﬁculties which their

membership would arouse but because of theirpolitical systems. A fourth country, Turkey, an‘associate’ since the 1960s, still awaited a
favourable verdict in the early 1990s. Greece’s
treaty of accession was concluded in 1979 and it1THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY877

became a full member in 1981. It had onlyrecently returned to democracy after the collapseof the military junta in 1974. Although demo-

cratic government had a difﬁcult passage after

1974, membership of the European Community
was a strong support.The Greeks suffered more than any nation in thepost-war free world, the civil war from 1946 to
1949 causing widespread devastation. But that
conﬂict was followed by a period of conservative
parliamentary government under Field MarshalPapagos and the most durable politician of post-war Greece, Constantine Karamanlis. In 1963,
George Papandreou was able to form a liberal
reforming coalition until he was dismissed by
King Constantine after a dispute over who shouldcontrol the army. A group of extremist army ofﬁ-cers accused Papandreou’s Centre Union Party of
preparing the way for a communist takeover and
organised a coup in April 1967 ahead of the
planned general election. The dictatorial rule ofthe Greek colonels from 1967 to 1974 was a dis-astrous period for Greece. Abuses of human
rights, including torture, were rampant, and so
was corruption. The economy, which had been
doing well in the 1960s, deteriorated sharply. In
1974, beset by vociferous public demonstrationsand resistance following the ﬁasco of their Cypruspolicy and the shambles of army mobilisation, the
colonels’ junta collapsed.Cyprus, after a long struggle, had been grantedindependence in August 1960 and placed underthe guarantee of Greece, Turkey and Britain. Butthe power-sharing constitution never worked 
in the face of Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot
animosities. Conflict on the island led to the
despatch of a United Nations peacekeeping force
in 1964, and Turkey and Greece themselves cameclose to war. Ten years later, in July 1974, theGreek colonels organised a coup and forced the
president of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios, to ﬂee,
preparatory to bringing Cyprus under Greek con-
trol; the Turks reacted by invading and occupyingthe northern portion of the island, defeating theGreek Cypriots. An exchange of populations, with
200,000 Greek Cypriots leaving their homes in
the north, and Turkish Cypriots resettling there,effectively partitioned Cyprus. All efforts to unitethe two halves and reach a workable compromisebetween the two communities had failed by the
early 1990s, but the partition, with a UN force
patrolling the line between the two sides, had
ended the bloodshed.The Cyprus dispute led to strained relationsbetween two NATO allies Turkey and Greece.
But Greece’s attachment to NATO after 1974
was ambivalent, partly because it was widely
believed in Greece that the US had supported the
hated colonels. US bases and the US naval pres-ence in Greece were consequently very unpopu-lar, both with the conservative governments
headed by Karamanlis, who had opposed the
colonels from exile in Paris, and with the liberal
centre governments of Andreas Papandreou (sonof George Papandreou) in the 1980s.On his return from exile in 1974, Karamanlis,with true statesmanship, guided Greece back to
democracy, only for Andreas Papandreou’s
Panhellenic Socialist Party to win the election in1981, though his administration evinced littlesocialism. Papandreou had gained a reputation 
as an American-trained economist, but, as else-
where in the world, the shock of the oil-price rise
compounded Greece’s economic difficulties in 
the mid-1980s. In opposition, Papandreou hadbeen stridently anti-Common Market and anti-American; in government he acted with a greater
sense of responsibility. But by the end of the
1980s he and his ministers became implicated in
ﬁnancial scandals; his electoral support neverthe-less remained solid. Greek politics were alsoenlivened by his love affair with a former airline
stewardess thirty-five years his junior, pho-
tographed with a telephoto lens bare-bosomed on
the beach. Papandreou was seriously ill with heart
trouble at the same time. He subsequentlydivorced his wife, married his mistress and wasnarrowly defeated in the general election of 1989.
No party emerged as outright winner, and coali-
tion governments were succeeded in 1990 by a
conservative administration with a tiny majorityled by Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis.Reforms strengthened the economy after years of
socialist proﬂigacy but also caused hardship. The
elections in October 1993 returned Papandreou878WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
to power. The Cyprus question continued todisrupt its relations with Turkey. But as a memberof the Community it had received aid and gained
substantial advantages.On Papandreou’s death in 1996, CostasSimitis, a younger founder of the socialist PasokParty became prime minister and took the partyinto the elections of that year. The country had
become increasingly polarised with the revival of
the conservative New Democracy Party but Pasok
won a working majority of seats – 158 against
New Democracy’s 125. Greek politics, still linkedto the dynasties of a few families, however, cameto be dominated less by ideology and more by the
requirements of its membership of the European
Union. By taking Greece into the Monetary
Union, Greece had been forced to adopt prudentbudget policies. Austerity measures inevitablyproved unpopular. Simitis steered the politics of
his party to the centre, reforms to modernise and
make the economy more competitive were prag-
matic rather than ‘socialist’. He stated a modestaim of cutting unemployment down to 7.3 percent. Unemployment at over 9 per cent remained
the blackspot. But with the help of European
Union funds, ﬁscal discipline and liberalisation,
Greece’s economic growth rate became one of
the best in Europe between 3 per cent and 4 percent annually from 1997 to 2003 while the highinﬂation rate fell from 16 per cent to under 7 per
cent. With the stabilisation of the Balkans after
the Yugoslav wars, Greece, the most advanced
economy in the region, will beneﬁt further. A newfeature in Greece has been large-scale immigra-tion from its neighbours, happy to do more
medical work and proving a benefit to the
economy and less of an issue of public disquiet
than might have been supposed. Simitis aban-
doned Papandreou’s populist, nationalist anti-American tone; the policy toward Turkey is morepaciﬁc with Simitis and George Papandreou, the
highly regarded foreign minister supporting the
principle of Turkey’s admission to the European
Union. Greece was governed for nineteen out ofthe last twenty-two years by Pasok and partnerson the left. It required a small shift of voters dis-
contented by austerity and high unemployment
to bring New Democracy back into power in2004 as the eyes of the world were on Greecehosting the Olympic Games. In March 2004 thecentre-right New Democracy party broke Pasok’s
hold on power, won the elections and Costas
Karamanlis became prime minister.Spain joined the Community in 1986, a movemade possible by an astonishing decade of
change. In November 1975, the old dictator
Franco had finally died, wired up to many
machines in a vain attempt to prolong his life by
a few days. He had given Spain stability and,shrewdly, had not thrown in his lot with his fascisthelper Mussolini or with Hitler during the
Second World War. It was to his credit too that
he had not marched into Gibraltar during
Britain’s great crisis in 1940. That Spanish vol-unteers had fought on the Russian front withHitler was not held against him in the 1950s. He
survived the early years of international ostracism
and, with the onset of the Cold War, he began
to be rehabilitated by the US in 1950. Threeyears later in September 1953 the US gave aid inreturn for three bases and a mutual defence pact;
international forgiveness was extended when
Spain in December 1955 became a full member
of the United Nations. (Spain was not admitted
into NATO until 1982.)Franco’s Spain remained a repressive regime inthe 1950s, but during the 1960s reforms were
gradually introduced, military courts were abol-
ished and workers were granted a carefully limited
right to strike. Constitutional changes effected in1966 provided for the election of a minority ofmembers of parliament, though political parties
were banned. Franco enjoyed widespread popular
support and was seen as standing above the
Falange, the Church and the army, which were
locked in bitter conﬂict. The most serious threatto his rule came from ETA, the independencemovement of Basque nationalism. As his succes-
sor, Franco had groomed Prince Juan Carlos,
grandson of Alfonso XIII; Franco judged that a
return to a ruling monarch would be the bestguarantee for preserving conservative peace inSpain. Juan Carlos gave no sign during Franco’s
lifetime of the liberal and democratic role he
would crucially play after the caudillo’s death.1THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY879
During the three decades since the SecondWorld War, Spain had begun to modernise bothits agriculture and its industry. The progress made
since the 1960s had been considerable, aided by
the West European discovery of Spain as a holiday
playground. But democratic advance was by no means assured in 1975. King Juan Carlosappointed a moderate socialist, Adolfo Suárez, as
prime minister. Suárez restored parliamentary
democracy and permitted all parties, including the
communists, to compete in the general election of
1977. King Juan Carlos gave his ﬁrm backing todemocracy, and neither he nor the people wouldtolerate an army coup, such as was attempted in
1981. A further coup was threatened ahead of the
general election in 1982, which the Socialist Party
won, Felipe González becoming prime minister.González’s biggest success was the signature inJune 1985 of the treaty of accession to the
European Economic Community, which Spain
joined in January 1986. The second half of the
1980s was a period of sustained economic growth,as González followed orthodox economic policies– to the chagrin of his more socialist followers. In
1989 he won the general election for a third time
by a narrow margin. The economy has continued
to grow. One black spot in Spain’s astonishing
progress was the continuation into the 1990s ofsporadic terrorist attacks by the Basque extremists.But Spain was not alone in the Community in this
respect. In the early 1990s it shared the problems
of recession with the other members of the
Community, including high unemployment, andGonzález’s popularity fell.‘No gain without pain’ can be applied with avengeance to Spain, whose government, like
Italy’s, was determined to be accepted into the
Monetary Union. Bringing the public sector
deﬁcit down to 3 per cent required under theMaastricht Treaty led to high unemployment atwell over 20 per cent which could not be lowered
by more spending. With the defeat of González
and the Socialist Party in the general election of
March 1996 a new chapter opened in Spain’spolitics. José Maria Aznar led the ConservativePeople’s Party and formed a minority govern-

ment. By granting greater autonomy to the sev-
enteen regions he gained the support of the moremoderate Basque National Party and the main-stream Catalan Nationalist Party. He set out toimprove the economy, to tackle the deep-seated
economic and regional problems – endemic cor-
ruption and favouritism to special-interest groups.
Aznar was a former tax inspector, a small neatﬁgure, lacking the glamour of González. His ﬁrstterm in ofﬁce was extraordinarily successful in
changing Spain’s sluggish progress, privatising
state industries, reducing unemployment from
close to one in ﬁve to a still high one in seven,
reforming labour laws and ensuring that prudentbalance of state expenditures and income met thelimits set by a member of the Monetary Union in
1999. Spain took advantage of benign world eco-
nomic conditions to achieve a high growth rate
and shook off completely the shadow of therepressive Franco dictatorship. With Cataloniaand its vibrant city of Barcelona a workable
accommodation was reached. In the Basque
region while the Basque regional government of
moderates did not seek independence, the terror-ist ETA did not abandon bombings. Tensionsremained high. In foreign relations Aznar
defended national interests in the European
Union protecting the regional aid Spain enjoyed.
Despite long negotiations no settlement was
reached on the future of Gibraltar, whose popu-lation would have no truck with any kind of jointsovereignty deal. Along with the rest of conti-
nental Europe, the Spanish people were opposed
to war with Iraq in 2003, but Aznar ignored
public feeling and was notable as the onlyWestern European leader to stand ﬁrmly backingBlair and Bush. Aznar can look back on a suc-
cessful tenure of government even though unem-
ployment still remained too high and regional
problems unresolved. Aznar was expected to win
the elections of March 2004 before handing overto his successor. The Madrid train bombings on11 March killing 191 people and injuring more
than 1,000 changed all that. Aznar was too quick
to try and lay the blame on ETA. The Socialists
(PSOE) won and José Luis Rodriguez Zapaterobecame prime minister. He reversed Aznar’s Iraqpolicy and brought Spain’s troops home. Socially
more liberal, for example recognising gay mar-
riage, less tolerant of the privileges of the Church,880WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
he is not a radical who will rock the economicboat which has given Spain sound growth (3.2per cent annually) and halved unemployment to
a still high 11 per cent. He has also realigned
Spain more closely again with France and
Germany in the European Union. Spain in thenew millennium is a vibrant free democracyattracting to its sunshine coasts millions of
tourists and much investment. The Franco years
are slipping into history.Portugal joined the European Community at thesame time as Spain. But its transition to democracy
was far more traumatic. Antonio Salazar was
Europe’s most enduring dictator, ruling from
1932 to 1968, when a stroke incapacitated him
and the right-wing regime of Marcello Caetano
took control for six years. As dictators go, he was
relatively mild, imprisoning rather than executing
his opponents, and during the Second World War
he had actively assisted the Allied cause. After
1945, therefore, he remained in relatively good
standing, even though he had a secret police and a
card-index system concerning his opponents which
was borrowed from the Gestapo. In 1970 Salazardied. The revolution that broke out in April 1974was not democratic in intent but was organised 
by army ofﬁcers disillusioned with the wars in
Portugal’s African colonies of Mozambique and
Angola. It took a curious turn when radical army
groups entered an alliance with the communists. 
A general election was held in April 1975 and the
Socialist Party gained most support; the commu-

nists lost out. Mario Soares became prime minister
until his replacement in 1979 by a centre–right
coalition. By then, democratic parliamentary rule
was ﬁrmly established – despite their great poverty,
the Portuguese people had not turned to the com-

munists. After the election of 1983, Soares againheaded a government coalition of Socialists andthe centre, which successfully implemented eco-

nomic reforms, making state enterprises more
efﬁcient and encouraging the private sector; of tra-

ditional socialism there was little.From having no elections, Portugal now hadtoo many. Party manoeuvres led to the fall of
Soares in 1985 and another general election. Inthe following year, the country’s kaleidoscopicpolitics required the election of a new presidentand, after more party manoeuvrings, the ofﬁce
was won by Soares, who thereupon resigned from
the leadership of the Socialist Party. The govern-
ment of Portugal after 1985 rested on the supportof the Social Democratic Party which, once it hadgained an overall majority in the election of 1987,
set itself the task of reversing socialist state control
of industry. Prime Minister Cavaço Silva ‘cohab-
ited’ amicably with the Socialist President Soares,
who was re-elected with an overwhelming major-ity in January 1991. The following OctoberCavaço Silva’s Social Democratic Party scored a
second electoral victory with an impressive overall
majority endorsing ‘cohabitation’.During the 1980s Portugal made considerableeconomic progress, as governments turned fromsocialism to a market-oriented economy. All pre-

tence that Portugal was in a ‘transition to social-

ism’ and was committed to becoming ‘classless’
was dropped from the new constitution of 1989.Its gross national product per head of $2,020 in1978 had tripled by the early 1990s. Since the
mid-1980s Portugal had achieved a remarkable
degree of political stability and economic progress,
and was an enthusiastic member of the European
Community. Portugal suffered along with othermembers of the EU from sluggish growth in itsclosing years of the 1990s, inﬂation increased well

beyond the Monetary Union’s target and corrup-

tion scandals weakened Silva’s position. Intended
reforms of the over-large, protected and paddedadministration remained to be undertaken.After a decade in power the electorate waslooking for a change. Silva’s centre-right Social
Democratic Party was convincingly defeated in
1995 by the Socialist Party and Antonio Guterres
gained the premiership. His ﬁrst four years inofﬁce saw his popularity rise. Portugal was bene-fiting from good economic growth and low
unemployment. Membership of the European
Union was proving of great beneﬁt. In 1999,
despite fears that Portugal would not be able tomeet the conditions of the common currency,Guterres was able to take Portugal in. This
marked the height of his popularity and in the
elections of 1999 the Socialist Party increased its1THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY881
majority. In March 2002, elections held prema-turely, gave the Social Democratic Party a narrowvictory and to the leader of the opposition, José
Manuel Durâo Barroso, as prime minister, now
fell the difﬁcult legacy of reform, until 2004 when
he was chosen to succeed Romano Prodi as pres-ident of the European Commission.Turkey applied for full membership of the Com-
munity in 1987. Two years later, the Community
replied that it was deferring consideration of further applications until after 1993, though itoffered the sop that Turkey was eligible. Greece, as
a member of the Community, remained deeply
suspicious of Turkey, though their relationsimproved after a low point in 1987. Nevertheless,the Cyprus question continued to stand in the way
of a normal cordial relationship. Turkey’s human-
rights record was also suspect and its economytended to ﬂuctuate wildly between growth andstagnation. The Kurds represent a serious minority
problem and the Asia Minor region of the country
is not only poverty-stricken but practically undermilitary rule. The economy, too, is backward.Kemal Ataturk had set up State Economic Enter-

prises in the 1920s and 1930s to modernise
Turkish industry, but by the early 1990s they hadbecome outdated and unproductive. With itsrapidly increasing population of 57 million in
1990, Turkey’s gross national product per head,
estimated at $1,870, was that of a Third Worldcountry, far less than Greece’s and even that ofPortugal, the poorest country in the Community.
Nor was parliamentary democracy absolutely
secure. The army was faithful to the Ataturk tradi-
tion and kept a watchful eye on the civilian politi-
cians, periodically making itself responsible for
holding the country together.In May 1960 the army seized power and theformer prime minister Adnan Menderes was exe-cuted a year later. When a resumption of civilian
politics in the 1960s and 1970s was again accom-
panied by growing disorder and economichardship, another army takeover followed inSeptember 1980. In November 1983 there was
then a return to semi-civilian parliamentary gov-
ernment, accompanied by much political repres-sion of liberals and socialists; martial law remainedin force under the conservative prime ministerTurgut Özal. He instituted some vigorous eco-nomic reforms and privatisations, and graduallyreturned Turkey to a more normal political state,
but the parties contesting for power remained
unstable.Özal sought to lessen tension with Turkey’sneighbours, especially Greece. His main aim was
to gain full membership of the European Com-
munity, to continue the military and economic
aid that the US had steadily sent to a valuable allyduring the Cold War. Turkey was also an import-ant player in the Middle East. In November
1989, Özal enhanced his stature by becoming
president, but the economy rapidly deteriorated
again. Turks ﬂed from Bulgaria in 1989. In April
1993 Özal died. The biggest internal problemthat faced his successors was the armed struggleof revolutionary Kurds.The elections of 1995 and 1999 did not curethe roundabout of ineffectual coalition govern-
ments of old-guard politicians. The most notableevent of 1999 was the capture of AbdullahOcalan, leader of the guerrilla Kurdistan Workers
Party (PKK) which had waged a ruthless struggle
for independence resulting in at least 30,000
deaths. His ﬁght was nourished by the suppres-
sion of Kurdish rights to their own language andeducation and the brutality of the army. Thehuman-rights abuses inﬂicted on even the mod-
erate 12 million Kurds remained one of the bars
to Turkey’s wish to join the European Union.
The generals in the National Security Councilguard the secular state and have required politi-cians to follow their guidance. Democratic devel-
opment is opposed by a coalition of interests –
army, police, security services and bureaucracy
blocking reform. The economy suffered fromhigh unemployment and the precipitous loss ofthe value of the currency with inﬂation annually
of over 50 per cent. Corruption and mismanage-
ment were endemic. But Turkey has been a
staunch NATO ally in the Cold War and after and
was assisted with loans from the US. Relationswith Greece remained tense, the Turkish occupa-tion of northern Cyprus since 1974, a major
obstacle. Turkey’s 67 million people seemed to
be caught in a political and social pattern resist-
ing fundamental change. The door of the882WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968
European Union remained frustratingly closed.Would progress at home continue to be stymied?In Turkey there was suddenly fresh hope ofhuman-rights reforms during the early years of the
new millennium. The elections held in November2002 resulted in a political earthquake. The oldparties and their leaders did not gain enough votes
to hold a single seat in the parliament. The voters
had turned to a new party founded in 1997, theconservative Justice and Development Party, akfor short meaning white or clean, which gained a
large overall majority and so could govern withouthaving to rely on coalition partners. It was led byRecep Tayyip Erdogan, a former mayor of
Istanbul. He had earned the suspicion of the gen-
erals for his earlier Islamist Party association.Imprisoned for four months on a pretext, he wasat ﬁrst barred from politics and the premiership, so
his nominee for the ﬁrst few weeks held the post
for him. Erdogan promised reform and to followa pro-Western secular policy that would make itpossible for Turkey to join the European Union.
Early on, reforms were passed by parliament, the
Kurds were granted rights to language and educa-tion, there had already been increasing economicinvestment in Asia Minor to win over Kurdish
moderates, and the generals in 2003 promised to
respect the wishes of the Turkish electorate. Thedire state of the economy was the most seriousproblem facing Erdogan’s administration in 2003.
The situation was not helped when, despiteErdogan’s urgings, parliament narrowly refused togrant a right of passage to US troops wanting to
open a northern front in the Iraq war; the US
retaliated by withholding loans. After the war,relations mended and an IMF loan linked to areform programme came to the rescue. The failure
of the long-drawn-out UN-sponsored mediation
efforts in the spring of 2003 to reunite Cyprus wasdisappointing. The generals remained opposed.Forty thousand Turkish troops are on the island,
but even on the divided island the situation eased
when the ‘green line’ was opened in April 2003 byRauf Denktasch the Turkish Cypriot leader per-mitting Greek Cypriots to visit their former
homes. Greek Cyprus joined the European Unionin May 2004; the island remained divided; theTurkish Cypriots’ northern population were left
outside although they had voted for the unionplan. With the new government in Ankara rela-tions with Greece improved, but Cyprus remainedan obstacle. Unless the Turks recognise Cyprus,
the Greek-Cyprus government threatened toblock accession talks. Erdogan’s reforms andpromises of further reforms took Turkey one step
nearer in 2004 to join the European Union when
agreement was reached to open accession negoti-ations. There was still a long way to go. It will takeat least ten years before Turkey will be judged to
have been able to meet all the political, economic
and human-rights criteria and much can happen in that time. Some members, especially France,harboured strong misgivings over admitting
another poor nation of over 70 million mainly
Muslim people and extending the EU’s frontiersinto the volatile Middle East. But neglectingTurkey’s claims would undermine its reforms.The Democratic German Republic, of course, wasbarred from the European Community, but WestGermany was allowed to extend trading beneﬁts
to it. With the death of the DDR and its incor-poration into a united Germany in 1990, the ter-ritory became a part of the EC without, of course,
adding to the number of members.One of the major achievements of the EuropeanCommunity was the strengthening of democracyin the poorer nations of the West – Spain, Portugal
and Greece. Membership of the club is open only
to countries that respect civil rights and abjuretotalitarian forms of government. Once broughtin, no country has suffered a relapse, and such an
eventuality is difﬁcult to imagine. Thus, not only

has the European Community become an associa-
tion promising greater prosperity to the poorerWest European nations, but it is also a powerful
bastion of freedom in the world.The habit of close cooperation and negotiatedsettlement of differences has become the norm ofnational relations within the Community. With
the removal of trade barriers, 1 January 1993marked the beginning of a new phase of increas-ingly close Community cooperation in the sphere
of trade to the beneﬁt of the 340 million people
whose countries are its members.France and Germany, leading an inner group,were urging closer cooperation to be spearheaded
by supplementing the Common Market with a1THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY883
common currency. The Delors Plan of how toachieve a monetary union, endorsed by the leadersof the Community in 1989, gestated for a decade
before becoming a reality on 1 January 1999. Thebarriers set up to prevent any member that did notmeet certain criteria from being eligible to join
were an essential aspect. Of especial importance
was the Stability and Growth Pact (1997) whichthreatened penalties if any member exceeded adeﬁcit limit of 3 per cent on its annual budget.
The Germans especially did not want to exchange
their stable mark for a euro that could be devaluedby the reckless state expenditure of one country. A European Central Bank has administered and
decides on the interest rate common to all its
members. With the turbulence of the world econ-omy and the slow growth rates it did not look asif the necessary convergence would be achieved to
allow monetary union to go ahead on time. Was
the hurdle set too high? It was typical of the his-
tory of the European Community which, since1992, had become the European Union, that dif-
ﬁcult goals were achieved often as time threatenedto run out. On 1 January 1999 the MonetaryUnion became a reality. Greece was not consid-
ered to have met the criteria; Britain, Denmark
and Sweden decided not to join; the other elevenmembers, Austria, Belgium, France, Finland,Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain became the
founding members; and in 2000 Greece wasadmitted. The early years in the new centuryrevealed difﬁculties. The same interest rate proved
too high for some and too low for others. The
euro lost value on the international exchange, butthe devaluation was beneﬁcial at a time of sluggisheconomic growth. The Stability and Growth Pact
insisted on by the Germans proved a handicap in
managing economies in difﬁcult periods and is toocrude in its operation. Consequently, observanceof it has been fudged especially by the two largest
economies of Germany and France who breachedthe 3 per cent budget deﬁcit. But judged overall,the euro has been a success, binding the European
Union more closely together though Britain,
Sweden and Denmark in 2004 still remained out-side the Monetary Union.The second most important development in thelater 1990s and the early twenty-ﬁrst century has
been the enlargement, to expand the EuropeanUnion by admitting in May 2004 ten new mem-
bers: Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary,
Slovenia, Malta, Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania and
Latvia. The negotiations have been long andtough. The new members will not secure equalbeneﬁts of membership before 2006. In particular,
they will receive only a quarter of the farm subsi-

dies paid to the older ﬁfteen. Their markets after
transitional agreements run out will be thrownopen to competition which will beneﬁt the more

efficient and bankrupt the less competitive.
Farmers are most likely to suffer. In the long term,however, to be an integral part of the EuropeanUnion is likely to prove as beneﬁcial as it did for

the once less developed members, Spain, Portugaland Ireland. Bulgaria and Romania are not in theparty but have crossed the ﬁrst threshold and
Turkey, the biggest problem, is knocking on the
portals.Ever closer union has proved a difﬁcult path topursue. The institutions of the European Union
are still developing. The Commission in Brussels
has come under particular criticism for its ineffec-tual control of funds handed out to memberstates. Fraud was endemic and annually criticised
by the auditors. A crisis point was reached in 1999
when the European Parliament ﬂexed its musclesand the whole Commission resigned. Promises ofeffective reform under its new president Romano
Prodi still remain to be fulﬁlled in 2004. Another
problem is to achieve more democratic controlover decision-making.The European Parliament has gained moreinﬂuence under the treaties of Amsterdam (1997)and Nice (2000), but this clashes with the deter-mination of the leaders of the member states to
retain ultimate control of crucial decisions in the
Council of Ministers. 884WESTERN EUROPE GATHERS STRENGTH: AFTER 1968

GLOBAL CHANGE: FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
In 1989, a wave of popular revolutions trans-formed Eastern and central Europe. Communism
was swept away. The Soviet Union withdrew.
Only ten years earlier the Warsaw Pact and Sovietdomination of central and Eastern Europe had stilllooked solid and unshakeable. There were difﬁcul-
ties, of course. Romania was showing signs of
nationalist independence; its communist leader
Nicolae Ceaus¸escu was much admired in the West,
which courted him assiduously much to its later embarrassment. In Bulgaria, the GermanDemocratic Republic, Hungary and Czecho-
slovakia, the communist regimes had proved
durable, though the last two countries had to be
brought into conformity with tanks and guns. Fortwo generations now the people of EasternEurope had known nothing but communism, and
those aged forty-ﬁve years and older had known
only different forms of authoritarian rule before
the Iron Curtain descended. The communist lead-
erships had claimed that they had made greatsocial and economic advances; a golden futurebeckoned; hardship and suffering were only tem-
porary, the means to greater virtue and prosperity.One supposed virtue was that worker andpeasant solidarity had replaced destructive bour-geois nationalism. The Soviet alliance, peoplewere told, guaranteed their protection from
German revanchism. This seemed to justify the
stationing of the Red Army in their countries.
Only the Romanians in 1958 succeeded inridding themselves of their unwelcome Sovietguests. But all the Eastern-bloc national forcesrelied mainly on Soviet weapons. The economic
exploitation of the satellites, a feature of the
Stalinist post-war years, had long ceased. Indeed,the Soviet Union was now subsidising the EastEuropean economies in the 1980s to a signiﬁcant
extent, at some sacriﬁce to itself. Oil and raw
materials were supplied at less than world prices.
The goods manufactured in Eastern Europe,
moreover, were of a design and quality that forthe most part were unsaleable anywhere else but in the Soviet Union. Of course the USSR,
because of its sheer size, dominated trading rela-
tionships. It is also notoriously difﬁcult to evalu-
ate the advantages and disadvantages of theSoviet-led Council of Mutual Economic Assis-
tance (Comecon) on the basis of price calcula-
tions. And if the Eastern Europeans had not
found a ready market for their goods and had to
ﬁnd a market in the West, would that not have
made them more competitive? In the end theyfound themselves linked to a collapsing Sovieteconomy and, when that link was cut, faced eco-
nomic collapse themselves. Little reliance can be
placed on the statistics of economic ‘progress’
published by the regimes, although they werecarefully analysed by economic experts in theWest. In any event, they show a precipitous fall
from the 1970s to the end of the 1980s.What can be measured is the increasing indebt-edness of Eastern Europe to the West. With thereduction of East–West tension, loans had become1Chapter 76THE IRON CURTAIN DISINTEGRATES

the East Germans, whose debt increased from
$1.4 billion in 1971 to $20.7 billion in 1988.
They were fortunate: their debts were assumedby the Federal Republic. The Poles ($1.1 billiondebt in 1971) groaned under a debt of over $48.5
billion in 1991, and the Hungarians suffered from
massive foreign debts, the highest amount per
head. The only ‘virtuous’ country was Romania.
By draconian measures, which drove much of thepopulation below any tolerable living standard,Ceaus¸escu had, by the time of his fall in 1990,
paid off his country’s debts, which totalled $10
billion in 1981. Neither he nor his family shared
the austerity he imposed on his countrymen: theylacked nothing in the way of imported Westernluxuries. In this respect he was only an extreme
example of Eastern European communist leader-
ship, all of which did very well out of commu-

nism and Soviet protection.The corruption was obvious and open. But theregimes also had a large privileged clientele who
beneﬁted from their continuing in power. The
host of bureaucrats needed in the central planning
ministries, the ofﬁcers in the army, the secret

police and the party, and trade union functionar-ies, all had a vested interest in upholding the com-munist state system. Now and then, at worst, one
leader might be replaced by another, but in the
1970s and 1980s there were remarkably few
changes in the upper reaches of the communistleadership. Poland, in the wake of the Solidaritycrisis of 1979 to 1982, was something of an
exception. The election of a Polish cardinal, Karol
Wojtyla, as Pope John Paul II in 1978 greatly
encouraged the Polish people in their resistance
to communism. His visit to Poland in 1983 afterthe suppression of Solidarity prompted a massivedemonstration of resistance and independence.
But few foresaw the collapse of communist rule
in Eastern Europe much before it happened. The
impact of the year of revolution, 1989, was there-fore all the greater.Withhindsight it is possible to discern the roots
of that revolution, the discontent of the masses
that boiled over, and the reason why the commu-nist leaders were afraid to resort to bloody repres-sion – why, had they tried to do so, the forcesready to do their bidding were no longer strong
enough. It was the mass of the people who rose
against the leadership. Not only intellectuals and
dissidents but hundreds of thousands of formerlygood communists turned on a system they hadpreviously supported. In the face of realities, of
oppression and of falling living standards, they
became utterly disillusioned. Once they realised
they were no longer a small group that could be
harried, beaten and imprisoned, the people beganto lose their fear of the state. Increasing contactswith the West in the 1970s and 1980s rendered
the contrast in living standards even starker. What
fanned discontent, however, were not just poor
living standards and dwindling hopes of a betterfuture but the growing recognition that their lead-ers and the whole communist system of repression
and economic management were the cause of
their troubles.The new thinking stimulated by Gorbachev inthe Soviet Union spread to the smaller nations ofEastern Europe with electrifying effect after 1987.
The communist leaderships could not adjust
themselves to realities. They remained cocooned,
brainwashed by their own ideology and propa-
ganda. There is no better illustration of this thanCeaus¸escu’s last appearance on 22 December
1989, on the balcony of his palace, unable to
make himself heard over the catcalls of the crowd
gathered in the square below. The complete
bewilderment of a once all-powerful man, whoseonly experience for years had been hero-worshipand the sound of sycophantic clapping in unison,
showed on his face in television pictures beamed
around the world. Even on the day the opposi-
tion stood him and his hated wife Elena against
a wall to be shot, they were both convinced thatthe people loved them. It was Christmas Day.Absolute power not only corrupts, it also blinds.Until the year of revolution, the communistleaderships had felt sufﬁciently secure to assert a
measure of national independence from Sovieteconomic and political control. To that extent,the Gorbachev phenomenon was welcome. He
promised, in April 1985, a month after coming to
power, to accord full respect for the sovereignty of1THE IRON CURTAIN DISINTEGRATES889
the Eastern European nations that uphold ‘social-ist internationalism’. That sounded like a softerversion of the Brezhnev Doctrine, not a repudia-
tion of it. The regimes went on believing that the
communist state was safe and would, if the need
again arose, be defended by the Red Army, as ithad been in East Germany in 1953, Hungary in1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. It dawned on
them only slowly, if ever, that Gorbachev was
ready to abandon them if that was the will of the
people.By the time of the Twenty-Seventh PartyCongress in February and March 1986 Gorbachevhad moved on and was urging much more 
radical political reform in the Soviet Union. By
September, he was telling the people of Krasnodar
that the ‘essence of perestroika... is for people to
feel they are the country’s master’. In 1987 and1988 he reshaped Soviet foreign policy, deter-
mined to win the support, trust and economic
help of the West. His new foreign minister,
Eduard Shevardnadze, gave him his enthusiasticbacking and put forward to the Central Commit-tee of the Soviet Communist Party in February
1990 an important reason for this revolution in
the Soviet Union’s policies: ‘It is only through
extensive international co-operation that we will
be able to solve our most acute domestic prob-lems.’ Soviet-led repression in Eastern Europewould irreparably harm the more important new
Soviet interests. Like other imperial powers, the
Soviet Union had reached the point where the
burdens of empire, and its negative effects onSoviet relations with the rest of the world, far out-weighed the advantages. In the missile age, terri-
torial buffers no longer provided protection; the
‘military imperative’ of the immediate post-war
years had vanished too.The prop that had held up national commu-nist regimes in Eastern Europe – the popularbelief that their communist leaders were at least
better than a Soviet occupation and direct Soviet
rule – had been knocked away. In 1989, the pos-
sibility of Soviet intervention was no longerfeared. And without the Red Army behind them,the national people’s armies of conscripts could
no longer be relied on to support the regimes
against their own people.One by one the reasons for the revolutionsthat swept through Eastern Europe in 1989became clear. The nucleus of a dissident leader-
ship was somewhat uncertainly in place in
Hungary, Romania and East Germany; there was
a more entrenched one in Czechoslovakia, wherethe Charter 77 group had a long history ofprotest; and Solidarity in Poland was already a
power in its own right. Crucial also was the dis-
illusionment of the masses with the economic sit-
uation and with the whole decaying system. The
leadership elite knew that it could no longer saveitself simply by changing the man at the top. Therevolt began with the young. The feeling, soon
all pervading, that the Iron Curtain was full of
holes, that it could no longer separate the angry
people from the centres of power in East Berlin,Prague, Budapest or Soﬁa, any more than it couldprevent people in the East from contacting the
West, was intoxicating. On 9 November 1989,
the Berlin Wall, that potent Iron Curtain barrier,
fell before an onslaught of the people. It was assymbolic an event as the fall of the Bastille.The ﬁnal rot had begun ten years earlier in theLenin Shipyard in Gdan
´sk. The Solidarity move-
ment had spread until it had gained the support
of half of Poland’s adult population. With theGdan´skagreement concluded between the
Solidarity leaders and the government in 1980,
the stranglehold of the Polish Communist Party
appeared to be broken. The support for Solidarity
had a variety of roots; repeated economic failuresduring thirty-five years of communist rule,working-class and intellectual resistance to a
single-party authoritarian state, nationalism and
Catholic rejection of atheistic communism – these
together provided a fertile soil for the growth of
a broad opposition. Solidarity was a party in allbut name, and, in the year during which it wasallowed to function as a free trade union move-
ment, recruited 10 million members. The morale
of the Communist Party collapsed as communists
also switched to Solidarity.As the economy slumped further, GeneralJaruzelski became the new party leader and
declared martial law on 13 December 1981.
Fearing Soviet intervention, the conscript Polish890GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
army obeyed him. There was some sullen relief,but protest strikes also broke out, harshly sup-pressed at the cost of a number of deaths and
injuries. With the Communist Party now a broken
reed, Jaruzelski formed the Military Council of
National Salvation. Solidarity was outlawed, hun-dreds of its members were arrested, including fora short time Lech Wae¸sa, and the rest of the lead-
ership was driven underground. Yet the attempt
to obliterate Solidarity proved a total failure. The
electrician Wae¸sa did not sink back into obscurity
but was internationally celebrated with the awardof the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983. The over-subsidised command economy failed to respond
to economic medications applied by the commu-
nists, and US economic sanctions and rejection by
the West isolated the regime until 1983. Theworkforce was not to be inspired by military orcommunist appeals to work harder. A particularly
shocking example of the brutality prevailing under
the regime was the abduction and murder by 
the Interior Ministry’s security forces of a popularradical priest, Father Jerzy Popieluszko, whosechurch had become a focus for the opposition.Gradually Jaruzelski relaxed military rule andthe majority of Solidarity activists were released
from jail. But attempts by Jaruzelski to improve
the economy by cutting subsidies provoked newstrikes in 1988. The people were not prepared toaccept such measures from a regime that kept
itself in power by force. The authorities knew that
national malaise and economic crisis could not be
overcome without the cooperation of the oppo-sition. And so in February 1989 began the‘round-table talks’ between the military commu-
nist regime and opposition groups, including
Solidarity. The constitutional reforms agreed by
April that year ended one-party rule. Solidarity
was permitted to emerge as a political party – thatwas a far-reaching concession. Czechoslovakiahad been invaded in 1968 when Dubcˇek had con-ceded as much. This time, Gorbachev had made
it clear that the Eastern European nations could
follow their own road of development.The concession Solidarity made was that in thelower house of the Polish parliament, the Sejm,
65 per cent of the seats would be reserved for
the Communist Party and only 35 per cent wouldbe contested. A senate was created as well, whichwould be freely elected, and the Senate and theSejm together would elect a president. Solidarity
swept the board in the elections held in June
1989: of the 161 seats in the lower chamber that
they were able to contest, they and their nomi-nees won 160; in the Senate, they won 92 outof 100 seats. It was a triumph for Wae¸sa. With
their 299 reserved seats, the communist coalition
partners still had a majority in the lower chamber.
When it came to the election of the president,
Jaruzelski made it by one vote, with some helpfrom Wae¸sa, who refused to stand against him
for fear that this would push the communists and
Moscow too far. The compromise was cemented
when, in August 1989, Jaruzelski appointed the
ﬁrst non-communist premier, a Solidarity sup-porter and close associate of Wae¸sa, Tadeusz
Mazowiecki; he, in turn, with an eye on Moscow,
formed a coalition government in which Solidarity
ministers formed the largest group but which allo-
cated the crucial ministries of Defence and theInterior to two communists.Because the leading role of the communistshad been removed by compromise and negotia-
tion in Poland, vestiges of entrenched communist
power, such as the free elections for only a part
of the lower chamber, survived until October1991 when a ‘reserved’ communist majority wasno longer an option after the revolutions else-
where in Eastern Europe during 1989. Poland
was also the ﬁrst communist nation to attempt to
transform itself from a planned to a Western-stylefree-market economy. The new governmentinherited a ruined economy with soaring inﬂation
and falling production. The finance minister,
Leszek Balcerowicz, inaugurated a harsh pro-
gramme to restore the value of the currency, cut
subsidies, deal with a huge foreign debt and makeindustry competitive and productive once more.The shops began to ﬁll with stocks in 1990, but
at prices few could afford. Standards of living fell
more steeply than under the communists. The
Solidarity alliance grew weaker as the ‘commonenemy’ vanished, and Wae¸sa began attacking
Mazowiecki, blaming his government for the
hardships of economic reform because it was not
acting energetically and speedily enough.1THE IRON CURTAIN DISINTEGRATES891
In December 1990, the bewildered Poles cameto elect their new president, Jaruzelski’s term hav-ing been shortened. A hitherto unknown Polish-
Canadian gained more votes than Mazowiecki,
and Lech Wae¸sa won easily. It would be more dif-
ﬁcult to deliver what he had promised. Westernaid was relatively small. Without the Soviet mar-ket, much of Poland’s industry was uncompetitive.
With such poor business prospects, who would
buy shares in privatised industries? Polish shock
therapy did bring down inﬂation and saved the
value of the currency, but living standards fell.The Mazowiecki government in 1990 boldlyset in motion policies to achieve a rapid transition
to a market economy. Privatisation took off with
almost half of all Poland’s employees working for
the private sector by 1992 and nearly all retail busi-
ness in private hands. There remained a large stateindustrial sector that no one wanted to buy. In
1990 Poland suffered from soaring inﬂation of

almost 700 per cent, but in 1991 it fell back to a
more manageable 60 per cent. Even so, price risesfuelled popular discontent because wages did notkeep pace. Unemployment meanwhile exceeded
11 per cent of the workforce and in 1992 was still
rising. The Polish disenchantment with democratic
politicians was clearly in evidence when at the gen-

eral election held in October 1991 less than halfthe Poles bothered to vote at all and those who didreturned twenty different parties to the Sejm with
none receiving more than 12 per cent of the vote.
The unity Solidarity had enjoyed in opposition did
not last long after its victory over communism. Theshock therapy of economic reform, applauded bythe West, which ﬁnally helped to reduce Poland’s
debt burden, turned the Polish people’s enthusi-

asm for post-communist freedom into disillusion-

ment. The transition to capitalism was proving
hard, even though Poland had started early. By1993 the Polish economy at last showed signs ofrecovery with output rising. Nearly half of the
GDP was produced by the private sector. Poland
was even being governed by its ﬁrst woman prime

minister Hanna Suchoka. In the face of politicalinstability Poland made steady progress restructur-
ing its economy. The steep fall in output from
1989 to 1991 began to be reversed in 1992.Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungaryjoined NATO in March 1999 (Yeltsin finallydropped his objections after meeting Clinton inHelsinki the previous March). Clinton offered
some concessions: no nuclear weapons would be
stationed in the countries of new entrants and the
US would cut its forces in Europe by two-thirdsto about 100,000; NATO weapons were alreadybelow the limits of the Treaty on Conventional
Forces in Europe, and no longer posed a threat
to Russia. Though Russia was not invited to join
the alliance, a Russian–NATO partnership council
was established. Just a few years earlier suchdevelopments would have been unimaginable.Nevertheless, despite all attempts to disguise the
fact, NATO remained an insurance against any
future Russian belligerency. NATO has also
evolved a rapid reaction force in order to policeconﬂicts such as the war in Bosnia – providedmember countries are willing to use it.Poland is by far the most important of the central European countries, with a population of
some 39 million. As in other ex-communist coun-tries, politics have taken an unexpected turn. In the September 1993 elections Aleksander
Kwasniewski leader of the Democratic Left
Alliance, the reorganised Polish Communist
United Workers Party, became prime minister in a
coalition with the Polish Peasant Party. Althoughthe ex-communists, in their four years in power,have not shown such enthusiasm for drastic mar-
ket reform as the previous Solidarity coalitions,
they have nevertheless continued to make selective
changes. Another ex-communist, WlodzimierzCimoszewizs, followed as prime minister, but notraces were left of the old communism; the Polish
leaders had become technocrats, following not 
the bankrupt Russian model but the leading light
of Washington. The government sought to
restrict state spending in order to encourage theprivate sector. With an excellent growth rate andincreasing foreign investment, Poland’s economic
performance has been the best in Eastern and cen-
tral Europe, though high inﬂation remained a
problem in 1996. Solidarity had become wary ofthe market reforms: the closing of the Gdan
´sk
shipyard, where the party was born, was a particu-
larly bitter blow. A disparate opposition was
welded together by a Solidarity leader, Marian892GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
Krzaklewski, into the Solidarity Electoral Action(AWS) and emerged from the elections ofSeptember 1997 as the single biggest party, with
33.8 per cent of the vote. The ruling Democratic
Left Alliance also increased their support to 27.1
per cent of the vote but the coalition partners, thePeasant Party, which had gained little from marketreform, lost heavily. The new AWS, which in-
cluded elements of the anti-communist right and
the religious party, formed an uneasy coalition
with the Freedom Union, which is both secular
and keenly free-market. Krzaklewski and the com-promise prime minister of the coalition will ﬁnd ithard to keep a government composed of so many
diverse elements on a reformist track.In the mid-1990s Poland had forged ahead,earning the title of central European tiger. Thepace markedly slowed as the century drew to aclose exposing more starkly the problems Poland
was still confronting, a health service badly
strained, the need for better schools and the infra-
structure of roads and railways. With the worldeconomy in slow growth and especially theGermans in the doldrums, the new millennium
has been a grimmer time, foreign investment
trailed off. What has been remarkable about Polish
politics is their broad consensus. The main parties
are rooted in Poland’s communist past, the AWSand Freedom Union grew out of Solidarity andDemocratic Left Alliance out of the communist
Polish United Workers Party. Both adopted prag-
matic policies differing mainly in emphasis –
agreed on democracy, a pro-Western alignment,desiring US involvement in Europe and supportfor Poland, in favour of joining the European
Union, a market economy, though Democratic
Left Alliance aims at a more gradual pace less
harsh in its effect on the people. Since joining the
European Union on 1 May 2004 Poland’s econ-omy, after three years of little progress, sharplyincreased. Farm subsidies and higher agricultural
prices were a stimulus but prices for consumers
also increased and unemployment remained a
problem. On the political scene the reeling social-ist party split, Leszek Miller resigned and MarekBelka in May became prime minister heading a
minority government which struggles on in the
absence of a stable coalition.Kádár’s regime in Hungary had since the late1960s placed economic reforms, rising living stan-
dards, more choice and greater freedoms in the
forefront of its policies. The softer image of 
the Communist Party, whose leading role could
not be challenged, reconciled the majority of thepeople to the limited options it permitted. Kádárprojected himself as the leader who knew how far
he could go without risking a repeat of the Soviet
invasion of 1956. The 1968 New Economic
Mechanism, as the mixture of central planning and
market-oriented policies was called, seemed towork for a while. Four years later, there was somebacktracking to a planned economy. Goulash
communism was kept going by increasingly heavy
foreign credits – and so debts. By the mid-1980s,
Hungary’s economy was showing every sign ofsickness. Kádár’s reforms were too cautious.Communist Party dominance of economic plan-

ning blocked any genuine market-oriented course.
Kádár at heart was a communist who wanted to
make communism work, not a pragmatic marketeconomist or a believer in democracy. Even so,communist power dragged on.In May 1988, the party itself got rid of Kádár,and the reformist communist prime minister
Károly Grósz replaced him. Grósz banked on a
more efﬁcient authoritarian communist system topull Hungary out of its economic stagnation. But,for an opposition within the party led by Imre
Pozsgay, this did not constitute any real break
with Kádárism. Pozsgay raised the ghost of Imre
Nagy, who, he declared, had not led a counter-revolution but had put himself at the head of anational uprising. The issue involved a repudiation
of Kádár’s claim to legitimacy and to the party’s
claim that Nagy had been wrong to espouse a
multi-party political system. In June 1988, the
remains of Nagy were reinterred with honour.Henceforth the Communist Party was deeplydivided between reformers and conservatives.The opposition parties were equally split bet-
ween the liberal, urban and intellectually led Alli-

ance of Free Democrats and the populist Hungar-ian Democratic Forum, which claimed to defendthe ordinary man and the small farmers and peas-

ants of the countryside. As in Poland, where anti-
intellectual and anti-Semitic sentiments during the1THE IRON CURTAIN DISINTEGRATES893
presidential election were used to discreditMazowiecki (he was ‘smeared’ as being of Jewishdescent, though he was not), so the Democratic
Forum denigrated the Alliance of Free Democrats
for its supposedly intellectual ‘Jewish’ inﬂuences

(anti-Semitism has remained a ﬂourishing evil in
Eastern Europe). When the free elections wereheld in March 1990, the communists – now calling
themselves the Hungarian Socialist Party – suffered
a humiliating defeat, which also sealed the fate of
Pozsgay. Thus in Hungary as in Poland, there was
a peaceful end to communist rule and a transfer toa Democratic Forum government in May. Theprime minister, Forum’s leader Jozsef Antall,
stressed that he would follow a gradual route to a
market economy. But Hungarian nationalism was
reviving, which threatened to isolate Hungary andexacerbate the problems with its neighbours,Slovakia with 600,000 ethnic Hungarians, Serbia
with 150,000 and Romania with 1.8 million. In
1993 moderation prevailed and neo-fascist appeals
for Lebensraumwere being rejected; prosperitycame before conﬂict.
Hungary also experienced difﬁcult years in themid-1990s. Inflation and unemployment were
high, relations with Slovakia strained after sug-
gestions from the Slovak leader, Vladimír Mecˇiar,that the Hungarians in his country should beforced to return to Hungary and the Slovakiansin Hungary repatriated to their homeland. With
other neighbours, however, good relations have
been established and Hungary has avoided
involvement in the destructive ethnic disputes inthe Balkans. Hungary has the most consistentlystrong economy in Eastern Europe. Its accession
to the European Union on 1 May 2004 will
strengthen it further. Politically Hungary has
become a stable democracy with the electorate
polarised between the two major parties. Thesocialist MSzP won the 1994 election and VictorOrbán, more nationalist Fidesz Civic Party won
the election in 1998 only to lose to the socialists
in 2002. Undermined by scandals, Fidesz looks
to win the elections of 2006. The major partieseach head coalitions. As a member of NATO(2003) and the EU, Hungary takes pride in a
strong sense of national identity and opposes the
federalist trends of the Union. The Czech and Slovak peoples had to acquiescein Husák’s rule after 1968, with the Red Armytroops stationed in Czechoslovakia ready to back
it. Stability brought a measure of economic
improvement in the 1970s and for a time rising
standards of living, but by the 1980s the Czecheconomy was in deep crisis. As was the casethroughout Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia was
relying on increasingly outdated factories and
methods of production. Once, in previous years,
Czechoslovakia had been a model of economic
progress in Eastern Europe, comparable toWestern countries; now it had been turned intoa characteristic Soviet-bloc economy – stagnant,
with an over-emphasis on heavy industry, and so
unmindful of the environment that industry was
creating in parts of the country an ecological dis-aster, rendering the air so polluted that it madethe population sick.But Czechoslovakia had one positive aspect incommon with its heavy-handed Soviet mentor: an
immensely lively and distinguished group of dis-sident writers and intellectuals. Their courageousspokesman was a playwright, Václav Havel. The
Helsinki Agreements, promising human rights,
provided the dissidents with a unifying pro-

gramme with which to attack the communist
regime. In January 1977 they formed the Charter77 movement, whose manifesto demanded re-spect for human rights. Its leaders, who met
informally in each other’s houses, were arrested,
harassed and imprisoned for anti-state activities.
But their protests reached a wide audience in theWest and kept the spark of resistance alive inCzechoslovakia.As the 1980s drew to a close, Husák could notisolate Czechoslovakia from the stirrings of
freedom in Poland and Hungary or from the
reformist impact of Gorbachev’s ‘new thinking’.The old reactionary communist stance had had itsday. But Husák did not give up. He resigned
from the leadership of the party in December
1987 only to hand it to another hardline com-
munist, Milos Jakesˇ, while he himself retained thepresidency. In 1988 and during the early monthsof 1989, Czechoslovakia seemed still to be ﬁrmly
in the communist grip, out of tune with all the
other East European states except Romania which894GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
remained obedient to Ceausˇescu’s dictatorship.But the Czech communist leadership felt ill atease and began to make a number of concessions.Thereafter the collapse of communist rule wasboth sudden and unexpected. On 17 November
1989 there was a large student demonstration inPrague joined by thousands of people. The bru-tality of the police attempts to suppress it, which
caused many injuries, provoked increasingly large
mass protests. Meanwhile, under Havel’s leader-
ship, opposition groups, with Charter 77 mem-
bers at their core, began to organise themselvesas the Civic Forum opposition. Their aim was the overthrow of the communist regime. An 
emotional open-air meeting was addressed by
Alexander Dubcˇek in Prague. In the end theworkers’ decision to join a national strike broughtdown the government. Jakesˇresigned with his
ministers. The Velvet Revolution was completed
without violence only a month later when Havel
on 29 December 1989 was elected president.
High on the agenda for Havel and the govern-ment elected in June 1990 was how to dealhumanely with the problems of creating an efﬁ-
cient market economy, and with the nationality
problem that had beset the state from its birth,
the relationship between Slovaks and Czechs. The
Czech Republic should have found it easier toshrug off communism and embrace a marketeconomy: unlike its neighbours it had enjoyed
democratic rule before the Second World War.
The Czechs had also the capacity for innovative
industrial skills. However, the rapid privatisationprogramme, which sought to bring about a widedistribution of shares in state industries, ran into
difﬁculties here just as it did elsewhere in ex-
communist Europe. The shares were bought up
by investment trusts which in turn were run by
the banks, many of them state owned. This meantthat the liberalised economy lacked many of thedisciplines and beneﬁts of the market. Despite a
ﬁnancial crisis, the ruling coalition of conservative
Prime Minister Václav Klaus struggled on until he
was ousted in November 1997; the economyresumed its slow rate of growth.Slovakia was particularly hard hit since most ofthe heavy industry was located there. Separate
reformist parties, the Civic Forum and the SlovakPublic Against Violence, gained a clear majorityin the multi-party federal election held in June1990. The Communist Party survived with a 
large decline in support. The dominant issue in
1991 became whether the country would split.
Slovakia, which had most to fear from a rapidmove to a market economy, turned to a newleader Vladimír Mecˇiar, who founded a national-ist party. By the close of 1992, a bloodless separ-
ation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia had
been agreed.Slovakia’s ﬂawed democracy was treated withsuspicion by the West. From 1993 to 1998 pop-
ulist Prime Minister Mecˇiar had dominated Slovak politics as leader of the Movement for
Democratic Slovakia. An opposition began to 
coalesce, the Slovak Democratic Coalition, andousted Mecˇiar after the September 1998 election. During the next four years the Western-orientated 
conservative–centre coalition, pro free market and
democratic, made it its aim to join NATO and the
European Union. The economy began to improve,but the strength of Mec
ˇiar opposition – his partywas still the strongest single party in parliament –
held out the prospect that he would return to
power. His weakness was that no other party
would join him in a coalition. His star was fading.
The candidate put up by the Slovak DemocraticCoalition, Robert Schuster, beat Mecˇiar in thepresidential election in 1999.Romania’s revolution of 1989 was both thebloodiest and the most enigmatic in its outcome.Two communist leaders dominated Romania’spost-war history, Gheorge Gheorghiu-Dej from
1945 to his death in 1965, and his successor
Nicolae Ceaus¸escu from 1965 until his ignomin-
ious end, shot with his wife beside him against a
wall. The savagery of the Romanian revolutionwas a reaction to the harshly repressive rule of his closing years. Both Gheorghiu-Dej and
Ceaus¸escu were driven by a ruthless nationalism
to make Romania independent of the Soviet
Union, and to make it strong. They followed theclassic Stalinist route of emphasis on the crashdevelopment of heavy industry and, under
Ceaus¸escu, this was done without any regard to
the cost of the people’s standard of living.1THE IRON CURTAIN DISINTEGRATES895
Gheorghiu-Dej succeeded in persuading theKremlin to withdraw the Red Army from Roman-ian soil in 1958, and thereafter his country was a
nominal member of the Warsaw Pact rather than
a loyal, subservient ally. In the Kremlin the
Romanians’ uncomfortable stance was accepted,because there was never any doubt about theircommunist credentials.Ceaus¸escu succeeded Gheorghiu-Dej after his
death in 1965. He eliminated all his political
rivals, courted mass popularity by playing the
anti-Soviet card and during his early years manip-ulated public attitudes by permitting considerablecultural freedom. He also followed an independ-
ent foreign policy, allowing openings to the West.
Admiration for the ‘strong leader’ and fear of
Soviet intervention buttressed his support athome. It also earned him far too uncriticalsupport in the West – knighted in Britain, he was
host to President Nixon in Bucharest in 1969. In
1983, Vice-President George Bush was suffi-
ciently misled to describe him as ‘one of Europe’sgood communists’. The Cold War blinkeredsound judgement.During the 1970s Western credits helped himto pursue his vision of turning Romania into a
modern industrial nation, but in the 1980s his
grandiose economic plans ended in disaster.There was no new investment, as the dictatorsqueezed everything productive for export to
repay the international debts. He was not willing
to be dependent on Western creditors either.
With his wife Elena, Ceaus¸escu in the end lost all
touch with reality and built up a personality cultwithout parallel. His family exploited and pillaged
Romania’s scant resources for their own luxurious
lifestyles. They lived like potentates. Among his
ﬁnal acts of economic madness was his urbanisa-
tion programme, which would have involvedsimply bulldozing half of Romania’s villages andbuilding soulless blocks of ﬂats in their place. A
beginning was made, and at last the West was
shocked.The secret police, the Securitate, made surethat any opposition from the cowed people wasextinguished; in Romania even the Church
leaders made their own peace with the regime.
For Ceaus¸escu the right path to follow during the
years of communism’s crisis at the end of the1980s was that of the Chinese leadership inTiananmen Square, not the Kremlin’s glasnostand perestroika. Until the outbreak of the spon-taneous revolution in December 1989, Romania
appeared to be as securely in the grip of its leaderas Albania. Wishing to stand well with the West,Ceaus¸escu’s solution for the small, brave intellec-
tual opposition was to force them to leave the
country. In the 1980s the Securitate behaved
more ruthlessly against lesser-known critics of the
regime; an unknown number were murdered.A curtain-raiser for the revolution two yearslater was the 1987 revolt by the workers of
Kronstadt. Some 5,000 stormed the party head-

quarters and shouted ‘Down with Ceaus¸escu!’
Their lives had become intolerable. The Securitateput down the rebellion with murderous brutality.Just a few brave individuals continued to protest
and demonstrate. Among them was Pastor Laszlo
Tokes in Timis¸oara, who looked after his Hungar-
ian ethnic ﬂock. Timis¸oara lay in a region in west-
ern Romania that had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire before 1918; since then it
had remained in Romania. The Securitate harassed
the pastor, and his bishop, under state pressure,
ordered his removal to another parish. On 15
December 1989, his congregation, Hungariansand Romanians, surrounded his house to protecthim and his family from deportation. Once again,
as so often in history, this particular dissent, small
and apparently inconsequential, was the spark that
started a revolution. The protest spread to themixed Romanian and Hungarian population ofTimis¸oara. On 17 December 1989, the army
moved in. Bloody clashes ensued, and the unequal
fight soon ended with many dead. The news
spread through Romania and the world. Ceaus
¸escu
was losing control.On 21 December Ceaus¸escu arranged for the
usual adulation to greet him when he addressed
a crowd of 100,000 in Bucharest’s University
Square from the balcony of the Communist Party
Central Committee Building. Well-rehearsedexpressions of approval arose from the front ofthe crowd, but from behind followed catcalls and
shouts of ‘Murderers of Timis¸oara!’ Ceaus
¸escu,
bewildered, was hustled back into the building896GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
and Romanian television interrupted its broad-cast. It was the signal people had been waitingfor: in the afternoon and evening they poured
into the streets. Securitate and army units started
firing indiscriminately at them, killing and
wounding many. Deﬁantly, the crowds gatheredagain in University Square on 22 December andwere ready to storm the Central Committee
Building. They sensed that the army was now
with them and that only isolated fanatics of the
Securitate were still resisting the overthrow of
Ceaus¸escu. That morning the Ceaus
¸escus ﬁnally
ﬂed from the roof of the building by helicopter,a journey that ended with their summary trial and
execution on Christmas Day.A Council of the Front for National Salvationwas formed, and Ion Iliescu, once Ceaus¸escu’s
secretary for ideological issues, was chosen bythem as president. There was no democratic tra-
dition in Romania. The National Salvation Front
was dominated by reformist communists, who
disingenuously denied that they were bringingforth the Communist Party in a new guise. Iliescuwon working-class support with concessions on
wages, and living conditions were rapidly
improved. He wanted to avoid plunging Romania
into hardship by trying to produce a Western-
style market-oriented economy. He also empha-sised Romanian nationalism, especially by meansof the ‘Romanisation’ of Transylvania, whose
population was now evenly divided between
ethnic Hungarians and Romanians. The region
had been part of Hungary until 1918; it was thenhanded to Romania, returned to Hungary byHitler in 1940 and then given back to Romania
by the Allies in 1945 – a football of international
diplomacy, which had shown little concern for the
protection of the minorities involved.In May 1990, Iliescu won an overwhelmingvictory in the presidential elections and theNational Salvation Front was no less triumphant
in the parliamentary elections. In June, claiming
that the Front was in danger, Iliescu let some
20,000 communist miners, who had been trans-ported to Bucharest, loose on the democraticopposition, and they beat up civilians indiscrimi-
nately ‘to restore order’. Violence also marked
dealings with the democratic opposition of theHungarian Democratic Union Party. Beset byethnic hatreds, by discrimination against minori-ties and by the mob’s knee-jerk hostility to for-
eigners, Hungarians and Jews, the political future
of Romania, a country that has never known
democracy, looked bleak. The terrible legacy ofCeaus¸escu’s rule, including the neglected orphans
with AIDS and the shattered economy, remained
a heavy burden. The intimidation of the opposi-
tion during and after the election in May, and the
violence of the miners brought to Bucharest in
June 1990, revealed the true colours of theNational Salvation Front. A rapid drive towards amarket economy was launched by Prime Minister
Petre Roman. The consequences were dire –
falling production and soaring unemployment
and President Iliescu dismissed Roman. In theearly 1990s Romania retained links with its com-munist past; President Iliescu therefore continued
to enjoy support. But there have been economic
reforms, though at a much slower pace than in
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. The fall inoutput continued even in 1992 to about half thelevel of 1989. In these dire conditions the people
fear radical remedies and cling to some of the old-
guard leadership.Romania continued to be ruled by ex-communists who brought the country close tobankruptcy in spite of oil revenues and its richfarming land. They were ousted only in November
1996 with the election of President Emil Constan-
tinescu. Romania then looked to the West and,

munist Party as a kind of feudal boss, ruling thecountry with the assistance of feudal regionalbosses in what was industrially the most backward
of the Eastern European nations, excepting only
Albania. Bulgaria was distinctive too in that it tra-
ditionally looked to Russia as its friend. So there
was none of the nationalist agitation against theSoviet Union common elsewhere in EasternEurope. That hatred was reserved for its Turkish
neighbour, Bulgaria’s bitter foe since the days of
the Ottomans.Zhivkov was as odious a dictator as any, hisrepressive machinery of state claiming thousandsof victims. Prodded by the Kremlin, he proposed
reforms in 1987, but nothing came of them.
Instead, to bolster his popularity, he turned on
the Turkish minority in the summer of 1989.Violent repression of Turkish demonstrations ledto a mass exodus of the Turks from Bulgaria into
Turkey and badly tarnished Zhivkov’s standing
both in the West and in the Kremlin. The demo-
cratic opposition groups had only recently been
formed, so they were too weak to topple him.The job was done by reformist communists fromwithin: in November 1989 Zhivkov, to his aston-
ishment, was dismissed by the Politburo. The
reformers won, and in June 1990, in a free elec-
tion, the communists, now called the BulgarianSocialist Party, gained a substantial victory overthe Western-oriented Union of Democratic
Forces, though achieving only a small overall
majority of eleven in the 400-member parliament.
Anti-Turkish nationalism and fear of the conse-
quences of introducing Western capitalism hadswayed the voters. In August 1990, the urbanopposition in Soﬁa turned to violent demonstra-
tion, but in the circumstances the response of the
ruling communists in the Bulgarian Socialist Party
was moderate. With the direct election as presi-dent of the incumbent Zheliu Zhelev in January1992, it was to be hoped that Bulgaria was enter-
ing a more stable period. Much of the commu-
nist bureaucracy remained in place and economicreform was only halfhearted at best. Not surpris-ingly foreign investment was slow to appear, andinﬂation in 1991 reached 600 per cent, but by
adopting IMF-designed remedies it fell to 80 per
cent in 1992. With Romania, Bulgaria also suf-
fered severely, its output falling to a little over 60per cent of that in 1987.Communist rule lasted the longest where Sovietdomination ceased decades ago. Enver Hoxha,
fervent Stalinist admirer, was fortunate to die in
1985 before the wave of revolution. In Albania,the revolution was delayed. Not until 1991 werestatues of the great leader Enver toppled by angry
students. That there were students at all, a univer-
sity and a high degree of literacy was one of the
few positive results of Hoxha’s forty-year rule. ForAlbania was the most backward and the poorestcountry in Europe. Hoxha, Stalinist and repres-
sive, broke with the post-Stalin Soviet Union in
the 1960s and with the reformist phase of Chinese
communism in the late 1970s. The intensenationalism of his regime and the successful asser-tion of independence from powerful neighbours,
especially Yugoslavia contributed to the popular
support he enjoyed during his years in power. His
successor, Ramiz Alia, was also a convinced com-
munist but was attempting to adjust Albania tothe changing, more liberal climate of EasternEurope. He was also leading it out of self-imposed
isolation. He remained as one of the undiluted
communist survivors of the post-revolutionary
years. The West, although accustomed to viewingpoverty in the Third World, was deeply shockedby the conditions still existing in Albania. Yet
refugees trying to ﬂee in boats to Italy were turned
back. An Italian relief operation codenamed
Pelican launched during the winter of 1991,
alone, saved Albanians from widespread starva-tion. The communists were not ousted until 1992 when Sali Berisla was elected the ﬁrst non-
communist president. For the ordinary Albanian
the prospects in the 1990s remained grim. In
1997 order was once more restored when anItalian peacekeeping force organised elections.Bloodshed, war and ethnic strife in EasternEurope reached heights in what was formerly898GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
Yugoslavia that exceeded anything witnessed else-where, including the Soviet Union. The Westernpowers and the United Nations sought to
mediate, but Serbs, Croats and Muslims – while
endlessly talking and concluding ceaseﬁre agree-
ments – went on bloodily ﬁghting each other.The memory of the bitter struggle between Serbsand those Croats who had supported the fascist
puppet regime in Croatia during the Second
World War was revived. Tito’s legacy of a federal
state held together by the Communist Party dis-
integrated with disastrous effect. But after hisdeath in 1980 even his huge prestige and thepower of the Communist Party apparatus could
not overcome the weakening of the centre. Local
party bosses, cultural differences and gross eco-
nomic discrepancies between comparatively prosperous Slovenia and the poverty of parts ofSerbia hastened the separation of the republics.
Successive constitutions sought to avoid violent
nationality clashes by conceding more power to
the communist leadership and its apparatus ineach republic. Yugoslavia was open to the West.Indeed, tourism became the most important
hard-currency earner with the start of mass airtravel in the 1960s. By the 1980s, the Yugoslaveconomy was in a mess and reached levels ofhyperinflation similar to the worst in Latin
America. In 1990 the federal prime minister’s
currency reform and economic measures restored
ﬁnancial stability but at the cost of hardship andunemployment which exacerbated the conflictbetween the nationalities.The conﬂict had become very evident in 1987when the Communist Party of the most power-
ful republic, Serbia, was taken over by Slobodan
Milos
ˇevic´. He gained momentum and popularityby fanning Serbian national fervour. An issue wasimmediately at hand: the problem presented by
the province of Kosovo, one of the poorest
regions in the whole country, peopled by a major-
ity of Albanians, but with a large Serbian minor-ity. The proportion of Albanians, with their muchhigher birth rate, would increase further in any
case, but this process was hastened by the mass
emigration of Serbians. Without real evidence,
Milos
ˇevic´claimed that this was the result of
Albanian terrorism. Albanian protest againstSerbian repression led to uprisings, demonstra-
tions and bloody conﬂict. More serious still was1THE IRON CURTAIN DISINTEGRATES899

pretensions but had its own designs on the eth-
nically mixed population of the republic of Bosniaand Herzogovina, while the Serbs in Croatia wereprotesting against the discrimination practised
against them. The Slovenes not only wanted 
to rid themselves of all communist control but
also desired virtual independence. Free elec-
tions fatally weakened not only the communists,however much they attempted to distance them-selves from the past by renaming their party, but
also the federal union.By comparison with their Eastern Europeanneighbours, the Germans living in the nowdefunct German Democratic Republic appeared
to be the lucky ones. They were not simply cast
adrift, like those neighbours, cut off from the
Soviet Union, having to struggle to transformtheir countries largely by their own efforts, withrelatively little Western help. The Germans in the
East were united with the most prosperous
country in Europe, their fellow Germans in the
West. Both lots of Germans had greeted with
jubilation the tearing down of the Berlin Wall on9 November 1989.The DDR economy was the most advanced ofall the economies in Eastern Europe. With help
and investment from the Federal Republic it was
expected it would be brought up to Westernstandards after reuniﬁcation. The costs of all this,no doubt high temporarily, could be met by
increased state borrowing and then repaid from
the growth of the German economy as a whole.
Just as the Federal Republic was reaching an eco-
nomic plateau, here was the chance of anotherWirtschaftswunder, a happy combination of amoral victory and an economic opportunity. But
it all went sour as quickly as the unexpected uni-
ﬁcation of Germany had been accomplished.As 1989 began no one in Europe or the restof the world anticipated a cataclysmic change.Erich Honecker, the DDR head of state, lauded
the ‘scarcely conceivable’ achievements of the
‘ﬁrst socialist state of workers and peasants onGerman soil’. The dour and dedicated commu-nist Walter Ulbricht was forced in May 1971 to step down as party secretary, probably on
Moscow’s instructions, and was replaced by Erich
Honecker. It was Ulbricht who had ordered the
Berlin Wall to be built in August 1961 to stemthe haemorrhage of the ‘workers’ and ‘peasants’crossing to freedom and a better life in the West.
He had also ruthlessly built up East German man-
ufacturing in heavy industry and chemicals,
regardless of the ecological cost. The attempt to
make the DDR an industrial and independentcommunist showpiece fell apart under Honeckerin the 1970s and 1980s, despite the advantages
of a privileged relationship with the European
Community: trade between the two Germanies
counted as internal EEC trade, a concession tothe Federal Republic which offered automaticWest German citizenship to any DDR citizen who
wanted it and could get to the West.It is quite possible that Honecker actuallybelieved all the false statistics put out by his gov-
ernment showing how well things were going.They were certainly going well enough for him and
the communist elite, living in the lap of luxury and
owning extravagantly appointed holiday villas on
land on which ordinary mortals were not allowed
to set foot. Control over the people was exercisedby the Stasi, the 85,000-strong security police whorelied on denunciations to alert them to dissident
comrades. As in National Socialist Germany, there
was no shortage of friends and neighbours, teach-

ers and managers, who were ready to spy and toreport wrong attitudes to the state authorities. Thebulging ﬁles of the Stasi are now among the most
embarrassing legacies of the DDR.During the spring and summer of 1989,Honecker resisted all pressures for reform, despite
the radical changes taking place among two of theDDR’s neighbours, Poland and Hungary. In theKremlin, too, Gorbachev had shown that there
was no alternative to reform, to respect for human
rights and to the removal of the corrupt and stul-
tifying party apparatchiks. The DDR Politburodid not welcome this, but the hardline comradescould take heart from the ﬁrmness the Czech

leadership was showing. And if demonstrations
looked like getting out of hand, the Chinese900GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
showed that summer how best to deal with them.Honecker even despatched his protégé, EgonKrenz, to Beijing to congratulate the Chinese
leadership on its bloody handling of the students
in Tiananmen Square. Bankrupt Albania was
another stout ally. Honecker, by now totally outof touch, was looking forward to celebrating thefortieth anniversary of the founding of the DDR.So far the West Germans had done little toencourage ideas of fundamental change in the
relationship between the two Germanies. Chan-
cellor Kohl, whose popularity had fallen very low,seemed clumsy and out of depth. Within his coali-tion government there were tensions with the
Free Democratic Party and with the astute foreign
minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who since 1987
had advocated a more ﬂexible policy towards theSoviet Union. The moments of pivotal change inthe triangular relationship of East and West
Germany and the USSR can be dated with some
precision. The Achilles heel of the Soviet Union’s
dominance was its own collapsing economy.Gorbachev badly needed Western help, especiallyWest German help. When he arrived in Bonn to
a rapturous welcome from the crowds in June
1989, he really came as a supplicant for economic
assistance. The price was freedom for the Germans
in the DDR. Gorbachev and Kohl signed anaccord pledging them to work to end the divi-sion of Europe, to respect human rights and to
expand economic and cultural cooperation.
Gorbachev’s spokesman, Gennadi Gerasimov
quipped that, for the people of the DDR, ‘therewas the Brezhnev Doctrine. Now we have theFrank Sinatra Doctrine – let them do it their way.’
They very soon did.The East German regime had to watch withbewilderment the ﬂood of DDR ‘tourists’ who
travelled to neighbouring Hungary, Czecho-
slovakia and Poland and then camped there in theWest German embassies waiting to leave for the
West. A trickle turned into a ﬂood. During August

and September 1989 tens of thousands left and the
Hungarians opened the border to Austria. TheHungarians, heavily in debt to the West, weremore anxious to please prosperous West Germany
than the bankrupt East. On 7 October, the
anniversary celebrations were held in East Berlin.Gorbachev planted a Judas kiss on 77-year-oldHonecker’s cheek. It was the last occasion whenregimented loyalists waved their ﬂags and cheered

their leader. In the backstreets, riot police were 
trying to keep the protesters in check. Soon,
Honecker was urging that the police and armyshould open ﬁre on the demonstrators who weregathering in East Germany’s principal cities – 
East Berlin, Dresden and above all in Leipzig. This
decided leading communists in the Politburo to
organise a coup, with the Kremlin’s secret
approval. On 18 October 1989, Egon Krenz top-
pled and replaced an astonished Honecker. But,with his wolﬁsh look and smile, Krenz could not
quell the spirit of revolt. On 9 November 1989 he
ordered that the Berlin Wall should be opened.The Protestant Church in East Germany hadplayed an honourable and courageous role informing an opposition grouping. It called itself
New Forum, a coalition of clergymen, artists,
socialists and ordinary men and women who
wanted to bring to an end the repression. Soon,hundreds of thousands, many among themformer communists, took to the streets to
demonstrate. The call for the gang of communist
leaders to go was almost universal. Hundreds of
thousands wanted to live and move in freedom,
to change their drab lives. The El Dorado of theWest beckoned. Meanwhile, Chancellor Kohl wasbecoming alarmed. The East Germans ﬂooding to
West Germany, which was trying to cope with its
own unemployment and housing problems, were,
on second thoughts, not all that welcome. Wouldit not be better after all if they stayed in their ownreformed eastern half of Germany?In the DDR economic collapse and mountingpopular protest were wresting control from the
communist leadership. Scandals and corruption
were revealed. A reformist communist, HansModrow, replaced Krenz early in December1989. His hold on power was brief and tenuous.
The West Germans were, in a sense, also in
danger of losing control. Their fear was that they
would be swamped with Germans from the East.Kohl, who had hesitated until the close of 1989,had little alternative in 1990 but to ride the tiger.
Once he came to this conclusion he campaigned
with increasing gusto. First, in late November1THE IRON CURTAIN DISINTEGRATES901
1989, he put forward a plan for a ‘confederation’of the two Germanies. This was not well receivedin Moscow, nor was it much welcomed by Mrs
Thatcher’s government. The former Second
World War Allies would in any case have the last
word. Thatcher and Mitterrand advised a cautiousapproach; Bush, with better judgement, gave hisfull backing to Kohl.The German people in the end decided thepace. Once free elections in East Germany had
been conceded, the New Forum, with its objec-
tive of creating a civilised, socialist East Germanstate, and other spontaneous political groups withodd labels were all swept aside. The West German
heavyweight parties moved in, the CDU, the FDP
and the SPD. East German party clones of the
Western parties campaigned for control. Kohl andGenscher, Brandt and SPD politicians were rap-turously received in the East.The complete uniﬁcation of Germany provedunstoppable and happened much faster than
anyone expected. Kohl carried all before him ona barn-storming six-city election tour in March1990, promising currency union and a one-for-
one exchange of East German into West German
marks. The election on 18 March 1990 gave a
landslide victory to the East German CDU, and
its chairman, Lothar de Maizière became the newEast German prime minister. On 1 July, the cur-rency union was carried through as promised,
with the one-to-one exchange for savings up to
4,000 marks.Maizière was still hoping for a gradual processof uniﬁcation, but the majority of East Germanswanted no delay. Meanwhile, in July, at a meeting
between Kohl and Gorbachev, agreement was
quickly reached. Gorbachev dropped his objec-
tion to united Germany remaining a member of
NATO; in return Kohl agreed to cut Germantroops from 590,000 to 370,000 and renouncednuclear, chemical and biological weapons.Gorbachev agreed to pull the Russian troops out
of East Germany by 1994, and Kohl promised to
pay for their rehousing in the Soviet Union. With
the Soviet Union and the US now consenting tounion, the other two treaty powers, France andBritain, could no longer delay their formal
consent. In the meantime the bankruptcy of the
East German state forced Maizière to give up
negotiating for a gradual unification. On 23
August 1990 the Volkskammer voted to dissolvethe state and for East Germany to become partof the Federal Republic. Such a suicide was
unique in the history of international politics –
but then the patient was terminally ill.At midnight, 3 October 1990, to the mutedtones of ‘Deutschland, Deutschland Über Alles’and beneath a sky lit up by ﬁreworks, the most

momentous change in the transformation of
Eastern Europe was consummated. By now, no
one in West Germany any longer believed that uni-
ﬁcation would be an easy or cheap or painlessprocess. Still, Kohl had become the ﬁrst post-war

chancellor of all Germany, and he reaped the
reward for his skilful leadership, so ably supported
by Genscher, when in the December 1990 all-
German election the SPD was soundly beaten andthe CDU/CSU and its partner the FDP emergedwith a substantially increased majority. Kohl had
promised his country’s neighbours that Germany
would be a good European, democratic and peace-

ful. His sincerity on that point, reﬂecting the views
of the vast majority of the German people, was notin doubt. Germany in any case had enough trouble
of its own to discourage even the thought of
adventurism. Here ended the history of a separate
East German state. The history of the old DDR
henceforth was part of Germany’s development.902GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
In the West, the 1980s was a decade of economicproblems apparently overcome and one of rising
prosperity during the good years. Tensions less-
ened between the East and West; the Cold Warcame to an end. In the unstable Middle East the1980s began a new decade of wars, with huge
casualties in the Gulf. The wider world wants
peace in the region.The West cannot accept that any one nation,rabidly hostile to the West, should be able todominate the whole of the Middle East by forceof arms. From the Western economic point of
view the region means oil, and oil is the lifeblood
of contemporary economic life. Yet this oil lies 
in less developed countries, ruled feudally, as inSaudi Arabia and the various sheikhdoms of theGulf, or dictatorially, as formerly in Iraq and Iran.
The masses can be aroused by nationalism in
inter-Arab conﬂicts, by hatred for the ‘imperial-
ist’ West, which in the recent past had practically
colonised the region, by the arousal of anti-Western Islamic fundamentalism, and by what isregarded as the Western imperialist Zionist
outpost, Israel. Yet the bloodiest war of the
century in the Middle East was fought for eight
years by two Muslim Middle Eastern oil nations,Iran and Iraq, one of them Persian, the otherArab. When the decade came to its end, the Arab
nations were still pitted against each other:
Baathist socialist Iraq, violently nationalist and
ruled by Saddam Hussein, was confronted byBaathist socialist Syria, dominated by Hafez Assadand the military; secular Egypt’s relations with thefeudal and rich Saudi Arabia and the sheikhdoms
of the Gulf were hostile. Yet in different degrees
the Arab nations together faced Israel in enmity.The factions of the Palestinian Liberation Organ-isation and the Palestinian rising on the occupied
West Bank and Gaza added further destabilis-
ing elements. In addition, for the greater part of 
the 1980s West and East still sought to establish
regions of inﬂuence, a Cold War policy calcula-tion that did not make for peace.Into this cauldron of instability the West andthe Soviet Union poured in the latest weapons of
war. The West supplied these nations with arms
to secure some leverage over the policies ofMiddle Eastern nations and to protect SaudiArabia and the Gulf sheikhdoms from their more
powerful neighbours, Iran and Iraq. The Soviet
Union also massively armed Iraq and Syria. To
deny arms, the West concluded, would only leave
the way open to Soviet supply and influence.Thus the Cold War was partly responsible for thefuelling of deadly conﬂicts. Not only ‘legitimate’
weapons were sent; ‘merchants of death’ in West
Germany and other countries have secretly helped
to set up poison-gas factories and the technologyfor the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Weaponscame from as far away as Brazil, and were used in
Middle Eastern wars to terrible effect. For the
majority of abject poor living and struggling in
this part of the world the wars further set backany hopes of improvement.1Chapter 77CONTINUING TURMOIL AND WAR IN THE
MIDDLE EASTTerrorism is also closely linked to the conﬂicts
of the Middle East. It is a phenomenon that is notamenable to diplomacy and reason; it is difﬁcult to

control; a few ruthless men and women can com-

mit spectacular acts of carnage and so capture the
world headlines. In this way, the numerically weakdraw attention to their causes in the expectation ofexercising inﬂuence out of proportion to the sup-

port they enjoy. Television carries these crimes
graphically into millions of homes the world over.
Terrorism is not conﬁned to the Middle East and

loose connections were forged between variousterrorist groups – German, Japanese, Irish andArab. A Czech factory supplied the most widely
used plastic explosive, Semtex. Colonel Gaddaﬁof

Libya and President Assad of Syria, among others,
provided funds and armaments to a number of ter-
rorist organisations ﬁghting for what they regarded
as just causes. As a result, terrorism greatly
increased from the end of the 1960s. Among the
most continuous perpetrators were various Arab
groups hostile to Israel and the US, but also toeach other. Car bombs in the Lebanon’s capital,Beirut, caused indiscriminate slaughter, planes
were hijacked, martyrs blew themselves up to kill
their enemies. The list of terrorist acts is too long
to be detailed here. Among the most horrifying
was the murder of the Israeli athletes at theMunich Olympics in September 1972. But some-
times the intended victims could be rescued.In June 1976 the Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine hijacked an Air France
plane with eighty-three Israelis on board; its ﬁnallanding place was Entebbe in Uganda, where theIsraelis were held as hostages. This set the scene
for one of the most dramatic and daring rescue
operations. Idi Amin, the crazed dictator of
Uganda, appointed himself a mediator – the
release of terrorists in the prisons of Israel andother countries was demanded by the hijackers.Instead, Israeli paratroopers landed and, camou-
ﬂaging their arrival at the airport in a ﬂeet of cars
as might be used by Amin and his entourage,
broke undetected into the airport building, killedthe captors and rescued all but three of thehostages, with the loss of one Israeli ofﬁcer and
an elderly Israeli woman (formerly a hostage)
murdered in a Ugandan hospital.Against suicide attacks defence is difﬁcult. Inthe Lebanon, sixty-three Americans were killed inApril 1983 by a fanatical Shia Muslim driving a car
full of explosives into the American Embassy in
Beirut; a few months later, in October, another
suicide bomber killed 241 US marines at theirbase close to Beirut airport. An especial horror inDecember 1988 was the explosion over Scotland
of a Pan American jumbo en route from London
to New York, causing the deaths of all its crew and
passengers. But Western lives lost were but a tiny
fraction of the number of people killed almostdaily in the Middle East. The Lebanon was in vir-tual anarchy, from the mid-1970s to 1991, with
civilians caught up in the inﬁghting of murderous
factions, though in 1992 the kidnapping of for-
eign hostages ended. Western responses were lim-ited and largely ineffective. The organisers ofterror, the men behind the scenes, established
their shifting headquarters in Baghdad, Teheran,
Damascus and Tripoli, their various factions no
more than pawns in Arab struggles for predomin-ance. Only the Arab leaders themselves could con-trol them, and their hold was not absolute.No country in the Middle East has sufferedmore from brutal civil conﬂicts than the Lebanon.
The Christian Lebanese merchants and bankers
did not long enjoy the prosperity the oil-richMiddle East brought them in the 1960s and1970s. A power-sharing agreement, known as the
National Pact and in operation since the Second
World War, guaranteed the presidency to a
Maronite Christian, but it fell apart under thepressure of Muslim–Christian and left–right rival-ries, resulting in civil war in 1958. Though ﬁght-
ing ceased for a time, the central Lebanese
government was unable to overcome the prob-
lems presented by the class conﬂicts, the family
loyalties and the various militias of Muslim andChristian groups. In 1967, the Lebanon’s pre-dicament was further aggravated by the arrival 
of uninvited Palestinian refugees following the
Arab–Israeli War. Arab enmity towards Israel
deepened the gulf between what had become aMuslim majority, which included the poorer partof the Lebanese population, and the wealthier
Maronite Christians. ‘National’ for the Muslims
now meant pro-Arab; for the Christians (except904GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
the Greek Orthodox), ‘national’ meant perpetua-tion of Christian and right-wing predominance inan independent pro-Western Lebanon.In 1970 the Palestinian militants failed in theirattempt to achieve domination over Jordan. Yasser
Arafat and the Palestinian Liberation Organisationwere forced out and with their militant followersmoved into the hapless Lebanon, where they pro-
ceeded to build up their last territorial stronghold
in the areas controlled by the refugees. The term
‘refugee camps’ applied to these strongholds, is
really a misnomer, for the Palestinians created astate within a state. From the Lebanon Palestiniancommandos raided Israel, attacking settlements
and provoking Israeli counter-strikes against
Palestinian targets in the Lebanon.In 1975 civil war was renewed. The Muslimgroups forged an alliance with the Palestinians,the army split and the central government lost
control over the country. It could regain it only
with outside help. The Lebanon was now divided
into warring factions; Christian family clansfought each other for supreme power even as theybattled with the Muslim–Palestinian–left alliance.
The Israelis sent arms to the Maronite Christians,
and the Syrians, responding to pleas for help from
the Christian-dominated central Lebanese gov-

ernment, intervened militarily in 1976, driving theMuslim–Palestinian forces back. Yasser Arafat’sindependent PLO was as little loved in Syria as it
was in Jordan. In 1978, to stamp out Palestinian
commando raids, the Israelis occupied the south-
ern Lebanon, and before withdrawing installed a‘friendly’ Maronite Christian militia under MajorSaad Haddad to keep order and prevent further
PLO attacks. The Lebanon had long since ceased
to be a unitary state and was becoming a quagmire
of internecine factions, none of which was sufﬁ-
ciently powerful to control more than a particulararea, each with its own stronghold. As if theseinternal rivalries were not enough, Syrian–Israeli
hostility, the Palestinian–Maronite Christian con-
ﬂict and, after the outbreak of the Gulf War in
1980, pro-Iraqi and pro-Iranian Muslim rivalryaccelerated the disintegration and destruction ofthe Lebanon.For the Israelis, the continued presence of thePLO in the Lebanon, not to mention the Syrians,represented a serious threat. So the civil strifeoffered opportunities, but it led them into the ill-fated invasion of the Lebanon in 1982, which was
intended to settle once and for all the Palestinian
question and to prove that continued Arab enmity
towards Israel was unrealistic in view of its militarysuperiority. The militant PLO would be drivenfrom their last land base in a neighbouring coun-

try. Israeli prospects seemed favourable, because
Syria and the Palestinians were practically isolated
and their forces much inferior. Israel had already,
by concluding peace with Egypt, secured its south-
ern border against the only strong army that mighthave threatened it. Its ﬁrst war of aggression was

the consequence of a fundamental change in inter-

nal politics during the previous ﬁve years.
In Israeli politics a major turning point occurred in1977 with the victory of the right-wing Likud
Party over the broad labour grouping led by the
Labour Party (Mapai). Labour’s support had suf-

fered after the heavy casualties of the Yom KippurWar in 1973, which had found Israel inadequatelyprepared and had placed the country for a time in
real danger. Golda Meir fell from ofﬁce and was

succeeded by Yitzhak Rabin, who had been chief
of staff in the Six-Day War of 1967. During
Rabin’s premiership, the US made great efforts tomediate a peace between Israel and its neighbours.This introduced the diplomatic world to the new
concept of ‘shuttle diplomacy’, as the American
secretary of state Henry Kissinger carried out
negotiations, tirelessly ﬂying between Damascus,
Cairo and Jerusalem. Kissinger succeeded at leastpartially – disengagement agreements were con-

cluded between Israel, Syria and Egypt. What
blocked a more comprehensive settlement was the
requirement of the Arab states that Israel should
withdraw from the territories it had conquered in1967 – the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and EastJerusalem. This raised the possibility of a hostile
Palestinian presence or even state as Israel’s new
neighbour. Israeli militants were already creating
their own settlements, and there was broad sup-
port from large sections of the electorate that theWest Bank, biblical Judaea and Samaria, must
remain a part of an enlarged Israel. With
Arab–Israeli talks deadlocked, only Nasser’s suc-
1CONTINUING TURMOIL AND THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST905
cessor, President Anwar Sadat, was ready to movefurther, in order to regain the Sinai, lost in 1967.During1977, an election year, Labour’s chances
were harmed by government scandals and by the
damage inﬂicted on the economy by the high cost
of war and armaments. The oriental Jews in partic-
ular regarded the Labour ministers as too ready tocompromise with Israel’s Arab neighbours. All this
contributed to the sea change in Israeli politics.The May 1977 elections brought MenachemBegin and Likud to power at the head of a coali-
tion, breaking three decades of uninterruptedLabour predominance. Begin, at sixty-four yearsof age, was no longer the terrorist he had been
during Israel’s struggle for independence, but he
was convinced that only armed strength, self-
reliance and rock-like ﬁrmness of purpose wouldsecure Israel’s future. On the question of theWest Bank and some possible accommodation
with the PLO, he was unyielding: for him the
right of the Jewish people to ‘Judaea and Samaria’
was not negotiable; for him this was not ‘occu-pied’ but ‘liberated’ territory, and so was EastJerusalem, which had been captured from Jordan
in 1967. Nor did Begin in 1977 give any indica-
tion that he contemplated handing back occupied
Sinai in return for peace with Egypt. Yet that was
to become the crowning achievement of his ﬁrstadministration. Perhaps only an Israeli prime min-ister with Begin’s uncompromising reputation
could have won virtually wholehearted Israeli
support for relinquishing the Sinai.At home, free-enterprise policies soon led thecountry into economic crisis. Given the realitiesof Israeli expenditure and the huge foreign
indebtedness, Likud eventually had to return to
the mixed economic policies of previous govern-
ments. Even so, for his supporters – the poor ori-
ental Jews – Begin provided help in housing, andassisted the renewal of poor neighbourhoods bytwinning them with Jewish communities abroad;
extending free education was a further important
social reform.Abroad the Begin government responded toSadat’s search for peace, with US mediation play-ing a crucial role. Sadat wanted to modernise
Egypt, raise the standard of living of its rapidly
expanding population. He turned to Westerninvestment and away from a state-directed econ-omy. Success depended above all on securing alasting peace with Israel. The crossing by the
Egyptian army of the Suez Canal in the 1973 war
had removed one major obstacle to peace –
Egypt’s self-image, pride and self-conﬁdence hadbeen restored; Israel had not won all the battles.The illusion of military prowess in war was enough
to turn Sadat into a hero in Egyptian eyes, as
Nasser had become a hero after Suez. Sadat cut all
links with the Soviet Union and took to relying on
US support and US inﬂuence in Israel. In 1975 heopened the Suez Canal to shipping again, andallowed cargoes to Israel, though not Israeli ships,
to pass through. In 1977 it was because four men
occupied crucial positions in their countries that a
peace settlement was possible.In Washington Jimmy Carter entered the WhiteHouse, like his predecessors, anxious to facilitate a
settlement in the Middle East. Begin’s priorities
were to secure ‘Judaea and Samaria’, and to defeat
the PLO. Peace with Egypt, even at the price ofreturning most of the occupied Sinai, would iso-late Israel’s enemies and make its position militar-

ily unchallengeable. It was thus a price worth 
paying, provided the existing Israeli settlements
and airbases were retained. General Moshe Dayan,
Begin’s new foreign minister, entirely shared thisview. Security for the West Bank was worth the lossof most of the Sinai. Sadat was also eager for peace:
the cost of continued hostility was simply too high
for the sake of Arab solidarity or the Palestinian
cause. In 1977 he expelled the PLO from Cairo.Nicolae Ceaus¸escu, president of Romania, later to
be discredited for his brutal suppressions at home,
was an unlikely mediator, having preserved good
relations with Israel. Another channel of com-

munication between Egypt and Israel was opened
through the good ofﬁces of the king of Morocco.
Begin also demonstrated goodwill by warningSadat of a Palestinian assassination plot.That a new era in Israeli–Egyptian relations hadbegun became publicly known in a dramatic way.
Sadat liked springing surprises. On 9 November1977 he announced in Cairo’s parliament that hewas ready in person to go to the Israeli parliament
in Jerusalem, the Knesset, to discuss the issues that
divided Israel from its Arab neighbours. Begin was906GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
amazed, but he recovered quickly and the next dayinvited Sadat to Jerusalem. The Arab world con-demned the visit. It was unprecedented and many
in Israel responded warmly and emotionally. A
score of the Egyptian national anthem had to be
rushed to the Israeli army band drawn up at BenGurion airport to receive the Egyptian presidentand his entourage. As he landed, on 19 November
1977, to a twenty-one gun salute, with Israeli and
Egyptian ﬂags ﬂuttering side by side, it was a
moving spectacle. Sadat had certainly seized the
initiative, catching the world’s imagination aspeacemaker, and millions of people watched hisarrival on television. Sadat spoke to the Knesset on
20 November. Many hard negotiating sessions
would be necessary, for Sadat spoke of peace with
all the Arabs, including the Palestinians, and of atotal Israeli withdrawal from occupied lands.But he also spoke of accepting Israel in friend-ship and peace, words no other Arab leader had
uttered, at least not publicly, since 1947. Begin’s
response was conciliatory in form but uncompro-mising in reality on the issues of the Palestiniansand the continued Israeli possession of the West
Bank and East Jerusalem. Yet direct personal
contact had been made, the long road to Camp
David and peace was at least now open. Begin
offered to return the Sinai apart from existingIsraeli settlements. Although there and then therecould be no talk of formal peace, Sadat and Begin
agreed that only by negotiation and not by war
could divisive issues be resolved. Yet negotiations
between Cairo and Jerusalem dragged on fruit-lessly for almost a year, with Washington tryingin vain to ﬁnd a way of resolving their differences.
The Palestinian issue, the West Bank, the Gaza
Strip and the Israeli settlements were blocking
progress. Carter tried again. Finally, Sadat and
Begin accepted an invitation to his presidentialretreat at Camp David to attempt to break thedeadlock. Sadat had been the more accommo-
dating so far; would Begin also compromise?Sadat, Begin, Carter and their advisers la-boured for thirteen days at Camp David until theagreement was signed on 17 September 1978.Carter’s role was crucial, as he cajoled and pres-
surised Sadat and (especially) Begin in turn. To
have reached agreement at all in the face of theIsraeli leader’s obduracy was a personal triumphfor the president. The two major issues were theSinai, and the West Bank and Gaza. Could Begin
be made to give up the whole of the Sinai, includ-
ing the oil wells the Israelis had developed at great
cost, and to pull back strategic settlements whichhe had repeatedly pledged he would never aban-don? Second, would the Palestinians be allowed to
develop in the occupied territories some form of
self-government short of statehood, with the bulk
of Israelis withdrawing? And would the two issues
be linked, as Sadat was insisting: no peace withEgypt without concrete steps towards a solutionof the Palestinian problem? Begin at ﬁrst refused
to budge, and Sadat threatened to leave. Carter
promised to place the blame for a breakdown on
Begin when he came to report to Congress.Reluctantly, Begin gave way – the whole of theSinai would be handed back in stages. But the
procedures leading to Palestinian autonomy, and
what that really meant, left practically everything
to Israel’s readiness and judgement; in practice,there was no linkage. The various compromiseswere wrapped up in two main agreements and a
number of agreed additional letters and docu-
ments. At a subsequent news conference, which
was televised, Sadat and Begin embraced as a
beaming Carter looked on. Even then the road tothe deﬁnitive peace treaty signed in the WhiteHouse on 26 March 1979 was strewn with obsta-
cles, overcome only by determined American
mediation and ﬁnancial help.In Israel most people approved of the peace –the hawks because it strengthened Israel againstthe other Arab states by leaving it in ﬁrm occu-
pation of the West Bank, and the doves because
it showed that peace could be concluded with an
Arab state, formerly an implacable enemy. But the
Palestinian issue festered. The chance to makegenuine progress was lost. If Israel had actedspeedily to fulﬁl the spirit of the Camp David
Accords, ‘autonomy’ – a genuine degree of self-
determination – might have had a chance. The
Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza werebeneﬁting from a rapid rise in their standard ofliving as a result of their close association with the
Israeli economy – but the military occupation
acted as a constant reminder that their status 1CONTINUING TURMOIL AND THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST907
was not that of a self-respecting free people.Inevitably a younger, better-educated generationof Palestinians was radicalised. The prospect of a
Palestinian–Israeli reconciliation was thrown
away, and the Israelis and Palestinians have been
paying the bitter price ever since.How much better it would have been to havefollowed Sadat’s advice. He secured the return of
the Sinai but was ostracised and condemned by
the rest of the Arab world. US ﬁnancial help and
the resources of the Sinai did not fully compensate
Egypt for the loss of aid from the oil-rich Arabstates. Its economic problems, with a rapidlyincreasing population, prevented a quick improve-
ment in living standards for the mass of the poor.
But no more young Egyptian lives would be lost
in war. Instead, the courageous and far-seeingpresident paid for peace with his own life. At a military parade on 6 October 1981 a small group
of Egyptians recruited by Muslim fundamentalists
assassinated Sadat as he took the salute. The vice-
president, Hosni Mubarak, miraculously survivedthe hail of bullets to become Egypt’s new head ofstate. The peace prevailed, but the sincerity and
warmth of feeling, the desire for genuine reconcil-
iation between Egyptian and Israeli, were interred
with Sadat’s remains.Begin’s ﬁrst government from 1977 to 1981 hadseemed to promise a new peaceful beginning with
the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian peace
treaty. The soldiers in his Cabinet were cautious
men unwilling to be drawn into new confronta-tions. Yasser Arafat’s PLO and Assad’s Syrianregime, too, were aware of their own vulnerabil-
ity and were observing truce agreements. But
inside the Lebanon the factional struggles sucked
in the Syrians in support of the Christian
Maronites, who then also made constant appealsto the Israelis. Meanwhile the PLO was strongenough to dominate the southern Lebanon with
increasing effectiveness. Begin’s ministers contin-
ued to urge caution in dealing with the mess in
the Lebanon; but they were split on whether apreventive air strike against Iraq was advisable,some arguing that there could be no justiﬁcation
in international law for such an attack at a time
of peace. But Begin won out.On 7 June 1981 eight Israeli F-16 jet ﬁghterstook off and, together with an escort of six F-15s,with surgical precision destroyed the Iraqi Osiraq
nuclear reactor. All the Israeli planes returned to
the bases safely. The reactor, built with French
help, was not yet capable of producing atomicbombs, but given time the Iraqis would undoubt-edly have succeeded in acquiring all that was 
necessary to make the weapons. There was inter-
national condemnation of Israel, but at home the
Israelis rallied to Begin, which did his coalition no
harm in the general election that June. Despite theeconomic setbacks, Likud strengthened its posi-tion, but the new coalition Begin led depended
for its tiny majority on the religious parties. His
views had always been hard line on the Palestinian
and West Bank issues. Now instead of being mod-erated by the exigencies of coalition government,they were reinforced by the extremist religious
groups. The most aggressive of the hawks, Ariel
Sharon, the daring military commander who had
turned the tide for Israel in the 1973 Yom KippurWar,became minister of defence.The new govern-
ment’s external policies came to be overshadowed
by Sharon’s ‘grand design’, which turned out 
disastrously for Begin personally and for Israel.On the occupied West Bank new Israeli settle-
ments had sprung up, and more were planned.They clearly indicated Israel’s intention of staying.Sharon wanted to go further – a knock-out blow
against the Palestinians and Syrians that would
once and for all settle the issue of what should con-

stitute the secure land of Israel. Begin’s Cabinetwas persuaded to back what was innocuously calledOperation Peace for the Galilee. In alliance with
the Christian Maronite leader Bashir Gemayel,
Sharon planned an invasion of the Lebanon as far
as Beirut to clear out the Syrians, the PLO and
their allies. A Maronite-led Lebanon would thenbecome a friendly non-Arab neighbour. Israel’shold over the West Bank and its denial of
Palestinian rights would then be unchallengeable.The decision to launch the attack came as a con-
sequence of a murderous attack on an Israeli diplo-
mat far away from the Middle East. As AmbassadorShlomo Argov was leaving the Dorchester Hotel 
in London on the evening of 3 June 1982, a
renegade Palestinian group bitterly hostile to908GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
Arafat and acting on Iraqi instructions ﬁred a bul-
let into Argov’s head, inﬂicting critical wounds
that left him paralysed. On 4 June, Israeli planes
struck at PLO targets in the Lebanon. The PLO
responded by shelling Israeli kibbutzim in Galilee.
The truce was broken. On the 6th, the IsraeliDefence Force began its operation in Lebanon.But instead of conﬁning themselves to the south-

ern Lebanon, as the watching world expected, they
knocked out the Syrian Soviet missiles in the Bekaa
Valley on 9 June and advanced four days later all
the way to the outskirts of West Beirut, where thePLO had established their strongholds.In the eyes of the world – and in the face ofgrowing opposition at home, as the Labour Party
strongly condemned the extension of the war to
Beirut – the Israelis were now playing an entirelynew role. No longer heroically defending theirhomeland, the Israeli army and air force seemed to
be indiscriminately (though this was actually not
so) shelling the districts of West Beirut; half of the
city remained under siege for more than a month.This was Sharon’s war, the culmination of hisgrand design, though neither Begin nor the Israeli
Cabinet were fully aware of his plans. On 21
August the PLO’s ﬁghting force, loyal to Yasser
Arafat, began leaving Beirut by sea under the 
protection of a multinational force, having accept-ed Israel’s terms of surrender. Nearly 15,000Palestinians and Syrians were evacuated during the
next few days by sea and land. But neither the
Syrians nor the PLO were crushed or even cowed;
they would ﬁght back another day. Sharon’s granddesign had not succeeded; rather, it had severelydamaged Israel’s international reputation and its
people’s conﬁdence in democratic government.
Nor could a stable Christian Maronite Lebanon
be reconstructed as a friendly neighbour. In mid-
September the Lebanon’s president-elect, theChristian Maronite Bashir Gemayel, was assassi-nated on the orders of Syrian intelligence. The
Lebanon was lapsing into chaos as warring fac-
tions fought each other once again.The evacuation agreement reached with thePLO contained an important clause stipulatingthat law-abiding, non-combatant Palestinians
who had remained in West Beirut and the south-
ern Lebanon would be guaranteed protection. Inthe massacre that ensued in two Palestinianrefugee camps, Sabra and Shatila, Israel’s reputa-tion suffered the most ignominious blow. The
sadistic killings were a savage revenge for Bashir’s
assassination, but the Phalangist Christians who
committed the atrocity and who hated thePalestinians, had determined on a massacre longbefore. The Israeli commanders had sent them
into the camps to clear out any remaining terror-
ists, little imagining they would also turn on
whole families, including defenceless women and
children. They should have known better. Thebodies, bloated by the sun, were shown to theworld on television. Israel was blamed for the
hundreds of dead. At a subsequent inquiry in
Israel in 1983, Sharon was judged primarily
responsible and his dismissal as minister ofdefence was urged. It is to Begin’s discredit thatthough Sharon had to quit the defence post he
remained a minister in Begin’s and successive
governments. Massive ‘Peace Now’ rallies in
Israel and mounting Israeli casualties among theforces occupying parts of the Lebanon ﬁnally per-suaded the government to order their withdrawal.The Lebanon war had been a disaster for Israel.It achieved fundamentally nothing. The Lebanon
remained torn between rival Muslim Iranian and
Iraqi factions, the Druse and right-wing PhalangistChristians. Central government was nearly power-
less and was dominated by Syria. Killings contin-

ued daily in the city, divided between Muslim West
Beirut and Christian East Beirut by the so-called
Green Line, until the Christian Forces agreed towithdraw in November 1990. The West learnt thatit can achieve nothing, by force or by diplomacy,
to bring peace to the Lebanon, even though rival
Muslim groups held Western hostages. And the
Syrians, still controlling parts of the country, were
stuck in the quagmire of conﬂict. The Syrians did
not withdraw as promised, but after 1990, underAsad’s watchful gaze, Lebanon rediscovered a
fragile peace.Begin accepted the consequences of his failure and,haunted by the many Israeli casualties, resigned inSeptember 1983, to be replaced by another Likud
hardliner, Yitzhak Shamir. The election of 1984
ended in a stalemate, with the religious parties1CONTINUING TURMOIL AND THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST909
holding the balance. Instead of giving in to theirdemands, Labour and Likud agreed on a ‘NationalUnity’ government, shared between Shamir and
the Labour leader Shimon Peres. Such a divided
Cabinet could follow no decisive policies. The
paralysing division of the Israeli electorate contin-
ued, with Likud supporters favouring hardlinepolicies on the West Bank and the Palestinian
question, and Labour supporters more ready to
ﬁnd a compromise solution. The result, as a new
generation of Palestinians on the West Bank and in
Gaza grew to manhood, was a violent challenge tothe continued Israeli occupation – the uprising, theintifada, that began in December 1987. Israel’syoung conscripts were ordered in to re-establish
control. Civil conﬂict is brutalising. Inexperienced
Israeli soldiers were unequal to the task of dealingwith stone-throwing young men and children; infrustration bullets were ﬁred, unarmed Palestinians

killed. A military curfew was imposed, which alien-

ated the Palestinians still further.Yasser Arafat was one of the great political sur-vivors, a familiar ﬁgure on the world’s stage untilhis death in November 2004; he had dedicated
his life to creating a Palestinian state. Through
terrorism the Palestinians succeeded in drawing
global attention to their cause when neither 
their Arab brethren nor the rest of the worldcared. For the Arab nations the Palestinians werepawns to be supported or rejected as their own
interests dictated, and the PLO fighters were 
fractious and rebellious ‘guests’ of their host
nations. Thus the PLO were successively expelledfrom Jordan, Egypt and the Lebanon. But Arafathad succeeded in dominating the mainstream of
Palestinians in 1969 as chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation. During the 1970s he
supported terrorism as the only effective weapon
the Palestinians had. In 1974 at the Arab summitin Rabat the Arab nations accepted the PLO asthe authentic voice of the Palestinians, a step
forward that implied independence not only from
Israel but from Jordan’s King Hussein. Arafat
came to recognise that continued terrorism wouldnow harm his cause, which needed world support.Bitter enmities developed between him and those
Palestinian factions that continued their campaign
of terrorism. But he would not condemn indi-vidual terrorist attacks against Israel either, forfear of losing support among the Palestinians whoregarded these ﬁghters as martyrs. So he spoke intwo contradictory voices: to the West he gave
assurances, which he promptly denied giving
when speaking to his own people.During the 1980s Arafat worked out a ‘legiti-mate’ strategy for creating a Palestinian state. Itwould have been unrealistic to have as its objectivethe destruction of Israel and the retaking of the
whole of Palestine. Instead, a mini-state solution
emerged. The Palestinian state would comprise
the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. To gainthe support of the US, Arafat in December 1988publicly renounced terrorism and accepted Israel’s
right to exist. Talks between the US representa-
tives and the PLO were held sporadically, but
ended when Arafat once more appeared to con-done terrorism in practice. Meanwhile, in Israel,Shamir resisted all US pressure to consider some
form of genuine Palestinian autonomy, exchang-
ing Gaza, the West Bank (or most of it) and East
Jerusalem for peace. The Israeli right also rejected
any direct negotiations with the PLO. Israeli opin-ion, however, was deeply divided and the rest ofthe world was losing patience with what appeared
to be Israeli intransigence. The continued killing
of Palestinians, and the indiscriminate shooting 
on the Temple Mount in October 1990, afterPalestinians had hurled stones at praying Jews,further alienated world opinion.Yitzhak Shamir’s coalition with Labour had col-
lapsed the previous March in bitter disagreement910GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY

Associated Press, APover the peace process. With the help of extremeright-wing religious groups, he was able to form anew government in June, offering no hope of con-

cession to the Palestinians. The government would
neither negotiate with the PLO nor allow a
Palestinian state to be created.Yasser Arafat’s cause was seriously hurt whenhe sided with Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War
after the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and he
lost his Arab friends in the Gulf who had sup-
ported the PLO with money. The Israelis, more-
over, could declare that the fears for their ownsecurity were not exaggerated, as Scud missilesfrom Iraq fell on Tel Aviv to the cheers of the
Palestinians. In August 1992 the Labour leader
Rabin, promising to seek peace, replaced the
‘hardline’ Shamir. Rabin turned out to be astough as Shamir in dealing with Palestinian fun-damentalist terrorists belonging to Hamas. The
‘peace process’, begun under the Americans’ aegis
in Madrid in October 1991, made little progress
despite round after round of talks betweenPalestinian and Israeli representatives. Rabin, intotal secrecy, now authorised Foreign Minister
Peres to negotiate directly with the PLO in
Norway. It would create new hopes for peace
only to be frustrated later.The longest and bloodiest war in the Middle Eastin the 1980s was the Gulf War between Iran and
Iraq, which in the course of eight years devastated
large areas of both countries and left at least half
a million dead and many more crippled. On 22September 1980, Iraq attacked Iran, counting ona swift victory. It was just twenty months after
Ayatollah Khomeini’s return to Teheran in
triumph on 1 February 1979. Khomeini had
rapidly disposed of the politicians and generals
still loyal to the Shah’s regime, having them sum-marily executed by secret revolutionary courts.That conﬂict between the royalists and revolu-
tionaries had cost thousands of lives and left the
economy in ruins, though Khomeini continued to
be revered by the mass of the people.The mosques with their local revolutionarykomitehs played a vital role during and after the
revolution. Once more, to the outside world Iran
appeared to be going through months of turmoiland near anarchy, with radical Muslim groups,Marxist and more moderate opposition politiciansstruggling for control of the country, with the
ulema, or clergy, acting independently as a rivalfaction. Khomeini, the acknowledged leader, at
ﬁrst kept in the background. For a time the statewas confusingly divided between a prime minis-ter and a formal government and the Islamic
Revolutionary Council. But between 1979 and
1982, the Council gradually took over real power,
ﬁrst by creating its own political party, the Islamic
Revolutionary Party, then by setting up an Islamicmilitia of Revolutionary Guards. During thesummer of 1979 the Islamic Revolutionary Party
dominated the Assembly, which produced a con-
stitution for the Islamic Republic. This laid down
that religious leadership would guide the country.There could be no other leader than the ‘GrandAyatollah Iman Khomeini’, who was also the
commander-in-chief and head of the Supreme
Defence Council. He could declare war and
peace; he was empowered to approve and appointthe president on his election by the Assembly; hewas the chief justice. The ordinances of Islam
were supreme, but the believers of Islam would
be free to debate their differences.Khomeini invariably sided with the radicals.Soon revolutionary Iran was enmeshed in ﬁght-ing the Kurds, the most nationalistic ethnicminority in the country. The Kurds’ success in
October 1979 forced Teheran to accept a com-
promise ceaseﬁre. A new enemy was branded just
a short while after – the American ‘Satan’.Khomeini, fearing a US-backed attempt to over-throw the Islamic Revolution and restore the
Shah to power, demanded the Shah’s extradition
to stand trial. The Carter administration, which
had allowed the Shah to enter a New York hos-
pital, refused. Directly encouraged by Khomeini,militant students thereupon seized the AmericanEmbassy on 4 November 1979 in a well-planned
operation to capture secret US documents, in a
bid to compromise the US as well as internal
opponents. Fifty-two Embassy staff were heldhostage for ﬁfteen months until 21 January 1981,the day of Reagan’s inauguration. In the mean-
time, rivalries among clerics and politicians in 
Iran appeared to present a picture of complete1CONTINUING TURMOIL AND THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST911
disarray. This is what tempted the Iraqis to invadeIran: the conditions seemed ideal for the defeatof an old rival for predominance in the Gulf.The immediate cause of conﬂict was the Shatt
al-Arab, the waterway between Iraq and Iran lead-

ing out to the Gulf. Should the frontier run in mid-channel or were both banks Iraqi territory? If thelatter, Iranian shipping would have to pay tolls to
the Iraqis and Iraq would control the waterway
through which oil tankers passed. The dispute goes
back to the nineteenth century, and a settlement of
1937 favouring Iraq was torn up in 1969 by theShah, who imposed the median line by a show offorce. Relations between Iran and Iraq deterior-
ated, with each country encouraging national dis-

sident movements in the other – especially of
Kurds, who straddled both countries. But between1975 and 1978 peaceful relations were restored.The Islamic revolution in Iran, however,alarmed Saddam Hussein’s socialist Baathist
regime, not least because it was condemned by
Khomeini as hostile to Islamic rule. Saddam ruth-lessly crushed the internal opposition, executingmilitant sympathisers of the Iranian Islamic revo-
lutionaries. Khomeini meanwhile called on the
Iraqi army to overthrow Saddam.Full-scale fighting began on 22 September1980 with an Iraqi invasion. The Iranian air forcedid well in response. Each side attacked theother’s oil centres, but despite advancing rapidly
the Iraqi army failed to capture the great reﬁnery
at Abadan. Iranian artillery continued throughout
the war to deny Iraqi warships passage of Shattal-Arab, while the Iranian army and the newRevolutionary Guards defended fanatically,
inﬂicting heavy casualties on the Iraqi forces and
preventing them from extending their early gains.
The conﬂict became a war of attrition – though
one which strengthened the hold of the Iranianclergy. Khomeini declared a holy war which, hesaid, would end only when Saddam Hussein, the
aggressor against the Islamic Republic, had been
overthrown. From the spring of 1982, the
Iranians, with their much greater reserves of man-power, began to gain the initiative, graduallypushing the Iraqis out of the territories they had
captured in the ﬁrst month of the war. Mediation
attempts and offers of a ceaseﬁre were rejected bythe Ayatollah because Saddam Hussein remainedin power unpunished.Young Iranians, many barely out of childhood,enlisted in the Revolutionary Guards in response
to Khomeini’s call to ﬁght evil. To die for the
faith brought glorious martyrdom and wouldensure a welcome in heaven. In the martyrs’cemetery in Teheran, ‘the fountain of blood’
graphically symbolised the sacriﬁce of life. Prayer
meetings, attended by thousands in villages and
cities, strengthened resolve. Tens of thousands of
young volunteers hurled themselves in human-wave attacks against the Iraqi defences.Saddam Hussein was equally successful inmaintaining the war spirit but less so in repre-
senting himself as the pan-Arab champion against
the old Persian foe. Syria, Iraq’s rival, backed Iranand in 1982 blocked Iraq’s oil pipeline to theMediterranean; even Israel, though Zionism was
denounced by the revolutionaries in Iran, appears
to have provided some secret technical assistance
to the Iranian army and air force. For most of thewar the Soviet Union and the US were anxiousto contain Iran and to counter the ‘export’ of
Iranian-style Muslim fundamentalism to the
USSR’s Central Asian republics or to America’s
allies in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.
The leaders of the Gulf states, which were in thedirect ﬁring line, feared Iran the most and so sup-plied money to Iraq. But fears that Iranian-style
revolutions would destabilise the Gulf states
proved unfounded.Iran suffered huge losses in driving the Iraqisout. Its forces had no hope of defeating the well-entrenched Iraqi army, whose military supplies
were purchased with Saudi Arabian, Kuwaiti and
US help. The US arms embargo, and the inter-
national ﬂeet from the West, which protected the
tankers of the Gulf states from Iranian retaliationafter the Iraqi attacks on Iranian oil installa-tions, underlined Teheran’s diplomatic isolation.
Weapons did reach Iran, despite embargoes –
indeed, the bizarre Iran–Contra affair belongs to
this chapter of secret arms deals. They were notenough to turn the war in Iran’s favour, but theywere sufﬁcient to prolong the military stalemate.Iran’s war effort was being worn down by theend of 1987. Long-range Iraqi missile attacks912GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
sapped morale in Teheran, and the enthusiasm ofrecruits was waning as Iran’s offensives failed tomake much further progress. Iraq’s use of poison
gas added to the horrors of the war. Once more
the Iranian poor suffered the most, while the 
rich could indulge in imported luxury goods.Nonetheless, Iranians, unlike Iraqis, were alloweda considerable degree of freedom to debate and
discuss. The shooting down in July 1988 of an
Iranian airliner, mistaken by a US warship as a
ﬁghter coming in to attack, helped to convince the
Iranian leadership that the American ‘imperialists’would stop at nothing. After Khomeini, the mostpowerful man in Iran was Hojatoleslam Rafsanjani,
the adroit speaker of the Assembly, a cleric and
faithful follower of Khomeini. Rafsanjani, a prag-

matist, concluded that the war had to be broughtto an end. All depended on Khomeini, who hadnever compromised or given way on a matter of
right and wrong. But the sorry state of Iran and the
inability of the military to mount any more offen-

sives persuaded him with great reluctance and feel-
ings of bitterness to side with Rafsanjani and withthose who wished to end the war. Accordingly Iran
accepted the ceaseﬁre resolution of the United

Nations. On 18 July 1988, Khomeini’s message
that after eight years the war had ended without
the defeat of Iraq stunned the Iranian masses.The death of Khomeini a year later, in June1989, tilted power more to the moderates, and
Rafsanjani took over the leading role in the
country, though the radicals remained a powerful
group. Rafsanjani’s efforts to improve relationswith the West were obstructed by a bizarre affair,the earlier publication by Salman Rushdie, a
British author, of The Satanic Verses, whichMuslims condemned as blasphemous. Violent
protest erupted in many Muslim countries, and
Khomeini pronounced a fatwa, a religious sentence of death on Rushdie, who had to go into hiding. Even after the Ayatollah’s death,
Rafsanjani was not able to undo the sentence. But
Iran’s relations with the West were improving,
buttressed by its cooperative behaviour during theKuwaiti Gulf War. It remained an importantfactor in any Middle Eastern peace order.Iraq interpreted Iran’s change of heart as a vic-
tory. In the aftermath of the war, Iraq decided tocrush the dissident Kurds in the north by killingthem with poison gas in their villages; 100,000refugees escaped into Turkey. It was a crime
against humanity, but the world did no more than
express regret. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein strength-

ened his regime’s hold killing tens of thousandsand fostered his personality cult. In 1990 a sub-
servient Assembly appointed him president for life.
The growing power and pretensions of Iraq now
began to cause alarm in the West and Israel. Its
invasion on 2 August 1990 of its neighbour,
Kuwait, over which Saddam had angrily claimedsovereignty, marked the start of a new world crisis.That Saddam Hussein should start another war sosoon after the conclusion of the devastating and
fruitless conﬂict with Iran took the West by sur-prise. Kuwait had assisted Iraq and now becameits victim. The quarrel between the small emirate
and its powerful neighbour arose out of a dis-
puted frontier and the oil ﬁeld that straddled it.
Iraq also accused Kuwait of lowering the price ofoil by over-production. Iraq was desperately shortof funds, so the oil-rich emirate was a tempting
prize to seize. Even the Arab states believed that
the dispute could be mediated with their help and
accepted Saddam’s assurances that he would not
attack Kuwait. When he did so, he caught Kuwait,Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia entirely off-guard.It was a gamble, but with the most powerful 
army in the region Saddam believed he was 
safe. Kuwait was annexed as Iraq’s ‘nineteenth
province’, though the plundering by the invadingsoldiers did not diminish. Iraq’s claim to theemirate was in fact historically spurious. Kuwait
had existed as an entity (a British protectorate in
1899 and granted independence in 1971) before
Iraq was created from the ashes of the Ottoman
Empire after the First World War.The West acted promptly, the lead given by the Bush administration in Washington. On 6
August 1990 the Security Council passed a reso-
lution that required all member states to cut off
trade with Iraq. Iraq’s main export earner, oil, wasparalysed. In all, twelve resolutions, of increasingseverity, were passed at the UN. They required
Iraq to quit Kuwait unconditionally, and on the
initiative of the US a deadline was set for 151CONTINUING TURMOIL AND THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST913
January 1991, after which date, if Iraq had not by then left Kuwait, ‘all necessary means’ to driveIraqi forces out of Kuwait were authorised. 
The Security Council was in rare unanimity. The
Chinese wished to show their respect for the 
international rule of law after the world’s con-demnation of the Tiananmen Square massacre.Gorbachev, who had met George Bush in
Helsinki on 9 September, was looking for Western
assistance to help meet the economic crisis at
home and joined the American president in con-
demning Iraq’s invasion. As the deadline drewnear, the mediating efforts of the UN secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuéllar failed, as did a 
last-minute attempt by Gorbachev.Bush acted without hesitation, strongly sup-
ported by Margaret Thatcher. Saddam Husseincould not be allowed to get away with his forcibleannexation. After Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the
other Gulf emirates would be at his mercy. As con-

troller of the Gulf’s oil, he could hold the industrial
world to ransom. Syria and Egypt were not pre-
pared to allow Saddam’s Iraq such a huge increaseof power either. Thus from the beginning the US
and Britain could count on regional Arab allies,
including of course the Gulf emirates and Saudi
Arabia, whose vast ﬁnancial reserves were at the

disposal of the alliance. A war against Iraq wouldthus not be another Western ‘colonial’ drubbing ofan Arab nation. The US mounted a tremendous
military effort, the largest since Vietnam, and the
speediest build-up of military might since the
Second World War. By the time the land warbegan, half the forces were not American, thoughthe US had made by far the largest contribution to
the ﬁghting forces on land, on the sea and in the
air. The command of the allied armies, more than
600,000 strong, was assumed by the US general
H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who soon became aswashbuckling television personality. Never beforehad almost every minute of a war been televised as
a worldwide spectacle. War was never formally
declared, and media correspondents remained in
Baghdad even through the weeks of air attackswhich preceded the land war.Bush was the acknowledged leader of theinternational effort, which comprised more than
thirty nations contributing forces, munitions orcash. Principal among them were Britain, Egypt,Syria, France, Italy, Saudi Arabia and the Gulfemirates, with further troops made up of exiled
Kuwaitis. Financial aid was provided by Germany
and Japan. Most of the twenty-eight allies had a
non-combatant role: for example, just over 200men were sent from Czechoslovakia, all of themmedical and chemical-warfare specialists, while
310 Muslim mujahideen guarded shrines. Bush
was careful to keep within the limits set by the
UN resolutions. Six months were needed to build
up a force considered sufﬁcient to deal with whatwas said to be the fourth-largest army in theworld. Meanwhile diplomacy and increasing pres-
sure failed to move Saddam out of Kuwait. As a
gesture of goodwill early in December 1990, he
released the 20,000 foreigners working in Iraq,3,000 of them Americans, whom he had held ashostages, as ‘human shields’. He indicated a
readiness to withdraw from Kuwait if a Middle
Eastern conference were called to discuss not only
Kuwait but also Israel’s occupation of Arab terri-tories and the Palestinian question, a ploydesigned to split the Arab nations aligned against
him. At worst he would emerge a hero in Arab
eyes for having forced a settlement of the
Palestinian demands. But Bush would permit no
direct linkage of the Palestine issue and Kuwait.Saddam could not be seen to have proﬁted fromaggression. The Iraqi leader now threatened ‘the
mother of battles’ for Kuwait and the use of
chemical weapons if attacked.Early in the morning of 17 January 1991 theshooting war, Desert Storm, began with air strikeson strategic targets in Baghdad. For six weeks
thousands of air sorties were mounted against
Iraqi military targets, roads, bridges and essential
services. New high-technology weapons worked
with awesome accuracy. Inevitably there were alsoinnocent civilian casualties, most tragically whenan air-raid shelter in Baghdad received a direct
hit. Iraqi counter-strikes with Russian Scud 
missiles were militarily ineffective but the devas-
tating allied air strikes were beginning to create apopular Arab reaction in North Africa, Jordan andother Muslim countries. It was overkill. By the
end of the onslaught, Iraq’s ﬁghting morale had
been sapped. When the land war opened on 24914GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
February, the high-tech armour sliced throughand completely outﬂanked the Iraqi troops. Theirnumber and ﬁghting readiness had been overesti-
mated – many of those dug in in Kuwait were half
starved and only too happy to be taken prisoner.
In just 100 hours the whole Iraqi army had beenrouted. No accurate ﬁgures for Iraqi casualtieskilled has been established; they were probably
between 30,000 and 90,000; the US suffered 389
killed, the British 44 killed, and the total for 
the allies was about 466 dead and in all about
1,187 wounded. The only real danger to theArab–Western coalition, the involvement of Israelin the war in retaliation for the Iraqi Scud missile
attacks, was averted by US diplomacy and the sta-
tioning of US Patriot defensive missile batteries
in Israel. On 26 February Saddam announcedwithdrawal from Kuwait and on the following dayIraq accepted all the UN resolutions. That same
day, 27 February 1991 Bush ordered the suspen-
sion of ﬁghting. He saw grave disadvantages to
future Arab–Western relations if the defencelessIraqis continued to be slaughtered as they ﬂedfrom Kuwait and from the areas in Iraq occupied
by allied troops. Bush also concluded that
Saddam could no longer resist whatever demands
were made and was unlikely to stay in power.
Saddam, however, signalled his defiance bysetting alight Kuwait’s oil wells as his routedtroops pulled back. It was a disaster months of
ﬁre-ﬁghting only partially overcame.An uprising by the people of Iraq wasexpected, but not the forms it took. The ShiaMuslims rebelled in the south of the country,seizing Basra, and the Kurds in the north saw
their opportunity for gaining at least autonomy,
if not independence. The Kurdish rebels rapidly
occupied the principal northern towns, as well as
the oil-rich Kirkuk district. Iraq was falling topieces. The Soviet Union, Syria and Turkey, withrestless Kurdish minorities of their own, were all
greatly concerned by the Kurdish rebellion. For
the US, the possibility of an extension of Shi’ite
Iranian inﬂuence in southern Iraq was equallyunacceptable. And so the Kurds and Shi’ites wereleft to their fate as the rump of Saddam’s forces
with tanks and aircraft brutally crushed the
risings. A ‘just’ war ended unjustly, and theWestern world and the Iraqi people becamevictims of Realpolitik. For those members of theSecurity Council with internal repressions of their
own on their conscience, China and the Soviet
Union, the principle that the UN could not inter-
fere in the ‘internal’ affairs of a country was sacro-sanct. For the US, striving for peace and stability,the raising of the Kurdish national question in
1991 seemed likely to add another explosive issue
to others already detonated in the Middle East,
foremost among them the Israeli–Palestine and
Arab conﬂict.In the face of the human catastrophe thatthreatened the Kurdish people as they ﬂed into
the inhospitable mountains of northern Iraq the
civilised world felt some sense of responsibility.
Britain and the US declared the region a ‘safehaven’ and, with air bases in Turkey and UNbacking, enforced their decision to stop any
further Iraqi military action. The UN also orches-
trated humanitarian aid though there was much
criticism at the lack of competence revealed thatwinter. During the course of 1992 the Kurdsestablished quasi-independence, with their own
guerrilla army, government and elected parlia-

ment while declaring their aim to be only a
federal, democratic Iraq. The Kurds were espe-
cially dependent on the toleration of Turkey, theirmost powerful neighbour, and therefore avoidedgoing as far as stating that their aim was an inde-
pendent Kurd nation. Iran, Syria and Turkey all
have their own Kurdish minorities and had a
common interest in crushing any such ambitions.To reassure the Turks, the Iraqi Kurds even madecommon cause with them, ﬁghting against their
own ethnic kin, the Kurdish Marxist guerrillas in
Turkey. But even Kurdish autonomy remained
precarious and was regarded with suspicion by its
neighbours. They wanted a uniﬁed Iraq, led by astrongman other than Saddam Hussein.The fate of the Shias in the south of Iraq ini-
tially attracted less attention. But Saddam’s brutal
repression, when it extended to the ethnic Arab
families living primitively in the marshes in thesouth of the country who made their simple livingfrom ﬁshing, eventually aroused the West. A sec-
ond ‘no ﬂy zone’ was declared to cover the south
to provide some, far from complete, protection.1CONTINUING TURMOIL AND THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST915
Saddam Hussein meanwhile remained in powerin Baghdad, surviving an international economicblockade and the humiliations inﬂicted by the
UN. Perhaps these were even proving counter-
productive as Iraqis rallied to their leader who 
was presented as standing up to overwhelmingWestern hostility. Saddam played a cat-and-mousegame frustrating the fulﬁllment of UN demands
that he throw open his nuclear facilities for inspec-
tion and destroy his missiles as long as he dared. It
remained in the interests of the nations in the
region and of the West to maintain Iraq as a uni-tary state and that helped Saddam to survive for solong after defeat. What appeared to be morally
right did not necessarily correspond to what were
regarded as the wider interests of peace in the
Middle East and the priorities of the world’s mostpowerful nations. Bush’s decision to stop at Iraq’sfrontier was in part based on a miscalculation, that
Saddam could not survive such a defeat but that
his successor should be enabled to hold the coun-
try together as a counterweight to Iran.General peace in the volatile Middle East re-
mained a distant prospect. But on 13 September
1993 there was one totally unexpected and dra-
matic turn for the better. On that day on the
White House lawn the Israeli prime minister,Rabin, shook the hand of PLO chairman Arafat.Their agreement had been secretly brokered by
the Norwegian foreign minister and became
known as the ‘Oslo Agreement’. Arafat signed a
letter recognising that Israel must exist in peaceand security and Rabin accepted the PLO as the‘representative of the Palestinian people’. Gaza
and Jericho were to be handed over to Palestinian
self-rule when all the details had been worked out.
There was an outcry from opponents – from
Hamas and from among the fearful Jewish settlersin 144 settlements on the West Bank and Gaza,who constitute some 4 per cent of Israel’s popula-
tion. The detailed negotiations dragged on, and
the December date for the handover passed.
Three months later a fanatical Israeli settlersprayed a mosque in Hebron, the Patriarchs’Tomb, with bullets from the automatic weapon
many settlers carry, killing thirty Palestinians;
Hamas retaliated in kind. The Israeli army wasseen to maintain order one-sidedly – ready toshoot at Palestinians, but not at Jews. It was a set-back, but there was no alternative but to try to
implement what had already been agreed in prin-
ciple in Washington. Meanwhile a resistant Hafez
Assad was cajoled by the Americans without suc-cess to normalise relations with Israel. His priordemand was that he recover the Golan Heights. In
Egypt, Mubarak came under increasing pressure
from groups of Muslim fundamentalist terrorists.
The ﬁres of conﬂict thus continued to smoulder
under the surface.Hopes of peace turned to ashes. Hamas andIslamic Jihad, based in the West Bank and Gaza,
continued to launch suicide bombing attacks on
Israel and the peace accord reached between the
PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israel’s prime min-ister Yitzhak Rabin in 1993 was in tatters. Rabinwas attacked by the Likud opposition and its
leader Binyamin Netanyahu for ‘betraying’ Israel,
and was assassinated not by an Arab terrorist but
by a Jewish fanatic at a peace rally in Tel Aviv inNovember 1995. Shimon Peres, who succeededhim as prime minister, attempted to build on the
trust Rabin had established with Arafat. But elec-
tions in May 1996 were preceded by bombs and
deaths in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv which created
divisions between those Israelis who supportedthe peace process and those who thought itwould undermine security. Netanyahu won by
the narrowest of margins. His approach was far
more hard line. By the end of 1997 Gaza and
only a small part of the West Bank had cometotally under Palestinian control. By constructinga new settlement on the southern edge of East
Jerusalem, Netanyahu brought negotiations with
the Palestinians to a halt. But his refusal to abide
by the Oslo timetable to leave the West Bank was
overshadowed by the behaviour of Arafat, whofailed to distance himself from Hamas and thecontinuing suicide bombings. Islamic Jihad and
Hamas set off bombs in buses, busy markets and
shopping streets. The Clinton administration
managed to keep the peace process alive until the election in May 1999 of Ehud Barak, whoreplaced Netanyahu. Peace hopes revived.The biggest obstacle to overcome is a legacy ofhatred and mistrust increased by the violence on916GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
both sides.Cooperation between Palestinians andIsraelis besides banishing death and destructionpromises great beneﬁts for both peoples. Can the
bridge that leads to peace be constructed? It can
certainly not be done without outside help. There
was some progress, in May 2000 Israel withdrewfrom the Lebanon though this greatly encouragedPalestinian terrorists who saw it as a victory.Arafat and Barak with their advisers werebrought together by Clinton at Camp David. The
Camp David blueprint in July 2000 that followed,
to be sure, did not offer a ﬁnal peace deal andwould have left thorny problems outstanding butit was a historic advance that proved the courage
and political will of Israeli’s prime minister Ehud
Barak. The Camp David secret negotiations had
brought the two sides closer but with character-istic misjudgement Arafat held out on the eve ofthe Israeli elections and so the window of oppor-
tunity closed. Instead of persevering with the
course of peace soon after he returned, he
believed that one more blow and shock wouldsecure more concessions from Israel on the issuesthat had broken up negotiations in Camp David
– sovereignty over Haram-al-Sharif (the Muslim
Holy sites), Temple Mount its Jewish name, over
the legal right of return of Palestinian refugees
now increased to 3.5 million of whom over amillion were herded still in camps, and over a ter-ritorial map of the new state that would be viable
and removed most of the more than 100 Jewish
settlements.The US provides most aid and support for Israeland could exert most pressure. Previous efforts to
mediate a peace had failed. The Arab world
accused the West of double standards ignoring
some UN resolutions and demanding enforce-
ment of others. Against Iraq, President GeorgeW. Bush, the son of the president of the ﬁrst GulfWar, and Tony Blair later justiﬁed war in 2003
because Saddam Hussein did not fulﬁl the reso-lutions of the Security Council. But what aboutIsrael which had also failed to carry out SecurityCouncil Resolution 242 (1967). This had called
for a ‘just and lasting peace’, for the Israeli forces
to withdraw from territories occupied in the Six-
Day War, and for a ‘just settlement of the refugeeproblem’. Fourteen other resolutions followed onissues as diverse as Israel’s settlement policy, a 
‘ﬂagrant violation’, and the abuse of the human
rights of the Palestine people. Was this not indeed
an example of double standards? This argument
is persuasively presented and has moral force butfrom a strictly legal point of view deserves closescrutiny.In the ﬁrst place Resolution 242 was rejectedby the Arab nations who refused to accept the
existence of Israel within any borders and notuntil 1993 did the PLO and Israel agree to nego-tiate to implement the resolution. There is also a
crucial difference between the dozen resolutions
concerning Iraq passed after the ﬁrst Gulf War
under the UN Charter’s Chapter Seven and theResolution on Israel and the Palestinians. On theIraqi resolutions the Security Council is empow-
ered under Chapter Seven to take all actions
including war to enforce its will.The resolutions on the Israel–Palestine conﬂictwere passed under Chapter Six where the UN actsas a mediator and makes recommendations thatare not binding on the countries in dispute
however strongly worded. From the point of view
purely of international law the distinction is
crucial.The renewal of violence undermined Barakwho was obliged to counter with the strong arm
of the Israeli army ranged against stone-throwing
Palenstinian youths. The numbers of Palestinians
killed and wounded exceeded those of the Israelis
and inﬂamed passions. The casualty was the peaceprocess and Barak’s electoral chances. Barak wasdefeated by Israeli’s ‘strongman’ Ariel Sharon in
2001. The future looked bleak.1CONTINUING TURMOIL AND THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST917
Civilisation is more than great art and literature.Where basic human rights to life, liberty and
justice are not held to be sacrosanct civilisation
does not exist. Too often it is taken for grantedby those who enjoy its prerogatives. It is fragile;the events that took place in Yugoslavia revealed
just how fragile. The reversion to barbarism there
was terrifyingly swift and unexpected. For decades
Yugoslavia, with its beautiful coastline, had been
a popular destination for millions of holidaymak-ers. No one could have predicted the descent intoviolence or the horrifying stories broadcast by 
the Western media – the shelling of medieval
Dubrovnik; the deaths of thousands of civilians in
the siege of multi-ethnic Sarajevo, whose citizenshad prided themselves on their cosmopolitan tol-erance; the pictures of skeletal concentration
camp victims and mass graves of the thousands
who had been butchered in cold blood. Millions
of refugees were forced to ﬂee from one region
to another or left Yugoslavia altogether.But why was this surge of hatred so surprising?Perhaps because Yugoslavia was seen as a Euro-
pean country and, despite the Nazi atrocities 
perpetrated during the Second World War, the
belief in Western racial superiority had persisted.At the close of the century savagery might welloccur in Africa or in regions of Asia, but surely
not in Europe or the West. This assumption
proved to be a tragic delusion. Wherever law and
order breaks down, wherever an organised lead-ership encourages murder and arson in order tosecure power, there are always willing volunteerswho, under the cloak of a cause and protected
from retribution, are prepared to commit horren-
dous crimes. They can be found anywhere in theworld – in Europe, Asia, the Americas or Africa.Who then was responsible for the conflict?What were the rights and wrongs? The Serbs
claimed that if Yugoslavia broke up then the fron-
tiers of the multi-ethnic republics should be
redrawn so that all Serbs could live in a greaterSerbia. In 1990 almost a third of the CroatianRepublic was inhabited by a Serb majority; more
than a million Serbs also lived in Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Thus Serbs would be divided
between three republics – Serbia, Croatia andBosnia-Herzegovina if their existing frontiers werepreserved. Counter-arguments were put forward
by Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia
resisted Serbia’s claims, asserting that individual
groups could not be allowed to redraw the fron-
tiers of the country they lived in and that theexisting state frontiers of the Croatian Republicwere inviolate. Inconsistently though, Croatia
wanted control of the regions of Bosnia-
Herzegovina inhabited by Croats. The geo-

graphical scattering of Croats, Serbs and Muslimsthroughout Bosnia-Herzegovina (later simplyreferred to as Bosnia) made it impossible to draw
any coherent frontiers on an ethnic basis. The
Bosnian Muslims wanted to retain a federal struc-
ture that allowed multicultural communities tolive in one republic. Only desperation had inducedChapter 78THE WARS OF YUGOSLAVIA
A REQUIEMBosnia to declare independence in 1992, knowingthat it would lead to bitter conflict betweenMuslims, Croats and Serbs.Serbia’s population of 9.7 million was twicethat of Croatia (4.8 million) and Bosnia (4.4
million), and the Yugoslav People’s Army (theJNA) generally followed orders from Belgrade.This placed Serbia in a dominant position. Presi-
dent Milos
ˇevic´’s aim was to unite all Serbs ifSerbia was no longer able to dominate a federal
Yugoslavia; he therefore regarded any declaration
of independence by Croatia and Bosnia based ontheir existing frontiers as a challenge to greaterSerbia and he was ready to respond with force.
When Slovenia, with a population of less than 2
million, declared its independence on 25 June
1991, Milos
ˇevic´had already decided that since
there were few Serbs in Slovenia it could secedefrom federal Yugoslavia with its existing territory.
After a few days of ﬁghting, the Yugoslav army
withdrew from Slovenia. Croatia followed suit
declaring its independence on 26 June 1991.Milos
ˇevic´was equally prepared to allow Croatia
to leave federal Yugoslavia provided the Croats
gave up Slavonia, a region in the extreme north-
east with a majority Serb population, and the
mainly Serb-populated territory of the Krajina
along Bosnia’s north-eastern frontier. Serb rebelleaders in the Krajina had already declared inde-pendence from Croatia. Thus Croatia was threat-
ened by rebellion from within, by Serbia and by
Serbia’s ally, Montenegro. Croatian president
Franjo Tudjman was an ardent nationalist and hewas determined to defend every inch of Croatianterritory. Bloody conﬂict became inevitable.The wars that were to cause a loss of life anddestruction in the heart of Europe not witnessed
since the Second World War proceeded unchal-
lenged for four years: the most powerful coun-tries of the West were unwilling to intervene andeven connived to reward the principal aggressor,
Serbia. At ﬁrst the European Community attempt-
ed to cool the crisis by declaring that it would
not recognise unilateral declarations of inde-pendence by any of the republics. Yet only a week later Douglas Hurd, the British foreign 
secretary, stated that a republic could not be
forced to remain in the federal state ‘by shootingits citizens’. Public opinion in Western Europehad supported Slovenia’s assertion of independ-ence. But generally the leaders in the republics
showed scant regard for the views of the European
leaders when it suited them. On 8 July 1991,
without reference to the European Community,the Slovenian declaration of independence wasformally accepted by all the Yugoslav republics;
no triumph this for EC diplomacy.However, in Croatia and Bosnia the situationwas quite different. In Croatia President Tudjman,
aware of his country’s military unpreparedness,had unsuccessfully tried to postpone an unde-clared war. The Krajina was lost to indigenous
Serb rebels; Serb ‘irregulars’, aided by the JNA,
attacked eastern Slavonia. During the autumn of
1991 the Croats stood their ground in the townof Vucovar. Its complete destruction and surren-der on 20 November after a three-month siege
shocked the West; television sets broadcast the
grim fate of the civilian population. It was only
a taste of what was in store over the next fouryears. The Croat prisoners taken in Vucovar weremassacred in cold blood or herded into concen-
tration camps, where they were starved and
beaten, their skeletal bodies reminiscent of Belsen
victims. The response of civilised Europe was
shockingly inadequate: the new military status quowas accepted without question and mediation wasoffered. A UN peacekeeping force was despatched
to Croatia, but the conquered Croat lands
remained in Serb hands. ‘Ethnic cleansing’ had
begun. This policy of appeasement was to becomea characteristic of Western diplomacy until 1995.On the Dalmatian coast Dubrovnik was bom-

barded by the JNA in October 1991 but held out
for seven months; meanwhile, in another twist,
the Serbs and Croats had reached a secret agree-
ment to carve up Bosnia between them.If it had been possible to resolve the conﬂictthrough diplomacy and mediation, then one of
the plans submitted to the Croats, the Serbs and
Bosnians by the skilful mediator Lord Carrington,
sent by the European Community, might wellhave proved a basis for ending it. There was to beno shortage of mediators. In 1992 and 1993, after
the departure of Carrington, Lord David Owen
and Cyrus Vance took up the thankless task and1THE WARS OF YUGOSLAVIA919
put forward more proposals. An early plan tried topreserve the federal structure of Yugoslavia. Thishad to be abandoned, however, when in January
1992, on the insistence of Germany, the Euro-
pean Community reluctantly recognised the 
independence of Croatia and Slovenia. There is nospace or need to describe in detail all the media-tion efforts that were launched over the following
three years. They all failed because Serbia and
Croatia wanted to enlarge their states at each
other’s or Bosnia’s expense. The United Nations
and the European Community insisted that theirmission was ‘peacekeeping’; Croatia and Serbia,however, were determined to ﬁght. As the UN
and the EC were unwilling to use force, what was
left? In September 1991 an arms embargo was
imposed by the UN on all parties in the conﬂict,regardless of whether they were victims or perpe-trators of aggression. The warring parties attended
peace negotiations chaired by international medi-
ators but in reality they followed their own agen-
das. Clearly the wars could continue indeﬁnitely inthe absence of outside intervention. But Britain,France and other European countries could not
simply watch as millions were driven from their
homes and hundreds of thousands were exposed
to starvation and death. A relief force bringing
humanitarian aid was organised under the UNﬂag. The ‘blue helmets’ had strict orders not totake sides: they depended on the permission of the
aggressors to bring aid to starving people.
Meanwhile the US washed its hands of what it saw
as Europe’s problem. American intervention aspart of another UN mission in Somalia was prov-ing disastrous, and the Clinton administration
refused to commit US ground troops to Bosnia –
Congress would not then have sanctioned it –
though a small detachment was sent to the
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, which hadseceded without entering the conﬂict. Clintoncalled for NATO air strikes and for the lifting of
the arms embargo to help the Bosnians. But
Britain and France rejected these proposals: the
lives of their soldiers in the UN force would be atrisk; hopelessly outnumbered, they had been sentin with inadequate means to defend themselves.
Indeed, had the Serbians decided to attack the
international peacekeepers it would have been dif-ﬁcult to extricate them. Thus the West, relyinglargely on bluff, had placed the UN contingents inan impossible position: for a short time they actu-
ally became hostages. The result was paralysis for
three years and Western disunity.The most bloody and cruel phase of the conﬂictbegan when the wars spread to Bosnia. The pres-
ident of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, a devout
Muslim who had been elected in 1990, recog-
nised that, with the European Community’s
recognition of independent Croatia and Sloveniain January 1992, all hopes of sustaining a federalYugoslavia were lost. Radical Serbian and Croat
minorities were already forming autonomous
communities within his country. In January 1992
the Bosnian Serbs, led by a professor of psychia-try, Radovan Karadzic, proclaimed their ownindependent republic within Bosnia, receiving
military help from Milosˇevic´. Four hundred thou-sand Muslims were driven out of the Bosnian self-
styled Republika Srpska.Serbia was in an overwhelming position ofstrength: the JNA was for all practical purposes
now under Serbian control. Although the army
had formally withdrawn from Bosnia (in May
1992) the Bosnian-Serb soldiers remained be-
hind, well armed and professionally trained.Izetbegovic’s one hope was international helpafter April 1992, when the European Community
also recognised Bosnia’s independence. But
beyond humanitarian aid and ‘mediation’ none
was forthcoming. However, on 30 May 1992,appalled by the atrocities committed by the Serbsin their campaign of ‘ethnic cleansing’ the UN
Security Council imposed sanctions isolating
Serbia and its satellite partner Montenegro, which
had remained in a rump Yugoslavia. These meas-
ures crippled Serbia’s economy but put noimmediate pressure on Milos
ˇevic´to withdraw.
Conferences in London, discussions at the UN,
advice from the Clinton administration, all fell
short of recommending intervention by force.
Britain and France were the biggest contributorsto the UN force in Bosnia, bringing supplies offood and medicines to cities and towns suffering
Serb bombardment; without a doubt this human-
itarian effort saved tens of thousands of lives. In920GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
Mostar, in central Bosnia, a long and bitter strug-gle between Croats and Serbs began in 1992; theSerbs were defeated by a tactical alliance between
Bosnian Muslims and Croats; once the Serbs had
been ousted, the victors turned on each other.
Such was the tangle of disintegrating Yugoslavalliances and alignments.The most dramatic evidence of the savagery ofthe war to reach the West was the siege of Sarajevo.
During the ﬁrst winter of the war in Bosnia in
1992 the civilian population of Sarajevo was
exposed to Serb gunﬁre; essential medical and food
supplies were dwindling. Apartment blocks, hotels,schools and hospitals were shelled and even
mourners in graveyards were killed. The main
thoroughfare of Sarajevo became a snipers’ alley.
Had it not been for the UN convoys, whichbrought in a minimum of relief, the 415,000inhabitants would have starved. Television journal-

ism once again demonstrated its powerful inﬂu-

ence over events. Pictures of devastation and
carnage shocked people in the West, who becameincreasingly impatient at their governments’ appar-
ent inability to stop the slaughter. Reprehensibly
the West continued to enforce the UN arms
embargo on all the republics. The effect of this was
to block military supplies to Bosnia’s Muslims,
while the Bosnian Serbs, despite the embargo,continued to secure plentiful arms from neigh-
bouring Serbia; the Croatians obtained theirs clan-

destinely from the West. The embargo was so
obviously one-sided that the conﬂict could only

have ended if the Bosnian Muslims, the principalvictims of aggression, had accepted that theirstruggle was hopeless.While the Serbs carried out the ethnic cleans-ing of the lands their troops had conquered –
hundreds of thousands of refugees were driven
into Croatia and beyond to Austria and Germany– governments in the West continued to insistthey could only try to alleviate the humanitarian
consequences of the conﬂict; the public was told
that NATO air strikes would prove ineffective;
intervention would mean sending in a large army.This was unthinkable: Bosnia was not the Gulf;no vital Western interests were at stake. This
meant that the war would only stop when the
Croats, Serbs and Bosnians agreed to end it.Izetbegovic, it was implied, should accept the sit-uation and allow his republic to be partitioned.But the Muslims held on amid the daily killings
in Sarajevo and in three eastern Bosnian towns,
Srebrenika, Zepa and Gorazde, enclaves sur-
rounded by Bosnian-Serb territory soon tobecome infamous as ‘safe areas’.The atrocities being committed by all parties,though largely by the Serbs and Croats, had by
now so outraged public opinion that the Western
governments, after more than two years of war,
recognised that they had to be seen to be doingsomething more. In April 1993 Srebrenika, andlater Sarajevo, Tuzla, Bihac, Zepa and Gorazde –
all towns in Bosnia – were declared by the UN to
be ‘safe areas’. It was assumed that this meant
they would be under UN protection, but the UNhad no intention of intervening to defend themby force: in international law ‘safe areas’ were not
the same as ‘safe havens’; only the latter had a
legal right to be properly defended. The public
could not have been expected to understand suchan arcane point, but the sense of outrage grewwhen the ‘safety’ of these areas proved to be a
sham. Only Gorazde was to remain in Muslim
hands. Nevertheless, economic sanctions against
Serbia and Montenegro were tightened and
increased the pressure on Milos
ˇevic´. May 1993 atlast saw a glimmer of hope: Lord Owen’s advo-cacy and Serbia’s bankrupt state combined to 
persuade the Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian 
presidents to put their signatures to a plan to end
the ﬁghting. However, this was later repudiatedby the Bosnian Serbs. It was evident thatMilosˇevic´could no longer control his former fol-
lowers in Bosnia.The ﬁghting raged on throughout 1993 and1994. The Bosnian Muslims, who had managed
to acquire some weapons, fought back. When aSerb mortar shell hit the market in Sarajevo inFebruary 1994, adding sixty-nine more deaths to
the 10,000 already killed during the siege,
Western governments expressed their outrage.
President Clinton again called for NATO inter-vention from the air but Britain and France stillresisted. Further excuse for not using force
against Serbia was raised: traditionally Russia was
Serbia’s friend and a confrontation between the1THE WARS OF YUGOSLAVIA921
West and Serbia in Bosnia might force PresidentYeltsin to defend Serbia and so lead to a wider
war. Actually it was absurd to suppose that
Yeltsin, depending as he did on Western eco-nomic help to resolve his problems at home,would have risked a war with the West for the
sake of Serbia. What was left? Eventually a NATO
ultimatum was sent to the Serbs demanding that
they withdraw their heavy weapons from thevicinity of Sarajevo. The Serbs complied only afterRussian troops had agreed to occupy the vacated
Serb positions. The public in the West again drew
the wrong conclusion; the siege of Sarajevo was
by no means over – it was merely enforced from
a wider Serb-held perimeter.The Yugoslav wars were ﬁnally brought to anend through active American diplomacy and inter-
vention. Decrying the policy followed by the
European Community, but still unwilling to risk
US lives, the Clinton administration devised a newstrategy in 1993. It hinged on Croatia, whosearmy was being rebuilt, and on secret supplies 
to the Bosnian Muslims. Tudjman was encour-
aged to recover all the Croat lands lost to theSerbs and to form an alliance with the BosnianMuslims against Serbia. The US promised to assist
Croatia’s desire to integrate with the West; if it did
not comply, however, Croatia would also be iso-lated and would face Serbia alone. In February1994 the US brought about an agreement in
Washington between Tudjman and Izetbegovic to
form a Croatian–Bosnian federation. The UN and
NATO remained as ineffectual as ever, but whenin April 1994 the ‘safe area’ of Gorazde wasthreatened by the Serbs, NATO at last agreed to a
token strike from the air. The bombing persuaded
the Serbs not to press their attack and the enclave
of Gorazde remained in Muslim control. In
August the Bosnian Serbs were facing increasingisolation when they blocked yet another peaceplan; Milos
ˇevic´, having lost control over theBosnian Serbs, now broke with them publicly,
although he could not afford to see them suffer
military defeat. Then, ﬁnally, during the springand summer of 1995 came the turning points thatwere to bring the ﬁghting to an end.In May 1995 the Croatians attacked andrapidly overran western Slavonia, defeating the922GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY

mander of the Bosnian-Serb army, captured the
UN ‘safe area’ of Srebrenika. The Serbs massa-
cred at least 7,000 Muslim men in the bloodiestsingle atrocity of the war. The fall of Srebrenikacompleted the humiliation of the UN. Further-
more, if NATO did not now respond it too would
be discredited. The Bosnian-Serb military posi-
tion was already deteriorating rapidly. In August
the Croatian army overran the Krajina, causing400,000 more Serb refugees to flee. ‘Ethniccleansing’ in Bosnia achieved by murder, arson
and terror was now, after four years of war, nearly
complete. The UN was pushed aside by NATO,
at last under ﬁrm American leadership, and dur-ing late August and early September 1995 itunleashed a devastating air attack on Bosnian-Serb military targets and communications. TheUS strategy was effective and revealed the weak-ness of earlier European policies. In October
1995, following their defeat by Croat-Muslim
forces on the ground and by NATO’s air strikes,
the Bosnian Serbs were forced, after a whirlwindround of American mediation, to the conferencetable at Dayton, Ohio.Richard Holbrooke, the tough US assistant sec-
retary of state, persuaded Tudjman, Izetbegovic
and Milos
ˇevic´to agree to ‘proximity talks’ which
would seek a compromise solution. They agreed toend the ﬁghting. Under the Dayton Accord, con-
cluded on 21 November 1995 and reached after
much complicated bargaining, Bosnia was divided
into two ‘entities’: a Bosnian-Serb republic and a
Croat-Muslim federation (51 per cent Muslim and49 per cent Serb). Under the Dayton Accordrefugees were guaranteed the right to return to1THE WARS OF YUGOSLAVIA923

suspected war criminals were to be arrested and
tried by the International Tribunal set up at TheHague; at the head of the list of war criminals wereKaradzic and General Mladic, both of whom were
still in Bosnian-Serb territory in 2004. The princi-

pal culprit, Milos
ˇevic´was left unharmed because
‘ethnic cleansing’ had created workable cohesive
territories which are now populated overwhelm-
ingly either by Muslims, Croats or Serbs. Thus thegreatest wrong perpetrated by the wars also created
the possibility of ending it. Croatia recovered
Vucovar and eastern Slavonia, sending thousands
of Serbs as refugees to Serbia. The Dayton peaceterms have been supervised in Bosnia since 1996by the 35,000-strong IFOR. It has been successful
in policing the frontiers and preventing renewed
bloodshed but not in enforcing other parts of the
agreement such as the free movement of people, orthe return of refugees to their homes; not all theprincipal war criminals have been apprehended.
Milos
ˇevic´’s next victims of ‘ethnic cleansing’ werethe Albanians in Kosovo.As long as Milos
ˇevic´remained in power in
Belgrade there could be no peace; Kosovo becamethe next ﬂash point. The Dayton Peace Accords in
1995 had ignored the issue. Kosovo a province of
Yugoslavia is inhabited by 1.8 million Kosovari
ethnic Albanians and just 200,000 Serbs. Milos
ˇevic´had risen to power on the back of beating thenationalist drum there. After Bosnia it became his
last bloody repression. The Albanian nationalist
movement led by Ibrahim Rugosa had demanded
independence as Yugoslavia was breaking up, but
Rugosa had no thought of resorting to violence.The militants prepared to ﬁght were at ﬁrst a small
group, the Kosovan Liberation Army, KLA,
founded in 1993 but of little signiﬁcance until they

acquired arms through Albania in 1997. Even so
they were no match for the Serbs. Serb attempts toannihilate them, to counter sporadic attacks ontheir police and military, led to their committing
brutal reprisals. From that point in 1998 the con-

ﬂict escalated until a massive counter-attack by theSerbs drove the small number of ﬁghters into the
hills and with them a quarter of a million Kosovansﬂeeing in terror of their lives.The West could not simply stand by as a newwave of atrocities spread through the villages and
towns, but Clinton thought he could achieve asolution through mediation and negotiation.Public opinion in Europe and the US was deeply
divided. So diplomacy was tried. In February
1999 Madeleine Albright, Clinton’s secretary of
state made a ﬁnal effort. Kosovan Albanian and
Serb delegates assembled at Rambouillet in theoutskirts of Paris. Madeleine Albright tabled theAmerican settlement terms, telling the Kosovans
that if they did not sign them they would lose
NATO support, and the Serbs that rejection
would entail the use of force to expel them fromKosovo. The terms were tough. A referendumthree years hence would decide the future of
Kosovo. The Kosovar Albanians were unhappy
and wanted immediate independence. For the
Serbs the terms were humiliation. They wererequired to withdraw their military and policewhile Kosovo would be occupied by a peace-

keeping NATO force. NATO troops would also
enter the rest of Yugoslavia. The Kosovans reluc-
tantly accepted, Milos
ˇevic´rejected these terms. In
the face of Russian objections NATO now wentahead to make good their threat. Fears that pro-voking the Russians could lead to a catastrophic
widening of the conﬂict as some people warned,
were groundless. President Yeltsin was dependent
on the economic assistance of the US quite apartfrom being unable to threaten NATO’s forcesconvincingly.NATO began bombing the Serb military inKosovo on 24 March 1999. The war had begun
without resort to the United Nations where the
Russian veto would have blocked action. Clintonexpected the Serbs to submit quickly to the airwar. But the Serbs did not withdraw. On the con-
trary they resorted to ethnic cleansing, massacring
innocent civilians and driving 800,000 Kosovan
ethnic Albanians across the borders of Albania,Macedonia and Montenegro. Here they werehoused and fed in makeshift refugee camp sites
organised in Macedonia and Montenegro by
NATO under UN auspices. The Albanians cared924GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
themselves for over 400,000 ethnic compatriots.Daily the sight of struggling men, women andchildren, fear and exhaustion etched on their faces
horriﬁed viewers as they watched the scenes on
television. Hundreds of thousands more were dis-
placed within Kosovo, no one knew how theykept alive.Bombing Serbs in Kosovo was not achievingthe expected quick results. The German and
Italian NATO allies were reluctant participants,
the Czechs were opposed, the Russians, Serbia’s
traditional protectors, had been against the warall along. For Britain’s prime minister Tony Blairon the other hand it was a moral imperative to
act and not to permit a repeat of Nazi horrors of
half a century earlier. Blair and the French presi-
dent Chirac strongly supported the US whichsupplied most of the war effort in the air.As time went by Blair agonised. The warintended to rescue and help the Kosovars was hav-
ing the opposite effect in human terms. Blair
chaffed at the US military mission of striking atthe Serbs from a height of 15,000 feet alone andurged plans to be made for a ground invasion. The
Serbs should not be left with the certainty that
NATO troops assembled in Macedonia would not
under any circumstances invade and engage the
Serbs. Clinton, however, ruled out a land war soincurring the risk of American battle casualties.The war would be won from the air alone. The air
strikes were widened to strategic targets in Serbia’s
capital, Belgrade. Power stations, oil installations,
bridges, police headquarters, Milos
ˇevic´’s own pri-vate residence, the TV station, were all targeted.Serbia was brought to its knees but not without
‘collateral’ damage, warspeak for the unintended
civilian casualties. Bombing the Chinese embassy
by mistake was one of them, causing a rift in rela-
tions with China. In Europe public opinionbecame even more critical of the tactics used. ButSerbia’s morale at the front in Kosovo began to
crumble. Five thousand Serb conscripts lost their
life many more were wounded. Some soldiers
mutinied, just went home, their parents too beganto demonstrate and Belgrade was without electric-ity. The ﬁnal blow to Milos
ˇevic´was the ‘desertion’
of Russia. But the Russians, in tough negotiations
with NATO, had succeeded in softening the termsto be presented jointly to Milos
ˇevic´. Their supportwas essential if the war was to be brought to a halt.The Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari and the Russian mediator sent by Yeltsin, Victor
Chernomyrdin took the terms to Belgrade. They
were not negotiable. The biggest concession was that Yugoslavia would retain sovereignty over Kosovo, the referendum three years hence
demanded at Rambouillet to determine the 
future was abandoned. Instead, Kosovars were
promised a vague political autonomy, nor would
NATO troops enter what was left of Yugosla-via. NATO troops would move into Kosovounder a UN mandate and the Russians would 
participate. For the Serbs, the bitter pill to
swallow was that they had to pull out of Kosovo
completely. Meanwhile, the Kosovar LiberationArmy would be demilitarised. Milos
ˇevic´was
handed the terms on 2 June 1999. After a brief
deliberation and the tame vote of Serbia’s parlia-
ment Milos
ˇevic´gave in. The war came to an end
78 days after it began. The Serb army withdrewin good order and NATO and Russian troops fol-lowed on their heels. They began to establish
some law and order over a country devastated by
the Serbs and the war, helping to restore the sem-
blance of normality. Five years later they are still
there. Kosovo is too fragile to be left to organiseitself. The refugees returned, many to ﬁnd theirhomes devastated, some mourning relatives found
in mass graves. As for Milos
ˇevic´, he did notremain in power for long.In October 2000 the opposition leader VojislavKostunica, who led a democratic uprising replacedMilos
ˇevic´as president of rump Yugoslavia and
Zoran Djindic was elected Serbia’s prime minister.
Nationalism is not dead. After all, Serbia’s aggres-
sions were not the work of one man but enjoyed
popular support. The UN demanded the handingover of all those indicted for war crimes, mainlyCroatians and Serbs, including Milos
ˇevic´, theWest was refusing all aid to Serbia otherwise. 
In February 2002 Djindic reluctantly complied.
By 2003 The Hague War Crimes Tribunal hadput more than a hundred accused on trial,Milos
ˇevic´the most prominent among them, but
twenty-three Serbs and Croats including General
Ratko Mladic, responsible for the butchery at1THE WARS OF YUGOSLAVIA925
Srebrenika, and Radovan Karadzic have beenindicted but remain in hiding protected by theauthorities. In 2003, Yugoslavia ceased to exist.
Tensions between Serbia and Montenegro had
ﬂared up but were resolved by the formation of a
loose union. Much remained to be done to restorenormal conditions and rebuild the lives and econ-omies of the people in Kosovo and the new
republics. A generation after the death of Tito, the
violent passions of nationalism destroyed a once
prospering country where the different ethnic
groups and nationalities once seemed to live witheach other. The West had acted here in the heartof Europe as they would not in Africa. Moralimperatives are relative.In 2003 Serbia was in the grip of internal tur-moil. The post-Milos
ˇevic´government was faced
with the opposition of all those who had proﬁtedunder the Milos
ˇevic´regime. Crime was rampant
and at times the local Maﬁa dealing in drugs and
extortion appeared more in control than the gov-
ernment. When Djindic attempted to suppress the
criminals they assassinated him. The Milos
ˇevic´legacy cast a long shadow over the country.926GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
New York, Tuesday morning, 11 September2001, 8.44 a.m. New Yorkers were hurrying to
start the day; the Path Line had emptied its pas-
sengers from New Jersey at the World TradeCenter a few minutes earlier. Hundreds werealready at work in downtown Manhattan in this
mini-city of banks, shops and ofﬁces, the skyline
dominated by the Twin Towers. A minute later
incredulous spectators in the street below saw a
plane approach and slam into one of the towerscreating a ball of ﬁre. A short time later anotherplane smashed into the second tower with similar
devastating effect. It was certain now that this was
no accident. The US was under terrorist attack.
After an agonising interval the towers collapsedkilling some 2,792 ofﬁce workers and ﬁremen inthe upper storeys. The whole horrifying scene was
broadcast from coast to coast on television emo-
tionally involving every American. A third plane
hit the Pentagon like a ﬂying bomb causing great
damage and loss of life. A fourth was also headingfor Washington, probably aiming at the WhiteHouse or the Capitol but was brought down by
the action of courageous passengers en route in
Pennsylvania killing everyone. The president was
hastily ﬂown to safety, the skies were cleared ofall commercial aircraft, and ﬁghter planes took tothe air. The term 9/11 became the shorthand for
identifying a threat from a different kind of enemy
– from terrorist groups sheltered by countries far
weaker than the US, sympathetic to their cause of hatred of the US and Jews the world over. Bycarrying the attack to the heart of the US, to theicons of the powers of ﬁnance and government,
9/11 proved a catalyst in the strategic thinking
of the administration of George W. Bush andmarked a sombre opening to the new millennium.When George W. Bush was inaugurated on 20January 2001 the severity of the challenges that
would soon test him lay not far into the future. 
At home he was determined to learn the lessons ofhis father’s defeat. What appeared to matter mostto the voters was the economy and it was poten-
tially not in good shape in a world downturn.
Aggressive cutting of interest rates by Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve,kept the consumers going as house prices soared.Wall Street with prices driven to extravagant
heights began to slump as the dot.com computer
upstarts with little earnings and projections to the
sky imploded. The year 2001 was in business the
annus horribilis. The unacceptable face of capital-ism came into full view. Corporate greed, the con-nivance of respected Wall Street investment
bankers and tax accountancy practices allowed the
crooks to make hay at the expense of the innocent,
it was also the decade of greedy punters buyingshares. Exemplary was the bankruptcy of a hugecompany, Enron, in December 2001, followed by
World Com and others in its wake. Spectators
were regaled with millionaire directors being
escorted in handcuffs to waiting police cars.Respectable Wall Street bankers had hyped their1Chapter 79THE ‘WAR ON TERROR’
stock, and accounting ﬁrms had been creative inpassing accounts. Arthur Anderson, one of themost respected, went bust as a consequence.Something had to be done to restore the battered
image of capitalism gone wild. Congress tightened
the rules, a good start. Fundamentally the US
economy is the strongest in the globe. The adjust-
ments in the new millennium have been painful. Bush followed traditional Republican policiesand those of the conservative coalition that backed
him in some areas opposing gay marriages, abor-
tion and stem cell research. Deregulation reﬂected
Republican views on the need for small govern-ment. As the Clinton years drew to a close, theeconomy was in a fragile state and Bush was not
responsible for the bursting bubble of technology.
He countered with large tax reductions. New jobs
were created although not enough to mop up allthose unemployed by the changing pattern of theeconomy. But traditional Republican policies were not the whole story. Bush wanted to exhibita ‘caring conservatism’. Medicare for the elderly
was increased; in the wake of 9/11 the intelli-
gence services were reorganised into an enlarged
‘Homelands Security’ apparatus; Bush’s ﬁrst termwas particularly noteworthy for giving federal sup-port to education. The ‘No Child Left Behind
Act’ introduced national testing and standards,
the federal budget for schools was greatly
expanded. Inevitably, the deﬁcit has ballooned not
least because of the increased burdens of militaryoperations and reconstruction in Iraq.President George W. Bush earned highapproval ratings and in the November 2002 mid-
term congressional elections the Republicans
gained control both of the House and the Senate.Americans trusted Bush’s leadership after the cat-aclysmic terror attack on 11 September 2001.When George W. Bush entered the WhiteHouse there had been still room for discussion
and debate about timing and priorities. There wasa sense that a ﬁrmer policy abroad was requiredthan Clinton had followed. The appointments 
of Donald Rumsfeld as secretary of defence, and
Paul Wolwowitz, old hands of his father’s team,
shows that Bush was in sympathy with their views.
Colin Powell, the general who had been in chargeof the ﬁrst Gulf War was the new secretary of state,Dick Cheney was the vice-president. Rumsfeld
and Cheney during the Clinton administration
had already reached their own conclusions where
the new danger lay – the nexus between ‘roguestates’, weapons of mass destruction and terrorists.Bush too in his autobiography published in 1999
wrote that the US faced a dangerous ‘world of ter-
ror and missiles and madmen’, warning that,
‘Peace is not ordained, it is earned’. Bush went on
to identify two countries, ‘that hate our values andresent our success’ – North Korea and Iraq. Thelisting was not exclusive, however, as Bush
promised to deal ﬁrmly with ‘regimes like that’.
Before the elections the presidential candidate did
not use the word ‘war’, but he probably alreadyrecognised that the ultimate resort to force couldnot be ruled out as Clinton had done. This pas-
sage in his autobiography is not so very different
from the dangers he encapsulated in the ‘axis of928GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY

Reuters/Corbisevil’ speech two years later adding Iran to therogue countries.President Bush is no simpleton causing amuse-ment because of his lack of spontaneity in speech
and at times tongue-twisting phraseology. Many
Americans underrate their presidents as they didReagan. It is a healthy attitude even when wide ofthe mark. A graduate of Yale and the Harvard
Business School, with commercial experience,
Bush’s hard drinking days were long behind him
as he embraced Christianity. His alliance with the
evangelical wing of the Church aroused liberalconcern and misgivings. His brash Texan manner,love of the ranch, the very regularity of his life now
in a White House steeped in prayer conveyed a
narrowness of outlook that was discomforting for
some and inspirational to others. A ‘vision’ politi-cian he followed his gut instincts, ready to leadwith his chin forward, but not without guile and
calculation. He expressed tolerance to religions
other than Christianity as long as he believes they
share ethical values; with so many people ofMexican descent in his home state, he is alsomindful of ethnic and cultural diversity. Colin
Powell became the ﬁrst African American secretary
of state and Condeleeza Rice, the national security
adviser, in 2005 became his successor. A
Republican at heart believing in meritocracy, inthe spirit of American enterprise, stern law andorder and in encouraging people to look after
themselves, Bush wants to reduce government in
most areas of life limiting the state’s responsibility
to provide the means to improve their own livesespecially through education. But hard politicalrealities required compromises. His sense of right-
eousness was at times hard to bear in the wider
world especially his brusque way of putting
America ﬁrst, spurning international cooperation
when he judged it not to be in America’s interest.His strength lay in reducing complex situations to simple fundamentals. But this can become a
source of danger too if insufﬁcient attention is
given to complex problems. In Iraq, he under-
estimated the difﬁculties of reconstruction and ofcreating democratic government after the militaryvictory. He is also impatient of international
forums, which require constant adjustment to the
views of others. But allies could not be dispensedwith altogether, they were useful not only diplo-matically and militarily, but helped to convinceopinion at home of the rightness of American
action. Of the major powers though, only Britain
was ultimately prepared to follow through.
President Bush and Prime Minister Blair in 2004saw their popularity plummet as difﬁculties in Iraqand the Iraqi prisoner abuse dominated the media.The new stance of American policy soon madeitself felt. Bush repudiated the Kyoto Treaty; the
US could not hope to fulﬁl the Kyoto Treaty
requirements on the environment, though themain single contributor to pollution, withoutharming the domestic economy. Bush refused to
sign up to the UN International Criminal Court,
to try cases against individuals anywhere in the
world. The Yugoslav human-rights abuses com-mitted in former Yugoslavia had led to the settingup of a special court to try the principal perpe-
trators but it is not a permanent court; the exist-
ing International Court at The Hague can only
hear cases between nations. In any case, the long-drawn-out trial of Milos
ˇevic´did not inspire much
conﬁdence. The new UN International Criminal
Court, however, is a permanent body of judges.
Most signiﬁcant in 2001 was the unilateral ending
of the Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty by the
US which, during the Cold War, had provided adeterrent against nuclear conflict. The Bushadministration wished to free its hands to pursue
efforts to provide an effective shield against
incoming missiles. Did these policies mark a
return to isolationism? In the twenty-ﬁrst century‘America first’ is no longer synonymous with isolation. The experience of 9/11, alone, was
enough to dispel such illusions. The Bush admin-
istration sent the message that it would take ﬁrm
action not procrastinate. One consequence of 9/11 was the reordering ofpriorities, Afghanistan replaced Iraq as the ﬁrst
‘rogue state’ that had to be dealt with. A rogue
state, according to the Bush doctrine, was a state
aiding and harbouring terrorists or threateningthe world with weapons of mass destruction. InAfghanistan, Osama Bin Laden had established
bases for al-Qaeda terrorists, Muslim fundamen-
talists dedicated to waging war against the US1THE ‘WAR ON TERROR’929
and the Jews. Until Osama bin Laden settled inAfghanistan under the protection of the Talibanregime, the US and the West had taken little inter-
est once the Soviet Union had been driven out
by the mujahideen armed by the West. The
Taliban were in possession of the capital Kabuland ruled the greater part of the country theycontrolled with harshness, adopting an extreme
form of Islamic law which denied women all edu-
cation and human rights. They enjoyed the
support of Pakistan even though most of the 
2 million refugees who had fled the country were housed primitively in tents on the bordersof Pakistan and in Iran. The events of 9/11
changed the American attitude of neglect.The Bush administration demanded theTaliban hand over Osama bin Laden. Merelyattacking the terrorist bases with missiles was nolonger enough. If the Taliban did not give up
Osama bin Laden and their support of terrorism,
the Americans intended to get him. The Taliban
chose to resist. In the war that the US unleashedthe Bush administration secured broad inter-
national moral support but only substantial mili-
tary assistance from Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Britain. With armchair military experts predicting
a long and bloody involvement in the inhospitable
terrain of the country, the war was soon over. The Taliban collapsed in mid-November 2001.Carefully directed bombing and a few hundred
allied troops had achieved the result. The secret
weapon had been the longstanding rivalry and dis-
sent among the Afghan war leaders. The Talibanhad never subdued the whole country. The‘Northern Alliance’ of a motley of rival warlords
supported by Iran continued to fight a long-
drawn-out civil war. Now, with the foot soldiers of
the ‘Northern Alliance’, supported by American
and British special forces, helped along by dispers-ing dollars on tribal leaders willing to turn on theTaliban, the regime was broken.The problem of reconstructing the country dev-
astated by more than two decades of invasion and
wars now faced the US and the UN peacekeepers.A transitional government headed by HamidKarzai was installed after a UN-sponsored confer-

ence of Afghan leaders, but can hardly venture
beyond Kabul and had to be protected byAmerican soldiers. The US was happy to work withthe UN as long as it supplemented and did notcross American policies. Aid came in but was only
sufﬁcient to prevent living conditions worsening;
in the countryside, stricken by drought, the illicit
trade in opium remained a main means of liveli-
hood. Nation building is a long-term process withmajor cities and regions under the control of local
commanders. To ensure that the country does not
slide back into civil wars, the build-up of an effec-

tive Afghanistan national army is only in its infancy;
from bases in Kabul and Bagram a UN-mandatedinternational force of 5,000 peacekeepers operate,and 9,000 US troops hunting Bin Laden and other
terrorists are stationed in the country. All this
would not be achieved in just a few years.With the Taliban ousted from Kabul and al-Qaedadriven out of Afghanistan, the Bush administration
turned its attention to Iraq. Saddam Hussein was
defying the United Nations which demanded veri-

fication of the complete destruction of Iraq’sweapons of mass destruction: chemical, biologicaland nuclear. Until satisﬁed Iraq was placed under

sanctions and only permitted to export a limited
quantity of oil to pay for food and medication. UN
inspectors from 1991 to 1998 searched for the
weapons and destroyed large quantities of chemi-
cal installing equipment that could no longer bereplaced without UN knowledge. In December
1998 Saddam Hussein expelled the inspectors
declaring sanctions should be ended and that Iraq
did not possess any prohibited weapons. From1999 to 2003 no one could tell whether he waslying. Of his ambitions to acquire them and, if pos-

sible, manufacture a nuclear bomb, there was little
doubt in the West. The two ‘no ﬂy zones’ protect-

ing the Kurds in the north and the Shias in the
south were no guarantee that Saddam Husseincould be contained, in future years, by economicmeasures and from the air. In secret contacts 
with the help of Arab intermediaries Blair had
attempted to persuade Saddam to comply with the
UN security resolution to allow inspectors back inreturn for a suspension of sanctions, and held outhopes of their complete abolition. But appease-

ment only made Saddam more intransigent relying
on the weakness and divisions of the West.930GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
The change of administrations in Washingtonand 9/11 broke the charade of UN resolutionsand Saddam’s non-compliance. Intelligence
sources were receiving reports that he was devel-
oping and hiding weapons of mass destruction.
Without inspectors now for three years no onecould be sure what was going on. The nightmarescenario was that when ready he would be able 
to threaten the West with his missiles and biolog-
ical and chemical weapons or pass them on to a
group of terrorists, even al-Qaeda. In January
2002 Bush warned that the US would not simplywait to be attacked but would strike ﬁrst. He singled out Iran, Iraq and North Korea, ‘States
like these, and their terrorist allies constitute an
axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the 
world’; containment was no longer enough whileweapons of mass destruction were believed to bereadied for use. The countdown for the removal of
Saddam Hussein, ‘regime change’, had begun. 
A reluctant Bush was persuaded by Powell and
Blair, who ﬂew to meet Bush at Camp David inSeptember 2002, to follow the UN route and putmaximum international pressure on Saddam to
disarm. Bush was sceptical whether Saddam would
give way but on 12 September 2002, for the sake
of broad support internationally and at home he
went before the UN and delivered a powerfulspeech – the UN must ensure compliance with itsresolutions or would be condemned to irrele-

vance. Saddam appeared to give way permitting
the return of UN inspectors without conditions.
Then on 8 November 2002, the Security Councilpassed Resolution 1441 threatening ‘serious con-sequences’ if Saddam was found to be ‘in material
breach’ of the commitment to disarm, with a
timetable set for disclosing fully all his chemical
and biological weapons and programme on
acquiring nuclear capacity, or evidence that theyhad been destroyed. The resolution was not astough as it sounded. It set a date for disclosure but
no ﬁnal date for the destruction of such weapons
if they existed; it set no date either for a ﬁnal
report by the UN weapons inspectors, imposingno time limit on their search. Above all, ‘seriousconsequences’ was not the same as automatic war
and who would decide what constituted a sufﬁ-
cient ‘material breach’? It was not clear whether asecond UN resolution would be required beforeIraq could be attacked. Only with the help of suchfudges was the Security Council’s unanimous
approval of Resolution 1441 passed. On 27 No-
vember 2002 an advance party of the inspectors
arrived and, as required, Saddam handed them avoluminous report in December purporting to bea full disclosure of the forbidden weapons which
they claimed to have destroyed. The inspectors
found little except some missiles with a range
slightly over what was allowed. Their reports 
to the UN in January and February 2003 wereambiguous; Hans Blix the chief UN weaponsinspector asked for more time adding that Iraqi
cooperation was improving and that the offending
missiles were being destroyed. Saddam claimed to
have no weapons of mass destruction but Bushand Blair were convinced he was lying. They wererelying on secret intelligence reports, which have
turned out to be unreliable when not totally
wrong. Much of the information or misinforma-
tion was fed to Washington by Iraqi defectors.Meanwhile, the build-up of US and Britishtroops continued until early March; 250,000
were stationed mainly in Kuwait with a division
at sea waiting to enter in the north through
Turkey. The onset of extreme heat and the need
to not keep the troops waiting too long had seta military timetable to strike before April 2003.But internationally the conditions for the two
allies were far less favourable than at the time of
the ﬁrst Gulf War when Saddam’s invasion of
Kuwait placed him in clear breach of UN oblig-ations and international law.In Europe the majority of public opinion wasagainst war. In Britain public approval was linked
to securing a second resolution from the UN
authorising war. Already the previous summer
Gerhard Schröder, Germany’s chancellor hadelectrified his election campaign declaringGermany would not participate in a war. Despite
bad economic conditions at home it swung a
wafer thin majority in his favour at the cost of
breaching good relations with the US. In France,President Chirac was acclaimed for ‘standing up’to the US and insisting that the UN could not be
bypassed. Turkey, America’s staunchest ally, had
elected an Islamic government in the autumn of1THE ‘WAR ON TERROR’931
2002 and the new parliament would not permitground forces through its territory and wasalarmed that a war with Iraq would lead to
Kurdish independence. For significant military
support the US could only count on Blair who
faced a deep split in the Labour Party if he failedto secure a second resolution. In Britain themajority of the public was opposed to war
without UN approval. Diplomatic support, how-
ever, came from NATO’s new central European
partners and, alone among the major powers,
Spain. In Spain too public opinion was over-whelmingly against war but Prime Minister JoséMaria Aznar deﬁed the mood at home. He did
not intend to stand for re-election in 2004. On
10 March 2003 the prospects of UN support 
on the Security Council for a second resolutionevaporated when President Chirac took the leaddeclaring that he would veto a second resolution
authorising hostilities ‘no matter what the cir-
cumstances’. Powell’s attempt to win over the
Security Council had failed, the evidence heplaced before the Council of proof that Saddamwas hiding weapons of mass destruction was not
convincing. Bush had gone along the UN route
to the end. Perhaps if the weapons inspectors had
been allowed more time as France, Germany and
Russia argued, and found illicit weapons, theSecurity Council would have authorised theforcible disarmament of Saddam, but as there
were none Saddam would have remained in
power provided he had also fully disclosed his
plans. Bush and Blair in any case were not willingto wait – there were too many ‘ifs’; the troopscould not be kept for weeks on end in the desert.
Blair secured a legal opinion at home that war was
justiﬁed on the basis of past UN resolutions; with
the help of the Conservatives he gained in parlia-
ment a decisive majority despite the opposition ofa substantial section of his own Labour Party andof the Liberal Democrats. The case he made in 
a dossier, parts of which were subsequently 
found to be dubious, supported by intelligence
reports including a claim that missiles and weap-ons of mass destruction could be readied in ‘45minutes’, secured a majority in parliament with
Conservative support as Labour was split and
Liberal Democrats voted against. The ‘45-minuteclaim’ was not well supported; the real troublewas that it connected in the public mind with athreat to the British Isles, not to the region or theBritish bases in Cyprus. Actually Saddam had no
missiles that could reach Cyprus let alone Britain
and few left to counter an invasion. The dossierthus came to be misinterpreted. The intelligencereport that Saddam could ready chemical and bio-
logical weapons in Iraq was not questioned byBlair. Convinced that Saddam Hussein was an
immediate danger, he put the case more force-
fully to parliament and the country than a dis-passionate assessment of the evidence would havejustiﬁed. When, after the war was over, Britain’s
scientiﬁc advisor on weapons of mass destruction
briefed the media secretly of his doubts, and then,
after he was exposed to investigation, committedsuicide, the subsequent Hutton enquiry exoner-ated Blair of blame but revealed the degree of
‘spin’ that heightened initially more sober assess-
ments. In the US, Bush had already obtained
congressional backing after his victory in the mid-term November elections. But suspicionswere not allayed in the West about America’s
reasons for being willing to go to war.Was the fear of weapons of mass destructionfalling into wrong hands the true reason for
attacking Iraq or did the US aim to gain control of the oil? Looked at short term oil was not theissue. Iraq’s oil supplies were not crucial to the
West, war might well lead to Saddam setting ﬁre
to the wells and anyway it would take many mil-
lions to repair them and the infrastructure beforesubstantial supplies of oil could be restored. Long-term oil was a crucial issue, not the oil of Iraq
alone but the oil of the Middle East on which
Western economies depended. If Saddam domin-
ated the Middle East he could hold Western econ-
omies hostage. Iraq under Saddam threatened todestabilise the whole Middle East. He couldincrease tensions between Palestinians and Israel
to the point of doomsday conﬂagration. That was
the nightmare scenario. More immediate, was a
genuine fear that Saddam could not be left todevelop his weapons. In Blair’s words, ‘we knewthe threat, saw it coming and did nothing’.Bush’s motives were multi-faceted. He con-curred with Blair but was also determined to bring932GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
about a change of regime. Saddam was an affront,a ruthless dictator. He would ﬁnish the businessbegun by his father who had allowed Saddam to
remain in power. Transforming Iraq and creating
representative institutions there, would send a
powerful signal throughout the Middle East thatthe era of dictators, theocracies and feudal dynas-ties was passing. If they remained unreformed and
presented a threat, they would know that the US
had the power and the will to act. A more demo-
cratic Middle East would remove regimes spread-
ing hatred against the US. That was the hope andexpectation. The sense of ‘mission’ proved hard to sustain when confronted with the realities 
the occupation faced after the fall of Saddam
Hussein. Bush and Blair recognised that the
Israeli–Palestinian problem could not be allowedto fester and poison relationships. The Palestinianauthorities would have to eradicate the terrorists
attacking Israel, a condition for Israeli withdrawal
and the creation of a Palestinian state. A stable
Middle East was important for world peace andfor the world economy. It would all be far moredifﬁcult to reach than even the difﬁcult path Bush
and Blair knew lay ahead.But was war justiﬁed in international law? The
afﬁrmative answer to that on strictly legal grounds
proved contentious. Was ‘regime change’ a legiti-
mate aim? It was not a new question. After theCongress of Vienna in 1815 the continental mon-

archs had wanted to crush revolutions in neigh-

bouring states as a danger to their own stability. In
response, Britain had laid down a ‘doctrine of non-intervention’; there could be no concerted inter-
ference by a coalition of countries in the internal
affairs of another country unless what was happen-

ing in the country constituted an imminent danger
to its neighbours. On that basis the League of
Nations and the United Nations of SovereignStates was founded. Pre-emptive attacks are hardto justify in international conduct and law unless it
can be shown the dangers and threats are immi-

nent. Without evidence of such a danger, however
brutal the regime, in international law, foreignintervention is not permissible unless authorised bythe UN. But is such an interpretation of law appro-

priate in the twenty-ﬁrst century? Can a country be

expected to wait until a nuclear weapon has beenbuilt and is ready to be ﬁred from an openly hos-
tile nation? Ought not the gross abuse of human
rights lead to intervention, though the conﬂict of

national interests at the UN may not always make
it possible to secure UN backing? International law and coming to the aid of innocent people mayalso at times be in conﬂict. A commission of wise

men appointed by Kofi Annan proposed new
guidelines. The Bush administration would have
preferred to act with the United Nations, but ulti-
mately, when it regarded its national intereststhreatened, was not prepared to defer to any inter-

national restraint. International law has limitations
– that reality has been demonstrated time and time
again. The UN has played important roles in inter-
national conﬂicts but is not the ﬁnal arbiter in the
real world.Before dawn on 20 March 2003 the war beganin Iraq with a surprise missile attack on a complexin Baghdad. Intelligence had reported Saddamwas there. The missile failed to decapitate the
regime. This was followed by more devastating1THE ‘WAR ON TERROR’933
Tony Blair, 1997. © Sean Aidan, Eye Ubiquitous/Corbismissile bombardment directed at Saddam’spalaces, as well as the ministries and commandcentres. Inevitably there were innocent civilian
casualties in surrounding houses when a missilelanded off-target. It bore the euphemistic descrip-tion of ‘collateral damage’ which the US pilots
had done their utmost to avoid. On paper a 
large regular army and elite Republican Guarddivisions were defending the country. There wasanxiety that Saddam when cornered would resort
to chemical warfare. In Washington, Donald
Rumsfeld was criticised for believing that heavybombing and a relatively small armoured forcewould lead to rapid defeat. Those who said the
war would be a ‘walk over’ were derided. As it
turned out, Baghdad and practically the wholecountry was in allied hands in three weeks.Saddam’s armed forces exposed to heavy air
attacks just melted away. Trouble came from the
militias and fanatical Baathist party adherents whoﬁred on the invading force. On 7 April the Britishforces took Iraq’s second city, Basra; two days
later the Americans were in Baghdad, and duringthe following two days Kurds in the north occu-pied Mosul and Kirkuk. The oil wells remained
intact. The war against Saddam was won by some
255,000 American troops, 45,000 British, 2,000Australian and token support from 400 Czechsand Slovaks and 200 Poles. Allied casualties were
light, more caused by accidents of ‘friendly ﬁre’
than enemy action, some 150 killed, woundedand missing including the death of thirty-threeBritish soldiers and airmen. Iraqi losses can only
be estimated, possibly 2,400 troops and 6,400
civilians killed or wounded, but Iraqi deaths maywell have been much higher. At least the war wasno repeat of Korea or Vietnam.The much harder task of creating a stable post-Saddam Iraq without a strongman terrorising thepeople lay ahead. Power, water and electricity hadto be restored in a situation where law and order
had broken down and looting was widespread.Corruption, more than sanctions, had deprived thehospitals of essential medical supplies. The situa-

tion could not improve until the corruption and
the insurgency were rooted out. The vacuum ofpower needed to be ﬁlled as speedily as possible
and there were plenty of claimants after the war
had ended in April 2003. Neither Britain nor theUS wanted to remain longer than they had to. Theoccupiers proved ill-prepared for what lay ahead.The isolated attacks, in which the soldiers were 
suffering continuous casualties from fanatics,inﬂicted more lossess than during the war. Theattacks became more widespread, better organised,
aimed at Iraq’s fragile infrastructure as well as all
foreign intervention. The UN headquarters inBaghdad were bombed causing heavy loss of life; the UN withdrew and only returned the fol-

lowing year with a skeleton staff. Local Iraqi dis-

content was being exploited by terrorists, some ofwhom inﬁltrated from outside Iraq. The capture of Saddam Hussein in December 2003 did not, as
was expected, diminish the attacks on coalition
forces. In 2004 they escalated and spread from militant Sunni to militant Shias. The ﬁghting that
erupted after April 2004 was the worst the country
had seen.The Shia insurgency lessened in the autumn of2004 thanks to the intervention of the GrandAyatollah Alial-Sistani who brokered a peace in
the holy city of Najav. The younger more juniorAyatollah Muqtada al-Sadr who formed a militantgroup known as the ‘Mahdi Army’ appeared
ready to enter the political process leading to elec-
tions in January 2005 that will replace the interimgovernment of Iyad Allawi. The biggest prize wasthe cessation of ﬁghting and the insurgency in the
north-east of Baghdad, the rundown quarters of
Sadr City, where two million Shias live. The otherinsurgency of Sunnis in the so-called Sunni trian-gle west of Baghdad raged furiously in Fallujah.
A particularly ruthless leader, a Jordanian fanatic
Musab al-Zarqawi, emerged in 2004 inspiringmore martyr car bombings, targeting foreignersand Iraqis working for Americans especially the
Iraqi police not caring how many innocent civil-
ian bystanders were killed in the crowded streets.The kidnapping of foreigners and their gruesomeexecutions shown on videotape destabilised the
country and undermined efforts of reconstruc-tion. The capture and destruction of Fallujah byUS forces supported by Iraqis in November 2004
did not end the Sunni insurgency. Some 138,000
US troops and 9,000 British were not sufﬁcientto ensure peace and order, and the build-up of aneffective Iraqi army will take time. But Bush was
determined to succeed.934GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
The US and Britain expected to be greeted asliberators. Saddam’s brutal repression and murderof tens of thousands of Iraqis found in mass
graves justiﬁed the belief that his fall would begreeted with joy by the majority of Iraqis. But thefeelings of the Iraqis were always ambiguous.
There was also a sense of humiliation at the defeat
and occupation by foreigners. The interim Iraqicouncil gained no popular support, subject as itwas to American control. The largely American
and British troops became increasingly mired in
the task of subduing militant groups of Sunnisand Shias. The restoration of normal life, suppliesof electricity and medical services was slow. The
two governments were shown to have prepared
inadequately for the aftermath of defeatingSaddam with wholly insufﬁcient resources for thehuge task of reconstruction. The use of heavy
armour in cities, mounting innocent Iraqi civilian
casualties, no time set for the ending of the mil-itary presence and the restoration of completeIraqisovereignty, played into the hands of a violent
minority.The ‘exit strategy’ was not clear and the USadministration could not abruptly change course
before the November 2004 presidential election.
The partial handover to a transitional Iraqigovernment at the end of June 2004, unable toconclude any binding agreements, was deﬁned by
the coalition as the restoration of Iraqi sover-

eignty. But coalition troops under foreigncommand remain. The eruption in May 2004 ofthe scandal over the abuse of Iraqi prisoners
undermined the acceptance of US and British
troops even further. Now Washington andLondon had to concede that the provisional Iraqigovernment had the right to require their with-
drawal. The abuse played into the hands of the
terrorists with serious consequences for anyWestern intervention in the future. No one knowshow high Iraqi civilian casualties have been
during the war and its aftermath. Estimates rangefrom 18,000 to 100,000. Despite Sunni threatsand suicide car bombers, 8 million enthusiastic
men and women cast their votes in Iraq’s ﬁrst
democratic election, January 2005. Bush’sunequivocal lead with Blair’s support and UNassistance sent a powerful message throughout
the Middle East that the tide of reforms will, overtime, prevail, even while terrorism scars theregion. During 2005, Iraq was sent on the difﬁ-cult path of parliamentary rule, agreeing on a new
government and a constitution, preparing the wayfor the withdrawal of foreign troops.Many Muslims accuse the US of oppression inIraq, feelings inﬂamed by the misdeeds of errantsoldiers torturing Iraqis held in prison, andoppression in the Palestinian territories indirectly
by the one-sided backing of Israel. In Arab eyes,
after the Iraq war, the US is less trusted as anhonest broker than in any earlier decade.The conflict between Israel and thePalestinians lies at the heart of wider deep divi-
sions. Israel is the only genuine democracy in theMiddle East and its political culture and Westernorientation present a challenge to the Arab world.
Israel was largely a Western ‘implant’, its ﬁrst gen-
eration overwhelmingly coming from outside theregion. Its military hardware has been supplied bythe West ensuring that Israel maintained an edge
of superiority over its neighbours. Israel receivesthe largest amount of aid from the US and Jewishfund raisers from all over the world. The Israeli
economy and society are Western and in terms of
Purchasing Power Parity its Gross DomesticProduct per head is almost double that of oil-richSaudi Arabia, all the more remarkable given the
lack of its natural resources. Israel’s defeat of its
Arab neighbours and occupation of land thatonce belonged to them is a source of Arab nation-alism and deep resentment. The struggle against
Israel and Zionism is a weapon in the hands of
Muslim fundamentalists in secular-ruled Arabstates, and also a temptation for secular rulers toexploit to gain popularity. A settlement of the
Israeli–Palestinian conflict would reduce inter-

national tensions within the region but it will notsolve the internal problems of the Arab states ortheir relations with the wider world.Any settlement has to involve Jewish settlersleaving the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.Some hundred and forty Jewish settlements scat-

tered throughout the territories of the West Bank
and Gaza and populated by some 220,000 settlers,many of whom were recent immigrants and aremilitantly orthodox, are under threat and attack
from their Palestinian neighbours. Arafat shied1THE ‘WAR ON TERROR’935
away from trying to reach an agreement; he fearedloss of control and an assassin’s bullet if he com-
promised. Instead, he veered in the opposite direc-

tion. The provocative tour of Ariel Sharon ofHaram-al-Sharif, underlining Israeli sovereignty,provided Arafat with the opportunity in September
2000 to launch a violent attack on Israeli soldiers
organised by his Fatah militia who are easily able toinflame youngsters in the streets facing Israelitroops and tanks. The Palestinian youths threw
rocks and home-made bombs, the militia attacked
with guns and mortars. The Israeli army ﬁred back.
Every day the funeral corteges of young men,heroes to the cause, inﬂamed passions further.
That is how the second intifadabegan. It wasa gamble that sacriﬁced many innocent lives andmisguided freedom ﬁghters. The Israeli army hitback hard; they did not target civilians who were
not involved, but the young nervous conscripts
did not always exercise all necessary care, the heli-copters ﬁring into Palestinian ofﬁces and houseswhere Hamas leaders were believed to be,
accepted that there would be civilian casualties,‘collateral damage’.The ﬁrst political casualty of the failure to reachagreement was Barak. For Israelis their security was
the electoral issue that overshadowed all others.On 6 February 2001, Ariel Sharon, the hard manof Israel with an unsavoury past in the Lebanon,
leader of the Likud party, was elected prime 
minister. Sharon had identiﬁed in the past with the
policy of expanding the settlements as a way ofcontrolling the West Bank and denying Palestinian
statehood. Defying UN resolutions the settle-
ments continued to expand, indeed they neverstopped doing so. By the Palestinians this wasinterpreted as showing that the Israelis were never
serious about fulﬁlling the Oslo Agreement of

1993 which was supposed to have led to a Pales-tinian state by 1999. The Israelis blamed thePalestinians for not ending the murderous attacks
by Hamas and other terrorist organisations whichsent suicide bombers to Israeli cities killing civiliansindiscriminately. Nor was a stop put to the open
incitement to what was called martyrdom. Suicide
bombings were followed by Israeli reprisals which,in turn, led to the despatch of more bombers tocafés, bus stations, markets, wherever Israelis were
to be found in large numbers. Living under terror,the majority of Israelis were more concerned abouttheir own safety than historic justice for thePalestinians, or that casualties and the suffering in
the Palestinian territories far exceeded that of theIsraelis numerically. If the Palestinians could notput their own house in order, then were the Israelis
left with any alternatives? Some Israelis deplored
excessive use of force, all were weary after decadesof conﬂict but doubted that peace was withinreach. A measure of the weariness has been support
for the idea of total separation and the building of
a protective wall and fence. Construction began. Itis not just one wall but several dividing Palestinianterritories, where it will run depending on the ﬁnal

decisions. Clearly, large slices of the West Bank will
be placed on the Israeli side to protect settlers andwhat is left won’t constitute a viable Palestinianstate. Most of the fence and wall remains to be
built so there is room for ﬂexibility. But Sharon’s

wall has strong Israeli support as the best way tostop the bombers getting through. Though theUS counselled restraint, from a broader point of
view the overriding US policy has been one of sup-
porting Israel ﬁrst, the Palestinians coming second.After the second Iraq war the US, the EuropeanUnion, the UN and Russia have sponsored yet
another initiative, the ‘Road Map’ to a peacefulresolution with a vision of two nations, Palestineand Israel cooperating and living side by side.
Setting out a blueprint without enforcement or
sanctions will not be enough in the absence of areadiness to make difﬁcult compromises, the car-
rots of aid not sufﬁcient to ensure success when the

future security and prosperity of both peoples are
at stake. Presented at the end of April 2003 it setsout strict goals and a tight timetable. The ﬁrst
phase was the most crucial. Within just one month,
the Palestinians were to take immediate action to
end violence, accompanied by Israeli supportivemeasures and security cooperation, and stop allincitement. Palestinians were to take steps to build
up institutions leading to free elections. A condi-
tion of the Road Map was that Arafat appoint aprime minister and by implication reduce his 
powers. The Palestinian authority was to undergo
fundamental reform. A more hopeful start wasmade when Mahmoud Abbas and his Cabinet were sworn in. The new prime minister made an
unequivocal declaration that he was willing to end936GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
all violence. After a short truce, violence resumedwith Hamas killing twenty Israelis on a bus inAugust 2003. Arab neighbours, Egypt and Jordan
are to be associated in a security cooperation planforming, together with the US, an oversightboard. The Israelis made security a precondition of
delivering their supposedly ‘simultaneous’ steps –
the ‘immediate’ dismantling of settlement out-
posts erected since March 2001 and a freeze onsettlement expansion and easing the lives of the
Palestinians. An independent Palestinian state with
provisional borders and a ﬁnal comprehensive and
permanent settlement was to be reached in 2005.There was no attempt to spell out the solution to
the most intractable problems, the territorial via-

bility of the Palestinian state, the future of thesettlements, the division of Jerusalem and the issueof the return of the refugees. The Israelis submit-

ted reservations, the plan was not unconditionally
accepted by them. The US gave assurances thatduring negotiations the reservations would betaken into account.Soon after the signatures and handshaking thePalestinians and Israelis were left to themselves.Pressure on Arafat secured the appointment of a
prime minister of the Palestinian authority. The
ﬁrst one resigned and the second, Ahmed Qurei,appears to be powerless to restrain the murderousassaults by suicide bombers against Israel. The
Israelis, with the lack of progress, did not disman-

tle any major settlements on the West Bank andmade only a few efforts to stop their expansion.Negotiations at lower levels got nowhere. Both
sides blame each other. Israeli ‘targeted’ assaults
on Hamas leaders; the paraplegic sheikh AhmedYussin in March 2004 and his successor onemonth later. That missile strikes from the 
air kill and wound Palestinian bystanders was
accepted by Israel as inevitable collateral damage.On the West Bank the Israeli wall and securityfence, constructed to protect settlements and
Israel, reduced the death toll in Israel and sogained public support. Ariel Sharon with the back-
ing of President Bush embarked on unilateral solu-

tions in 2004. He wishes to persuade Israelis to
withdraw from Gaza and to accept the removal ofsome 7,000 settlers. That would leave over a mil-
lion Palestinians in the control of Palestinians, sup-

posedly the government of the PalestinianAuthority, but Hamas is dominant in the Gazaterritory. Likud turned down the plan, but areshufﬂed coalition gave its consent; conﬂict in

Gaza is still likely. The Road Map awaits resurrec-
tion as the only plan forward in existence. All thatis happening in the present is not supposed to pre-

judice a ﬁnal negotiated settlement of the remain-

ing huge obstacles – the borders of the Palestinianstate and Israel, the future of Jerusalem, compen-
sation or implementation of the Palestinian ‘right
of return’ and the future of Israeli settlements.
Meanwhile the Palestinians remain cooped up,subject to searches and border controls for thosefortunate enough to work in Israel, largely unem-

ployed and dependent on welfare. The Israelis live
under constant threat of terror, the economy isbadly damaged by military expenditure and theabsence of tourist income, and condemned by the
Arabs and many in the Western world as well. The
moderates on both sides have little prospect ofcoming together without fundamental changes.The preconditions for progress are absent – the
democratic reform of the Palestinian authority, the suppression of Hamas and groups of killers(martyrs in the eyes of fanatics), moves on the
Israeli side to ease the burdens on the Palestinian
civilian population, ending Israeli strikes killingalso the innocent and the removal of settlements.The death of Yasser Arafat in November 2004provided a new opening. On the Israeli side, the
formation of a Labour–Likud coalition between
Sharon and Peres places the pull out plan from1THE ‘WAR ON TERROR’937

2005, who may be able to reduce the corruption
of the Palestinian authority and could create an
administration that can persuade Hamas to endsuicide bombings and violence, bringing to anend the intifadaand Israeli retaliations that havekilled hundreds of innocents in ‘collateral
damage’ although militants were targeted. Israel’s
neighbours also want to achieve a settlement.
Much too will depend on more even-handedpressure, above all from the US. The creation ofpeace between Israel and the Palestinians is a
great prize to win, the road ahead still full of dif-
ﬁculties, twists and turns. Does the Muslim militancy mark the opening ofnew war of ideology and culture between the
Muslim and the Western world in the twenty-ﬁrst
century?One-ﬁfth of the world’s population is Muslim.Like other people, Muslims’ overwhelming wish isto live peaceful lives. Islam encompasses many dif-
ferent peoples. The Muslims of Indonesia have no
more in common with those in Algeria than
Christians in India with Christians in Germany.
Some Muslims live in secular states, such as Egypt,others in countries where religious leaders exertgreat inﬂuence. Saudi Arabia is ruled by a feudal
hierarchy, Syria by a clan-based autocrat, Morocco
by a monarchy, Tunisia has an elective presidency,
Iran a form of theocracy; they are all very differentsocieties. There is far greater diversity than merelythe divisions between Sunni and Shia. Muslims
have generally been swayed by national allegiances
rather than by common religious bonds; conse-
quently, they are also divided among themselves.
Fears in the West confuse a revival of Islam withthe terrorist perversions of fanatical minorities.Since the 1970s there has been a strong resur-gence of religion in the Muslim world. This
revival criticises the values and questions the
materialism of the West, asserting an Islamic iden-tity after decades of Western colonialism. Both onan individual level and in the secular nations 
of the Muslim world Muslims have attempted to
reverse the decline of Islam. But Islam has notturned its back on modern science and technol-ogy. In 1997 Iran was on the brink of achievingthe complete literacy of its people; it also made
birth control freely available. Reformers such as
Mohammed Iqbal, the Indian philosopher and
poet, revived the message of Islam in the twenti-eth century; his aim was to combine the Islamicway of life with the best elements of life in the
West. Muslim communities have established
themselves in the West and, despite racist attacks,
have made a large contribution to national life,
fostering a greater acceptance of multiculturalsocieties. Such people have nothing in commonwith the fanatics who use their own interpretation
of ‘holy war’ to sanction the killing of innocent
men, women and children. Most Islamic organi-
sations work peacefully and constructively withinthe political systems of countries they live in andcondemn the terrorists out of hand. The danger
is that frustrated youths despair of social and eco-
nomic improvements in the West and in countries
of the Middle East, oppose regimes relying oncoercion, and turn to fanatical Muslim leaders forthe promise of a new and better life.The resolve of militant Islam was strengthenedenormously by the humiliation suffered by Arab
armies in the 1967 war and by Israel’s occupation
of more Arab land. Israel was the principal enemytarget, along with any Arab leader who was readyto make peace. Egypt’s President Sadat fell victim
to the terrorists’ implacable hostility. The Iranian
revolution provided a boost to militancy and Iran
provided weapons and training to the Lebanese-based Hizbullah (Party of God), who successfullyfought to drive the Israelis out of their southern
‘security zone’. Radical groups also won the sup-
port of the poor by setting up, in close association
with mosques, schools, clinics and social services
in deprived urban areas from Cairo to Algiers.Events in Algeria serve as a good example.In Algeria radical Islamic groups have alsocaused thousands of deaths in an internal conﬂict
against the regime. The West was forced to pay
attention when Europeans became involved:bombs exploded in the Paris Metro and therewere fears in France of unrest among the Algerian
population. In Algeria the socialist policies of the
only party, the FLN, who were in power from938GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
independence until the beginning of the 1980swere ineffectual and the country remained eco-nomically dependent on France. The FLN then
embarked upon economic reform and, in 1989,
introduced a multi-party system. But these aus-
terity measures caused hardship which, followingthe general Islamic revival, contributed to thesuccess of a powerful new movement in Algeria,
the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).In the June 1990 municipal and regional elec-tions the FIS defeated the FLN in the majority of
councils, raising fears that the general electionscheduled for June 1991, would produce anIranian-style revolution. It was postponed until
December when, despite government manipula-
tion, the FIS won easily and routed the FLN. In
January 1992 the military intervened and abro-gated the election results. A few weeks later theFIS was banned. It was the end of the democratic
process and the beginning of a bloody civil war.
FIS leaders were arrested and their newspapers
and publicity banned. Radical military groupswere formed on the fringes of the FIS, terroris-ing Algiers and the surrounding villages. Their
trademark was to kill all the inhabitants, even the
children, by slitting their throats. The army
appeared unable or unwilling to defend the pop-
ulation. The military regime tried to gain legiti-macy by holding parliamentary elections in June1997 but these were boycotted by the FIS. The
carnage continued, and claimed tens of thousands
of victims.Since 1992 more than 77,000 killings werecommitted by terrorist groups and their military.No UN or outside intervention stopped the
killings and France did not intervene either. In
May 2002 President Abdelaziz Bouteﬂika, elected
in 1999, called new parliamentary elections,
which he described as a ‘matter of life and death’for the country. Moderate Islamic parties com-peted, five parties boycotted them. Bouteflika
won but the turnout was low and the Algerian
regime backed by the generals inspired little con-
fidence that it could help Algeria’s economicdecline, or advance the country to greater democ-racy and heal the violent internal dissension.Algeria, a country on the doorstep of Europe,is a challenge to human rights. The internal vio-lence deters foreign investors. In the new millen-nium there is only the hope that the country’sdecline can be reversed.How much longer in the new century can funda-
mental change be held up in the Middle East? Therulers of the Arab nations of the regions will resista transformation according to the American model
of democracy. Nowhere is this more true than in
Iran. Ultimate power rests with the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khomeini, the successor of the Imran
Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the IslamicRepublic who overthrew the secular Shah. Thedemand for change from mullah rule is voiced by
the democratically elected parliament, the majlis
and Muhammed Khatami, chosen by the popular
vote of the majority of the people in 1997 and2001. In 1999 a student-led outburst of protestwas violently suppressed. The mullahs became
more circumspect in 2003 with the shadow of the
US threatening Iran, one of the three countries
listed by George W. Bush on the ‘axis of evil’. Afterthe overthrow of Saddam Hussein they have takencare not to provoke the US openly by appeals to
the Shias in Iraq. With the return of Shia clerics
who found refuge in Iran, the Shias are an import-

ant political factor in the future of Iraq, but the
majority do not wish to copy the Iranian modelknowing in any case that the US would not toler-
ate the setting up of an Islamic republic abusing
human rights. Iran is poised on a delicate balance.
In the new millennium sooner or later the mullahs
will not be able to retain their grip on the levers ofpower and the lives of the people. They have beencareful to allow the voice of opposition to be chan-

nelled through Khatami, a cleric and reformer as a
safety valve for the popular discontent of a genera-

tion that has grown up since the revolution of
1979. But through the uncompromising judicialsystem applying sharia law, they have periodicallycracked down on individuals and on street protests
they deem in danger of getting out of hand.
Khatami has accepted repression. He only wishes
to change the balance not to overthrow the Islamicrepublic. His lack of success in bringing about anyfundamental change, however, is increasing the
possibility of a violent end. Khatami’s second term
of ofﬁce – only two are permitted – ends in 2006.1THE ‘WAR ON TERROR’939
Who will replace him? Confrontation between the majority of moderates in the majlis and theunelected clerics was resolved by forcing out the
moderates in the February 2000 elections. A
twelve-member Council of Guardians responsible
to the Supreme leader appointed for life, theAyatollah Khomeini, has powers that override the President and Parliament. The Guardians can
veto any laws passed by the majlis that they declare
to be incompatible with the constitution and
Islam. They control parliamentary candidates 
and the judiciary which savagely punishes anyonedenigrating mullah rule. When in November 2002Hashem Aghajari was sentenced to ﬂogging and

death for blasphemy, attacking the religious rule 
of the ayatollahs and criticising the peoples’ readi-

ness to emulate them like ‘monkeys’, the studentserupted and were not pacified by Khomeini’sassurance that the sentence would be reviewed.
Police and troops under the clerics came down
hard on them and once more restored order.Iran is a country full of contradictions. Not asextreme as the hated Sunni Taliban, for instancewomen enjoy full access to education. From time
to time the moral police makes examples of men
and women behaving immodestly in a non-
Islamic way, at other times outside Teheran they
close their eyes to the freedoms practised by theyounger generation. Surprisingly prostitution iswidespread. The middle classes feel relatively free
in their lifestyles, only conforming outwardly.
The attractions of Western life are irresistible and
not necessarily incompatible with Islam. Butdemocracy cannot coexist with theocracy. Thereis much corruption, the police are paid to ignore
a party; satellite dishes provide an illicit window
to the wider world. Freedom of speech and
information does not exist, newspapers are shut
down, arbitrary arrests and exemplary punish-
ments are commonplace. The morals police is par-ticularly stiﬂing in the cities, above all in sprawling
Teheran inhabited by 12 million people. Despite
the potential of oil and gas riches, the inefﬁciency
of state control keeps most of Iran’s rapidlyincreasing population trapped in poverty with onein ﬁve unemployed. ‘Hatred’ of the US is artiﬁ-
cially organised and not shared by the Iranian
people who long for the riches of Western lifedenied them. Despite the atmosphere of fear andrepression, Iranians were able to express their atti-tudes in the only democratic elections, despite
their failings, held in the Arab world. They could
choose and change the ‘sub-leadership’ of presi-
dent and majlis, and do so in opposition to thewill of the conservative clerics. After 2003 thiswas no longer true. The clerics banned more than
2000 of the opponents from standing as candi-
dates at elections in February 2000. The out-
come: a conservative Majlis is compliant now, and
the previously reforming Khatami has lost the will to do more. The likely future? A split amongthe clerics and a less hands-on interference in the
political and everyday life of the people is possi-
ble. Iran’s isolation as a pariah state, despite its
place on Bush’s axis of evil, is breaking down asEuropean nations have adopted a less hardlineapproach and wish to proﬁt from business. But
the freshly elected president is determined to
maintain US pressure on the clerics to relinquish
power and with it the threat of nuclear-based hos-tility. The clerics will not risk a devastating warwith the US and will make the minimum conces-
sions needed, especially in its nuclear programme.
For a time the West will live uneasily with a dif-
ﬁcult neighbour. Reform in Iran is encouraged by
Western examples but it is likely that it will haveto be brought about by Iranians themselves.The longevity of rulers whether secular orIslamic is one characteristic of the Arab Middle
East, only death or revolution removes them. The
list is long: Chairman Arafat (1953–2004),Egypt’s Mubarak (1981– ), Syria’s Hafez Assad(1970–2000), followed by his son Bashar more
of a ﬁgurehead for the ruling Baathist party. The
family heads of Arab clans raised to royalty have
longevity inbuilt: in Jordan, King Hussein
(1952–1999) and in Saudi Arabia, King Fahd.There have only been two supreme leaders – theayatollahs – in Iran since 1979, and Gaddaﬁ, one
of the younger long-lived rulers, has ruled since
1969 in Libya. But a new generation is emerging
during the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century.Parliamentary sovereignty and free elections, thedevelopment of the political parties opposed to
each other but working within an agreed consti-
tutional framework took two centuries and more940GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
to develop in the West. Even with the accelera-tion of historical change since 1945, it will taketime before the Middle East’s cultures are recon-
ciled with democracy and then they will not nec-
essarily follow Western examples. That is what
makes the outcome of the new beginnings in Iraqso important and fascinating. The West will needto show understanding and respect.Syria, like Iran, has supported terrorist groupsagainst Israel. It, too, is under threat from the
US. The death of Hafez Assad in 2000 endedthree decades of repressive rule in Syria which, atthe height of brutality in 1982, killed 10,000 fun-
damentalist Sunni Muslims threatening Baathist
control. The Assads are members of the minority
Alawite Druze sect, the majority of Syrians areSunnis. Hafez Assad designated as his successorhis second-eldest son Bashar, after his older
brother, better trained for the role of autocrat,
died in a car crash. Parliament changed the con-
stitution to allow the dead president’s will to bedone and speedily elected Bashar who had onlyreturned to Syria six years earlier after the death
of his brother, abandoning his training in London
as an ophthalmologist. The Syrian elite are the
military who had ruled under his father and
wanted no change, and in particular not his uncleliving in exile after a failed coup against his father.In old age, Hafez Assad had won something of a
place as an elder statesman in the Middle East,
courted by America and Britain to cajole him to
make peace with Israel. Israel was prepared toreturn most of the Golan Heights but Assadwould not compromise. His support of Hizbullah
in the Lebanon ﬁghting Israel placed him in line
to join the ‘axis of evil’. Assad was careful to draw
closer to the US, providing intelligence assistance
against al-Qaeda terrorist plans and voting forSecurity Resolution 1441. Assad also took care toavoid a direct confrontation with Israel which he
had no hope of facing alone. The experience of
the 1973 war was enough to convince him of the
futility of armed conﬂict. What he could not bringhimself to do was to conclude a peace. No peace,no war and continuing Palestine–Israeli conﬂict
allow Syria to station troops in the Lebanon.
Another beneﬁt of his stance was for his weak andpoor country with a population of just over 16million to receive the undiminished attention ofthe international community. The state-run
economy is inefﬁcient and the standard of living
dependent on the weather and the price of oil.
The impact of the overthrow of Saddam Husseinwill make Syria even more cautious.The link between terror, al-Qaeda and binLaden pointed to Saudi Arabia. Yet relations
based on oil and the defence of the royal house
which had been close with the US and the West
weakened during the Iraq war, when unlike thetime of the ﬁrst GulfWar, the Saudi Arabian royal
family gave little support. In 2003, the US with-
drew its large military bases which affronted
Muslim fundamentalists and were one of bin
Laden’s principal targets to attack. Under theailing King Fahd, despite promises by crownprince Abdullah, reform made little progress. The
younger generation with little prospect of gainful
employment is restless, the economy declining
and totally dependent on the ﬂuctuations of theprice of a barrel of oil. With the US bent onpushing democratic reforms, the royal family itself
is divided on future policies.The conservative House of Saud, facing themenace of Nasser’s republican movement seeking
to embrace the Arab world in the 1960s, appeasedthe one power in the country that would be able torally the people against it, the Wahabi clerics who
guard the two holiest shrines in the Muslim world.
The clerical establishment is vehemently anti-
Western, its religious teaching became a breedingground for Muslim fundamentalism, Osama binLaden was one of its pupils. Before 1993, when
global terrorism ﬁrst began to take hold with the

activities of al-Qaeda, the US and the West paid lit-

tle attention to the growing popular dissent with
the royal ‘family’ whose hundreds of princesmonopolise positions in the state and live in opu-
lent luxury. It was quickly noted that Osama bin
Laden was the son of a wealthy businessman in
Saudi Arabia, a contractor and friend of the king.
Although he had left Saudi Arabia and establishedhis base ﬁrst in Sudan and then in Afghanistan, the links with Saudi Arabia remained strong. Al-
Qaeda receives money from Saudi Arabian private
individuals and members of the ‘family’ all closely

intertwinedand recruits ‘martyrs’ among the Saudi
Arabian youth. Fifteen of the nineteen hijackersresponsible for the atrocities of 9/11 were of 
Saudi Arabian descent. The presence of the ‘inﬁ-
dels’, Western businessmen and the US military on Saudi Arabia’s holy soil has been a prime target
of al-Qaeda, and was demonstrated ruthlessly
again in May 2003 when three compounds hous-
ing Westerners were simultaneously car bombedwith devastating effect, killing and injuring many.
In the new millennium the Saudi Arabian royal
establishment of princes is caught between theextreme clerics inspiring terrorism, the discon-
tented young without prospect of meaningful
employment, huge debts, declining income, the
US which demands the rooting out of terrorismand attempts to slow changes to a pace not threat-
ening their feudal rule and privileges. They have
begun to crack down on terrorism and hope they
can hold on with a minimum of concessions.Egypt is the West’s most important partner in the Middle East. The fourth election of HosniMubarak in September 1999 to a six-term periodof presidential ofﬁce has maintained Egypt’s sta-
bility. Parliament is weak, there is a lack of party
tradition essential to the workings of democracy.Elections in 1995 and 2000 to the parliamentgave overwhelming majorities to the ruling
National Democratic Party, but the opposition
Muslim Brotherhood also secured a few seatsdespite interference in the electoral process which Mubarak publicly deplored. Democracy
has evolved little in the last two decades. Long
periods of ofﬁce breed corruption in the bureau-cracy. Mubarak enjoys wide-ranging powersunder the constitution and used them to crack
down hard on Islamic extremists whose most
spectacular atrocity was the killing of tourists vis-iting Luxor in 1997. That an individual extrem-ist may succeed in assassinating him, is one of the
facts of life many Arab leaders face. His prede-cessor Sadat was assassinated and there have beenfour attempts on Mubarak’s life. In his mid-
seventies in 2005, Mubarak may have to give way
to a successor in the not too distant future whowill be faced with demands for change.With a population in the new millennium of68 million, it has been a struggle to ﬁnd employ-ment for new generations entering the jobmarket. Purchasing Power Parity per head of pop-ulation was $3,670 in 2000. Mubarak’s economic
liberalisation has beneﬁted industrial developmentbut Egypt is still dependent on 2 billion dollarsof aid received annually from the US. As a leader
of the Arab world, the continuing Palestine–
Israeli conﬂict places strain not only on relationswith Israel but also with the US, closely identi-ﬁed with Israel. Public frustrations ﬁnd an outlet
in anti-American demonstrations. Nevertheless,
Mubarak has been an anchor of stability in thevolatile region, keeping Arab nationalism incheck.Jordan is a small kingdom sandwiched in avolatile region. It lost the most admired of MiddleEastern leaders, King Hussein in February 1999.The country he ruled has a parliamentary consti-
tution but was in reality dependent on Hussein’s
initiatives. Urbane, educated in Britain and theUS, after the disastrous war in 1967 when Jordanlost the West Bank, he became a mediator and
peacemaker. In 1970, ‘Black September’, heousted the militant Palestinian LiberationOrganisation (PLO) who threatened to under-
mine the kingdom. Then in 1994 he signed a
peace treaty with Israel and shortly before hisdeath attempted to broker a peace deal betweenthe Palestinians and Israelis. Peaceful relations in
the region are essential to the small kingdom of 
5 million people, the majority of whom arePalestinians. Hussein appointed his son Abdullahto be his successor. With his Palestinian wife,
Abdullah has held to the peace course set by his
father and emphasised the equality of Palestiniansand Jordanians in the kingdom. Jordan has a spe-cial status in the Middle East as guardian of the
holy Muslim shrines in Jerusalem. This has given
Jordan more weight in diplomacy than wouldotherwise be the case. In the new millennium thetwo regions were smouldering. Tensions burst
into ﬂame between Iraq and the West and Israeland the Palestinians. Peace in the Middle Eastdepends on ﬁnding tolerable solutions to both.Colonel Gaddafi, the most unpredictableleader of the Middle East, lived up to his reputa-tion in 2004. He shed his image of supportingterrorism, agreed to give up weapons of mass
destruction, nuclear and chemical, that he had942GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
earlier hoped to construct and was received as aprodigal son by Western leaders. Sanctions werelifted and with Western investment in oil he hopes
to restore his country.Islamic terrorists inspired by al-Qaeda haveattacked all the established regimes in the Middle
East whether secular like Syria, Egypt and Jordan
or Muslim like Saudi Arabia. The common enemyhas created shared interests with the US and theWest. The defeat of Islamic terrorism is the pri-
ority aim of all and with it the preservation of sta-
bility. But shared interests had to be balancedagainst the growing Arab anger at the way theWest has acted in Iraq since the second Iraq war as well as the US support of Israel. The oneregime that best weathered this crisis withoutundue damage is Iran. The clerical leadership has
posed no threat to the region; discontent amongthe younger generation with clerical authoritari-anism was held within bounds. Democracy and
freedom of the individual is a ﬁne vision for the
future but wherever authoritarian regimes havebeen removed a transitional phase with strongleadership has been one way forward. The chal-
lenge is to bring about accountability to the
people, popular control of government, ratherthan necessarily slavish copies of the Westernforms of democracy.1THE ‘WAR ON TERROR’943
It is strange that at about the time of a new century the world moves in a different direction,
not exactly in 1901 or 2001 but close to it. New
directions were charted in 1789, 1914 and then
twice in the last century, in 1945 and the mid-1990s. As the twenty-ﬁrst century unfolds, thethreat of great global wars over ideological and
power conﬂicts has passed and with it the danger
of a nuclear holocaust. Conﬂicts have not sud-
denly disappeared – far from it, but they are con-tained and unlike 1914 or 1945 are not spreadingglobally between the most powerful nations.Bilateral wars will continue to break out espe-cially on the African continent, but the inter-
national community has the means to end them ifit so wills. The loss of human lives will occur farmore through internal wars and ethnic hatreds
and if the international community does not step
in these can still cause hundreds of thousands of
deaths as in Rwanda. The ‘war’ on terror, the 
so called ‘clash of civilisations’ is of an entirely different order. Because the casualties are in theWest with death tolls in the tens or hundreds – the
Twin Towers so far uniquely in the thousands –
this ‘war’ attracts more attention than the hun-
dreds of thousands in the Sudan or the estimated4 million over the past years in the Congo.Disease, hunger and the lack of a tolerable human
environment in many parts of the world cause
continuous suffering and mortality. Compared 
to the blood-soaked twentieth century no wars
between nations are being fought in Asia, theAmericas and Europe.In the new millennium the downturn of theworld economy from its low point in 2001 has
been overcome. But the World Trade Organisa-
tions talks – the Doha round in September 2003 –
made no progress in liberalising trade further. Therich and poor countries are at loggerheads. TheEuropean Union and the US would not abandon
export subsidies of farm products, the most con-
tentious issue. Rich countries subsidise cotton,
crushing poor West African growers. The USappeared to be determined to protect its cottonfarmers. The concessions by the US and EU were
too small to satisfy the poor countries. Then in the
spring of 2004 the EU offered major concessions
and the US promised to match them. Suddenlyprospects improved. Global freeing of trade isbeing supplemented by regional and bilateral
deals.The upturn in world trade in general has bene-ﬁted both rich and poor. The improvements of
two countries have pulled the rest of the worldforwards – the US and China. The possibility of arecession in the US in 2000 and 2001 was avoided
by setting interest rates at the lowest point ever.
Consumer spending and housing allowed the
economy to grow by a modest percentage, but asit is the biggest economy in the world even a smallpercentage translates into a large absolute amount
of goods and services. George W. Bush has bene-
ﬁted from the upturn. The good feeling at home,
and greater conﬁdence in his ﬁrm leadership in the
ﬁght against terrorist groups outweighed dissatis-faction with developments in Iraq. Bush won theChapter 80INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUMTHE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
elections for the presidency in November 2004convincingly against Senator John Kerry, theDemocratic contender. It was a victory not somuch for conservatism or the moral Christian
alliance, as for a decisive leader. But the US is
clearly geographically divided. At least there was
no repeat of the uncertainties of 2000.Across the Paciﬁc, China has maintained anastonishing rate of growth. The Chinese way has
been to open the economy to foreign investment,
to join the World Trade Organisation and, with
the advantages of its vast supply of cheap labourand lack of concern for the environment, tobecome the ‘workshop of the world’ in many
branches of manufacture. As Japan and the West
outsource production and invest in China, the
rate of growth is continuing as the vast country
is perceived to be stable.Stability is secured at the expense of democ-racy. The Western clamour for reform soon sub-
sided after the Tiananmen uprising, China is too
valuable a trading partner. China is also appeased
by the Western rejection of Taiwanese independ-ence, potentially the most inﬂammatory issue inthe eastern Paciﬁc. The US has an undertaking to
defend Taiwan against an attempt by the People’s
Republic of China to take the island by force.This provides the US with leverage and restrainedPrime Minister Chen Shui-bian whose party nar-rowly defeated the more moderate Kuomintangin the March 2004 elections.In facing North Korea, a military state withnuclear capability, theUS has found in China a

useful partner counselling restraint on NorthKorea’s leader. China has become a respectedglobal partner integrated in the world economy.
There are still huge problems. The glittering
wealth of Shanghai and coastal China contrasts
with the poverty of much of the hinterland. Thesector of state ﬁrms remains uncompetitive, but
progress has been achieved. Over the decade
employment in the state sector has been halved,
though it still accounts for a third of all urban
employment. The Chinese banking system sits on
top of a huge non-performing debt that in anormal market economy would have led to a ﬁnan-
cial crisis. Corruption remains widespread, it
matters who you know.The leadership papers over the contradictionsbetween the ofﬁcial ideology and realities. Thusin the supposedly communist state privatelyowned businesses increase year by year by 20 per
cent creating employment and drawing in invest-
ment. The leadership supports the private sector,1INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM945
Rwandan genocide, 1994. © Reuters/Corbisrecognising that the future of China depends onit. In March 2004 private property rights weredeclared ‘inviolable’.What is left of the former Marxist state is theone-party system. Hu Jintao replaced Jiang
Zemin as party chief in 2002 and president in2003. His style is more in conformity with amodern leader, dispensing with a fawning media.
The Chinese people enjoy greater personal free-
dom. But the reform of the party, despite Hu
Jintao’s call encapsulated in the exhortation of the
‘Three Represents’ that the party should ‘repre-sent’ advanced productive forces, advancedculture and serve the people, remains no more
than a vague aspiration. The leadership fears that
genuine encouragement at the grass roots of elec-
toral choice, even within the party would openthe ﬂoodgates. The pressures for reform comefrom the intellectuals, a small group that can be
contained. The Chinese leadership is not prepared
to take risks when so much progress has been
achieved. Higher living standards have engen-dered compliance with the system, protected bya large army. The new urban middle class is
content to enjoy the fruits of their enterprise.While Japan’s annual economic growthremained sluggish, about a ﬁfth of China’s, its
economic output (GDP) is ﬁve times as large asChina’s with a population of 127 million com-pared with China’s 1,300 million. Japan’s econ-
omy is the second largest in the world after that of
the US. But Japan has contributed little to global
growth. Is the once dynamic tiger permanentlyslowed by old age? Since 1990 an upturn wasanticipated almost every year and never happened.
In 2004 the economy ﬁnally did manage to perk
up, not spectacularly, but for Japan in comparison
to earlier years a steady growth of 1.5 to 2 per cent
a year would mark a signiﬁcant change.What has also begun to change is the politicalsystem dominated for most of the post-war years
by factions of the Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP). In the past, policy conﬂicts were fought

out within the LDP by the most powerful factions,the prime minister was usually a front man of shortduration and disposable. Junichiro Koizumi is the
ﬁrst ‘modern’ leader who has courted the people
and made good use of the media, a personable andstriking ﬁgure with his coif of hair, youthful in hissixties compared with his tired predecessors, andnicknamed ‘Lionheart’. His notable achievement
when he ﬁrst became party leader and so prime
minister in 2001 was to face down the factions and
to rely for his political power on ‘people power’and the electoral system. He promised deepreforms of the economy, privatisation, competi-

tion of business at home, reform of the banking
sector and an end of the wasteful corruption and
public spending. But the Japanese people are
afraid of change and the inevitable loss of securityit entails, deploring rising unemployment andfearful of restructuring. In the domestic economy
only comparatively small progress was achieved,
while efﬁcient big business which exports to the
world did not wait on government reforms tomaintain its competitiveness.Koizumi’s popularity was put to the test in theNovember 2003 elections to the lower house.
Despite fears of his promised ‘structural reforms’,
the LDP remained the largest single party withhalf of the 480 seats. But another new feature hasbeen the emergence of the Democratic Party of
Japan (DPJ) as a credible opposition party. The
gain is the evolution of a two-party system
strengthening democratic choice. Koizumi’s
other aim is to shed Japan’s subservient inter-national paciﬁsm in the face of North Korea’s mil-itary threat – North Korea not only has developed
nuclear weapons which Japan has forsworn, but
missiles which it demonstrated could reach Japan.
A symbolic step of his new thinking was to deploya small force of troops of the self-defence forcesoutside Japan in southern Iraq. The signs are that
Koizumi will not be another in a long line of
short-lived prime ministers.South Korea, once Japan’s follower in eco-
nomic development, contrasts with Japan in hav-
ing undertaken radical reform to restructure itseconomy with spectacular success. After the dip in
2003, the economy is growing strongly dominated
by restructured efﬁcient big business, the 
chaebols.But politics are more tumultuous. After one year inofﬁce the opposition parties impeached PresidentRoh Moo Hyun on the ﬂimsiest of pretexts in

March 2004, a gambit that backﬁred when in the

national elections the following month his Uri946GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
Party was returned with an increased majority.With a four-year term and a working majority Rohis in a position to push through promised reforms
but so far has lacked the determination and steadi-

ness to achieve much. For South Korea the night-

mare remains – the militarised North which theSouth has tried to placate with aid. Possibly even inthe North in 2004 tiny shoots of change have
begun to sprout to bring the country out of its iso-

lation. North Korea’s nuclear plans create the most
uncertainty and tension in the region.Philippine democracy is in a parlous state. Thepeople’s choice of president has, in the past,proved unfortunate. President Gloria Arroyo’s
qualifications as a sound economist seem less
important than the handsome media image of the
best known B-ﬁlm actor, a Mr Poe, totally inex-perienced in politics. Memories of the impeachedpredecessor of President Arroyo were enough,
however, for the majority to vote for her. The
better news in 2004 is that a peace deal might be
done with the Muslim separatists on the island ofMinndanao and their assurance that their linkswith al-Qaeda will be severed.Voting for changes of government in elections,however imperfect the process, has become the
norm in Asia except in China and North Korea
and in Pakistan, which has more a tradition of mil-itary rulers than democratic elected ones, as well asin Myanmar. Indonesia went to the polls in April
2004 with President Megawati Sukarnoputri, the
daughter of the nation’s founding father, hoping
to maintain her position. The Bali bombing in2002 demonstrated that Islamic terrorists areactive. Despite the economic recovery bringing
Indonesia back from the brink, she is blamed for a
lack of determination to stamp out corruption.
Elections in 2004 voted her out of ofﬁce.In Malaysia there have been no great changessince Mahathir’s retirement. The once-populardeputy premier Anwar Ibrahim remains in prison.
Here there are more elections and calls for an end
of corruption, inevitable when one party and one
leader holds power for two decades as Mahathirdid. With the rest of Asia, Malaysia’s economy toohas recovered.The two most important countries of southernAsia, India and Pakistan are moving towardpeaceful coexistence, working for a compromiseon Kashmir after coming close to war at the closeof the twentieth century. The declaration in 2004
of the President of Pakistan, General Pervez
Musharraf, that he would not permit any territory
of Pakistan to become a home for terrorism brokethe stalemate. The danger of a conﬂict escalatingto a nuclear exchange drew the political leader-
ships on both sides back from the brink. Nuclear
weapons cast a black shadow over the world but
the hope must be that Alfred Nobel’s dream that
the destructive capacity of mankind would be sogreat that there would be no alternative to peacewill be realised. Dynamite and the weapons of
two world wars were not sufﬁcient to deter, but
no two countries possessing nuclear weapons have
ever fought each other.Alliances and friendships internationally arebased less on what countries have in common
than in identifying common enemies. When the
president General Musharraf seized power in
1999 he first backed the Taliban regime inAfghanistan but then changed sides two yearslater and became America’s ally. This earned him
the enmity of Muslim radicals of the Pushtun
minority he had earlier supported. But he struck
a deal with moderate Islamists that would enable
him to remain president until 2007. With thebacking of the army and adroit politics, whichenabled him to persuade parliament to allow a
military-dominated National Security Council to
be created, he will remain in power unless assas-
sinated by an extremist. Internationally, with itssuccessful nuclear weapons programme and thesecret spread of nuclear technology to Libya, Iran,
Malaysia and to North Korea in return for North
Korean missile technology, Pakistan should have
been branded a ‘rogue state’. But as an essential
US ally in the ‘war against terrorism’, hunting binLaden, no sanctions will be inﬂicted, nor will thehuman-rights records be challenged by the West.
Common enemies make for strange bedfellows.India began its marathon elections in thespring of 2004. The Congress Party, which pre-viously ruled India, has made a comeback with ayoung Ghandi generation set to revive its for-
tunes. Hindu extremism has marred the otherwise
successful coalition government led by the Hindu1INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM947
nationalist BJP. India’s prime minister Atal BehariVajpayee has presided over an economic boom in2003 and 2004 that has beneﬁted 300 million
urban middle-class Indians. But India has two
faces. Rural India lacks electric power, adequate
roads, medical and social services and the majorityliving in the countryside have secured little bene-ﬁt from the boom that is raising living standards
for others. In a result that surprised the pundits,
Sonya Ghandi, wife of the assassinated Congress
prime minister Rajiv Ghandi, won the elections
then unexpectedly withdrew leaving the premier-ship to Manmohan Singh. Congress won throughsupport of the rural power who did not beneﬁt
from the growing prosperity of the urban middle
class. India’s population growth still outstrips the
creation of new employment and foreign invest-ment; though this has increased strongly compar-ed with the earlier years of stiﬂing planning, it is
only a fraction of investments ﬂowing into China.
Still there is in the twenty-ﬁrst century hope where
there was little before the last ten years.The same cannot be said of India’s neighbourMyanmar where the ruling military have no inten-
tion of relinquishing power to Aung Sun Kyi the
popular dissident leader of the repressed National
League for Democracy. It will not be given the
opportunity to repeat its overwhelming success inthe 1990 elections and has suffered various formsof restraint and arrest ever since. Even so, in Asia
the rulers are beginning to win more acceptance.Afghanistan on Pakistan’s border has remaineddivided into warlord ﬁefs. The ravages of twenty-three years of conﬂict cannot be quickly repaired.The leader Hamid Karzai has persuaded Afghan
representatives to approve a new constitution for
an Islamic republic. It looked ﬁne on paper but
expressed aspirations rather than reality. The
national army is too weak to control the country,the US forces are essential to bolster some securityand, for the poverty-stricken Afghans, opium pop-
pies are the most reliable cash crop. But the ﬁrst
democratic elections in October 2004, though
flawed, showed that the Afghan people were keen to go to the polls, including, for the ﬁrsttime, women. Karzai, the interim leader, was
elected president. Progress has been achieved.
Afghanistan requires massive foreign aid, notenough will be provided as the Western focus hasshifted to the Middle East. Since the end of theCold War Latin America too is no longer, in
Western eyes, a crucial region and battleground.The principal Western interest in Latin America isﬁnancial and trade based. The long-term aim ofthe US is to create an inter-American free trade
area. But fears and suspicion of US dominance
remain an obstacle. Instead, larger trading blocs
have been created among Latin American states,
such as Mercosur and the Central American FreeTrade Area, which may eventually act as steppingstones to a continental-wide free trade area. In
South America, Chile is the only country to have
a free trade agreement with the US. In the north,
Mexico and Canada remain closely linked in theNorth American Free Trade Area (NAFTA). Morethan four-ﬁfths of Canadian exports go to the US.Radical change in Canadian politics after theretirement in December 2003 of Jean Chrétien is
not on the cards. Jean Chrétien’s governmentbrought Canada a decade of growth and prosper-ity. His long-time ﬁnance minister Paul Martin,
leading the Liberal Party, became his successor.
He has proved disappointingly lacklustre. The
Quebec issue is dead for the foreseeable future. Mexico has not undergone the radical changeexpected after ending PRI’s monopoly of powerin the 2000 elections. The PRI was able to win
back seats which enabled it to block the reforms
President Vicente Fox would like to legislate. By
2005, with his term of ofﬁce drawing to an end,domestically he is unlikely to achieve much.Meanwhile, the president is anxious to maintain
good relations with the Bush administration
which received a setback when, despite heavy
arm-twisting, Mexico was not willing to back
Washington and London’s efforts at the UN tosecure a second Iraq resolution unequivocally jus-tifying the invasion. The increasing importance of
the Hispanic vote in US elections helps to smooth
relations between the US and Latin America.
Bush’s efforts to legalise the Mexican immigrantsappeals to the Hispanic voters and improves rela-tions with Mexico. There is plenty to rufﬂe them
still as Latin American politics in Brazil and
Venezuela capitalise on anti-American feelings.948GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
Brazil is the giant among the Latin Americanstates with a population (179 million) almost ﬁvetimes as large as Argentina’s (39 million) and 
an economy more than three times the size.
President Luis Inàcio Lula da Silva, promising a
new fair deal, was brought to power by the poor.His left-wing credentials have not made him anobvious partner of the US which, through the
International Monetary Fund, can exercise ﬁnan-
cial muscle to facilitate or obstruct loans. Nor is
Lula da Silva an obvious disciple of IMF remedies
– cutting government deﬁcits, responsible ﬁnanceand freeing trade and competition. Nevertheless,in his ﬁrst two years of power the president began
to tackle Brazil’s ills; the need to bring down
inﬂation and to curb proﬂigacy by imposing high
interest rates. Better credit rating and a weakercurrency have boosted Brazil’s exports. None ofthis has immediately helped the poor, one in eight
are unemployed. The rewards lie in the future as
the economy resumes growth and investor conﬁ-
dence returns. Inevitably, the president’s popu-larity plummeted.Argentina could hardly fall lower than it did in2001. President Néstar Kirchner gained popular-
ity in threatening not to repay Argentina’s private
creditors and the IMF at the expense of bank-
rupt Argentineans. But wiser counsels prevailed.Agreement was reached with the IMF in 2004and a new loan secured and negotiations contin-
ued with private investors. Fortunately, the
economy grew strongly in 2003 and 2004 and,
with a determined president willing to reform, thefuture began to look much brighter.Chile is the one South American state that isclose to the US. The country continued to be
ruled by the centre-left after the fall of Pinochet
in 1990. Though human rights are secure, demo-
cratic parliamentary rule suffers from the lack ofa credible opposition.The two most turbulent countries of thesouthern hemisphere were Venezuela and Haiti.
President Hugo Chavez’s Bolívarian revolution
resulted in catastrophic strikes and opposition anda campaign to oust him by democratic means.From a low base Venezuela’s economy has begun
to recover and Chavez in 2004 convincingly won
a referendum conﬁrming him in the presidency.In Haiti in 2004 Jean-Bertrand Aristide wasousted from power by a violent rebellion. A UNforce with US and allied troops restored order,
but the roots of violence and the abject poverty
of the mass of population remain even when the
troops depart.So what is happening in Latin America? Hasthe new century broken the mould of the old? In
one way it appears to have done so, elections and
democracy are the norm; the rise of commodity
prices fuelled by China and the world recovery
have lifted the economies from the abyss. But thevery dependence on commodities makes LatinAmerica vulnerable to the next downturn. Bust
may follow boom again. The overwhelming
majority of the people live in poverty which pro-
vides no stable foundation for democracy as des-perate people turn to charismatic leaders who, inturn, stimulate repression of rights. Latin America
depends on the judgement of private investors
and the willingness of the US to risk the funds of
the International Monetary Fund. The massiveaid needed is not forthcoming. Below the surfacethe new century marks more continuity than
change. The real lift-off lies in the future.No continent’s misery has been greater than thatof Africa or, more accurately, sub-Saharan Africawhich comprises most of the continent and itspeople. Somalia has been practically left to ﬁght

out its own warlord wars. Robert Mugabe in
Zimbabwe has made a mockery of democratic rule
and civil rights. Distributing the estates of thewhite farmers to some 134,000 black Zimbab-
weans without adequate training has reduced
Zimbabwe from an exporting country to one
dependent on foreign aid to stave off famine. In
acting as he did, encouraging violence against the
white population, he completely reversed the rolehe played when ﬁrst coming to power. Zimbabwe
has been suspended from the Commonwealth, but
enjoys the protection of South Africa’s president,
Thabo Mbeki. Without more aid millions of
Zimbabweans face starvation which may forceMugabe to moderate or even hand over power.Brave Zimbabweans who formed the Movement
for Democratic Reform, a dwindling group who
are beaten up and persecuted, continue to chal-

lenge Mugabe. The ﬁrst treason trial in October
2004 of their leader Morgan Tsuangirai collapsed;his conviction on ﬂimsy evidence Mugabe proba-

bly had decided would unnecessarily outrage inter-

national opinion and create a martyr; Tsuangirai
faced another trial. Mugabe’s control is so com-
plete that he probably decided the Movement forDemocratic Reform no longer was a threat to him.
Zimbabwe can hardly sink lower, there remains
only the hope that when Mugabe goes, the
stricken country can begin to recover. The vast
Congo is not under the complete control ofKinshara and rebels hold sway in the east on theborders of Uganda. War, disease and poverty, by
the end of 2005, will have killed 4 million, half of
them children.Every year hope is renewed that the ArabMuslim north of Sudan will reach a settlementwith the rebellion of mainly black Christians and
animists in the south but the conﬂict has contin-
ued. Peace can come none too soon after forty
years of war and 2 million dead victims. It hascome tantalisingly near with the help of the UN.In 2004 a new rebellion broke out in western
Sudan in the Darfur province bordering on Libya
and Chad with over one million peasants ﬂeeing
the ﬁghting. Arab militias backed by the govern-
ment burnt their villages, terrified the blackAfrican Sudanese, murdering 50,000. Aid agen-cies struggle with inadequate resources in the
refugee camps in Chad where thousands have
died from disease and malnutrition while the UN
threatens sanctions, diplomats talk, and nocountry wishes to intervene seriously. These areall major catastrophes against which the casualties
in Iraq pale, but they are in regions less import-
ant to the powerful nations of the world.Against the wars that persist, the threat of thedevastation wrought by AIDS looms even larger.In Africa as a whole the infection rate had notlessened by 2005. More than 25 million are
estimated to be HIV positive. In the worst
affected countries a third of the adults carry HIV
and in Botswana it is nearly 40 per cent. Wars andmigrant labour have spread disease, and povertyand lack of health care have led to early death,
especially of the young productive population. In
Malawi, for instance, there is only one doctor forevery 50,000 people and only one dollar is allo-cated for health spending on each person. Cleanwater and sanitation are lacking. AIDS is the
biggest threat to Africa’s future; tuberculosis,
malaria and malnutrition still unnecessarily claim
lives. For the past few years President Mbeki hasbeen in denial about the true cause of AIDS anddrugs have only recently been made available on
a wider scale. In standards of living for the major-
ity of the people Africa has gone backwards. The
last two decades have been catastrophic for much
of the continent. Is, then, everything gloomy?There is also better news from the continent’smost populous countries south of the Sahara,
South Africa and Nigeria. As South Africa moves
into the new millennium Thabo Mbeki was
elected in democratic elections to a second termas president. Who would have forecast that racialharmony would follow the oppressive decades 
of white rule? It is a remarkable achievement,
Mandela’s legacy. Huge challenges remain, reduc-
tion of unemployment and the need for bettereducational opportunities and social care to stopthe decline of living standards among the poor.
The white South Africans are largely responsible
for economic growth though a black middle class
is increasing. With the blessings of internal peace
South Africa’s future begins to look brighter.In Nigeria democratic rule was re-establishedand the cultural and ethnic rifts had been con-
tained by President Olusegum Obasanjo, elected
for a second term. The rise in the price of oil has
beneﬁted the economy but not the poor major-ity. Much needs to be done to root out corrup-tion and persevere with reforms. Corruption has
blighted Nigeria for decades, the oil riches reach-
ing the few at the expense of the many. Oil too
should have lifted Angola, now at peace, out of
the devastation of decades of civil war, but againcorrupt dealings by the few remain a barrier toimproving standards of living. The West may help
to raise Africa out of the depths with aid, more
importantly by reforming its own farming subsi-
dies, but in the end it will be up to African leadersand African enterprise to fashion a better future.During the last decade of the twentieth centuryattention in Europe was focused on the wars in950GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
Yugoslavia. Now there is peace, not perfect har-mony. In 2004, Kosovo and ﬂared into violenceto oust Serbian remnants there, NATO peace-
keepers continued to ensure stability in Bosnia.
The 17,000 strong force in December 2004 was
taken under the command of the EU after adecade of peace keeping. Serbia post-Milos
ˇevic´has not moved forward and is politically unstable,
and relations with the West are soured over the
one-sided war crimes trials they perceive. But
nowhere in Europe in the new millennium is there
war. The one war in which a European country isengaged is Russia’s conﬂict in Chechnya. Putin had declared it to be over but in realitypeace has not come to Chechnya and Chechnyan
militants have staged spectacular terrorist attacks
in the heart of Moscow in revenge. The conﬂictspread to the Caucasus. Apart from ChechnyaRussia has changed remarkably under the strong
lead of President Putin. Putin’s handling won him
popular support and a second presidential term
in March 2004 against weak opponents. Theimprisonment of the Yukos oil magnet MikhailKhordorkovsky and control of the media show
that he will allow no rival power basis and in the
Duma Putin’s United Russia Party had won
control in elections in December 2003. The world
was reminded of the brutal struggle in Chechnyawhen terrorists occupied a school massacringchildren and teachers. In the aftermath Putin
tightened his hold on Russia by insisting on far-
reaching constitutional changes: members of the
Duma will be elected from party lists and notdirectly from constituencies and the eighty-nineregional governors will no longer be elected either
but appointed by the Kremlin. With the rise in
the price of oil and better budgetary controls the
economy has recovered and stabilised. Relations
with the West are good, and many contentiousissues lie in the past, peace is essential if Russiais to continue to progress. Events in the Ukraine in November 2004showed that differences, west and east, had not
been totally overcome and could suddenly cloudrelations. The Ukraine is a country with a popu-lation of more than 35 million, geographically
and culturally split between the west and east; the
west looking to the EU and the east to contin-uing close ties with Russia. The elections for thepresidency underlined this division with Putinbacking the pro-Russian candidate against the
opposition. To ensure the victory of the pro-
Russian candidate there was massive electoral
fraud and he was declared the winner. People tookto the streets in Kiev; people power prevailed onceagain. Compromise and unity are the most likely
outcome after new elections; the opposition can-
didate won the rerun elections in January 2005.There is a long way to go to overcome Russia’shealth problems, security with peace in Chechnya,ending the corruption, strengthening businesslaw, and lifting all of the people out of poverty.
Russia, though its democracy is ﬂawed by Western
standards, requires strong leadership and is
moving in the right direction. For the great major-ity of Russian people decent standards of living,security and civil liberty are more immediately
important than democracy.The continental European countries are all strug-gling to maintain the expensive burdens of awelfare state, the prospect of having to fund the
pensions of an ageing population, and unem-

ployment at around 9 per cent is too high in
France, Germany and Italy and even higher in
Spain. To regain more robust growth painfulchanges are needed. Britain stands out among thebigger European countries with low unemploy-
ment and reasonable growth. The policies of the
centre-right government in President Chirac’s
France, Schröder’s social democratic Germany,right-wing Berlesconi’s government in Italy andthe new socialist government of José Zapatero in
Spain do not differ that much, nor do the chal-
lenges facing them. In foreign relations they had parted companyfrom Blair’s Labour Britain which had backedBush’s policy in Iraq and shared its aims. In 2004Blair’s reputation suffered from the difﬁculties 
the coalition ran into in Iraq and from the loss of
credibility for going to war in the ﬁrst place when
no weapons of mass destruction were found orbelieved to have existed after the ﬁrst Gulf War.Overcloser union with Europe the majority of the

British electorate remained sceptical and Blair’s
belated conversion to allowing the electorate a say1INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM951
in a referendum was a further blow to the beliefwhich had sustained him: that he was not likeother politicians. Need for a referendum was the
one issue on which the Conservatives would have
enjoyed overwhelming support in a general elec-
tion, and it was now snatched from them. Itlooked more like a cynical political manoeuvrethan a genuine change of heart. Blair survived and
Labour remained well ahead of the Conservatives
as the next general election loomed. Tensions
became more evident between Chancellor Brown
and the prime minister as Blair embraced the‘New Labour’ policies once more for an expectedthird term, thwarting the more left-inclined
Gordon Brown. The Conservatives, meanwhile,
had found an effective parliamentary leader in
Michael Howard. Their problem was to ﬁnd acause, another mission, as Blair straddled thecentre ground of policies.For Europe the culminating achievement inthe new millennium has been its coming together
into a peaceful partnership – the European Union.The divisions of Yalta, which left central andEastern Europe in Soviet control against their will,
have ended. The enmities of the Second World
War ﬁnally lie buried. There is no more amicable
and close partnership than that between Germany
and France, overriding political differences.On 1 May 2004 eight continental Europeancountries and two islands in the Mediterranean
joined the Union. The largest and most import-
ant new member was Poland with a population
(38.2 million) almost as large as Spain’s. With afailing government and a large farming popula-tion, joining will cause painful adjustments. None
of the countries that join enjoy the full beneﬁts
of subsidies from the start or are completely free
to seek employment in the West before 2007.
There is particular anxiety that persecuted minori-ties, such as the Roma in Slovakia, will embark on mass migrations. Even though growth has
resumed, all the new members except Slovenia
will take decades to reach the living standards of
the more prosperous West.The economics of all the new ten members –Slovakia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,
Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Cyprus and
Malta, however, are growing faster than the stag-nant continental Western countries. The free trademarket has become the largest in the world. Itseems inevitable that the twenty-ﬁve members will
group themselves into different blocs within the
EU. None of the new members, for instance, will
join the Monetary Union in the immediate future.With a new decision procedure in the EU still tobe worked out so that policy is not paralysed, new
alignments will be formed. The draft constitution
will require ratiﬁcation and some ten members,
including Britain, will submit the decision to a 
referendum. If one member state or more fails toratify, the EU faces a new crisis. The new presidentof the commission José Manuel Barroso also faced
the embarrassment, in November 2004, of having
to withdraw the line up of his new commissioners,
anticipating a European parliamentary rejection.Dropping two commissioners and realigning therest won approval, but it was a signiﬁcant victory
for parliamentary power. Intractable differences
have occurred before during the half century of
the community’s existence and ways have always,in the past, been found to overcome them. When on 1 May 2004 all the ten new memberscelebrated their entry, there was one sour note. It
was hoped that all the people on the divided
island of Cyprus would agree to the UN-brokered
peace plan to unify the government. The Turkssaid yes to the proposed settlement, the GreekCypriots said no. They felt they had little to lose
as the Greek Cypriot part of the island had been
promised membership anyway.Not all of Europe is united yet. Bosnia remainsunder the control of an EU peacekeeping force;Serbian politics are turbulent and popular resis-
tance to compliance to hand over the chief per-
petrators of war crimes to The Hague court has
impeded relations with the West. Milos
ˇevic´who
was sent to The Hague has inspired defiancerather than compliance. Bulgaria and Romania arenot yet considered to be far enough on the road
to reform and adjustment to become members
and have been set a target date of 2007. But
looking at the wider picture the transformation ofcentral and northern Europe has been astonish-ing. The brutal communist dictatorships, secret
police, the dead hand of state control, bureau-
cracy, class discrimination, and party regimenta-952GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
tion have been swept away. Civic freedom anddemocratic government, the basic requirementsof membership, are being anchored in. Even with
all the difﬁculties ahead still to be overcome, who
can doubt that this is a better world for the
people of Europe?The largest applicant of all, Turkey, with a pop-ulation of almost 70 million, is keen to join but
arouses the most contention within the EU.
Ninety-eight of every hundred people living in
Turkey are Muslims. Can a Muslim country be
regarded as ‘European’? Should Europe remain aunion of overwhelmingly Christian countries?That is the view of the former French president
Giscard d’Estaing who chaired the committee
drafting the proposed constitution. The centre-
left government of Gerhard Schröder, however, isin favour. In this it differs from France’s right.With Muslim problems at home, President Chirac
is more ambivalent. In ‘principle’ the EU is com-
mitted to admitting Turkey when all the condi-
tions are fulfilled. Turkey is governed by amoderate Islamic party. Prime Minister RecepTayyip Erdogan has legislated many reforms to
meet EU standards. There are three major obsta-
cles to be overcome. The economy is weak and
unstable and the country is far poorer than the
existing members; question marks over the dura-bility of Turkish democracy linger; so as not toimpede the entry progress, the once all-powerful
army command has held back but continues to see
itself as the guardian of the Ataturk legacy; the
relationship with the Kurdish minority has easedwith a lessening of their harsh treatment but is notcompletely solved. One big step forward was
Turkey’s pressure on the Turkish Cypriot leaders
to accept the UN plan even though it failed due to
the Greek Cypriot no vote. The Greek mainland
government acknowledged Turkey’s new stanceand, once the most determined opponents toTurkey’s entry, have declared they will support 
it. Turkey’s possible membership still lies some
years in the future. A democratic, Muslim, secular
Turkey, would help to change any Muslim per-ceptions in the Middle East and beyond that a‘clash’ between a Christian West and the Muslim
world exists. A new pattern in global relations is
emerging in the twenty-ﬁrst century.There are increasing global interrelations, goodand bad, such as trade liberalisation throughnegotiations at the World Trade Organisation,
efforts to save the environment, the depletion of
world resources in the sea and on land, refugees,
human rights and the limitation of nuclearweapons and weapons of mass destruction. Moreglobal issues are dealt with by speciﬁc organisa-
tions and through UN agencies. Agreements are
hammered out reconciling national interests.
Peacekeeping, too, is an international concern but
international action through the UN is depend-ent on none of the countries holding a vetoblocking it. Then individual countries will act on
their own or with partners even when they cannot
secure UN backing – the Kosovo war and the war
against Iraq are recent instances. No country willaccept being blocked by disagreement on theSecurity Council if it believes rightly or wrongly
that its vital national interests are at stake. That is
a reality in an imperfect world. KoﬁAnnan, the

secretary-general of the UN has grasped the dif-ﬁcult nettle of reform. There is no African per-manent member on the Security Council; neither
India nor Japan have permanent representation,
yet two European countries, Britain and France
each have veto powers; Germany, much larger
than either, has no voice. The distribution ofpower dates back to the end of the Second WorldWar and no longer reflects the world half a
century later. That weakens the authority of the
UN, already undermined by Iraq, where the US
and Britain led a war declared illegal by KoﬁAnnan. But Kofi Annan’s own standing has suffered from the massive frauds of the oil for
humanitarian assistance to Iraq programme over-
seen by the UN, which enabled Saddam Hussein
to skim-off millions to bribe and corrupt foreign
‘friends’ of his regime.Countries will take the lead in sending troops toregions of traditional concern or for humanitarian
reasons later securing UN backing or acting for the
UN. Britain undertook intervention in Sierra
Leone, the US in Grenada, Haiti, Panama andLiberia. But countries will also simply be left toﬁght out each other’s conﬂicts, as during the wars

between India and Pakistan, at best they will be
offered diplomatic mediation. Nor is there any1INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM953
keenness to send troops to countries whose rulersperpetrate human catastrophes on their ownpeople. The example of Rwanda was repeated in
Darfur, western Sudan in 2004. There are no uni-

versal peacekeepers even though there is one coun-

try, the US, more powerful than all the others.The US neither has the resources nor is itwilling to sacriﬁce young men and women to act
as policemen everywhere in the world. So a
pattern is gradually becoming clearer that harks
back to the close of the Second World War. The
idea of the regional policemen, then, was thatChina, Britain, the US and Russia would each beresponsible for peace in their own parts of the
world. Half a century later the ‘regional police-
men’ are more numerous. Russia still controls a
vast land of different peoples and cultures, NATOhas replaced Britain and links Europe and the US,the European Union is emerging with its own
rapid reaction force, but China is reluctant to act
as a policeman outside its borders; it has enough
problems at home. African countries cannot do soeven if they want to unless given ﬁnancial andlogistical support. ‘Ethical’ or ‘moral’ foreign
policies have not dominated international action
and are unlikely to do so in the future.In the sub-Sahara, South Africa is anotherreluctant participant; in West Africa, Nigeria hasled a West African joint effort as it did from 1990to 1997 in Liberia and again in 2003. The West
African force, too, lacks resources but on occasion
the US will provide a logistics and ﬁnancial back-
up while rejecting a leading role. There are no setpatterns in some regions of the world where noforce of ‘regional policemen’ can be formed
because they are too divided. If at the same time
it is a region of vital interest to one or more of
the powerful countries of the world the outcome
is even more difﬁcult to predict. The most volatilearea fitting this characterisation is the MiddleEast. The international vacuum is partially ﬁlled
in the Middle East by the US and partners willing
to act with it. But much will depend on the out-
come of the US-led intervention in Iraq wherethe peaceful evolution of some form of demo-cratic government is threatened by the resistance
of militant Sunnis. In the new millennium the
hope is for the peaceful resolutions of conﬂictsand regional actions in line with the ideals of theUnited Nations. Inevitably realities will frequentlyfall short of high ethical purposes.The dangers to peace have radically changed.The shadow of nuclear holocaust between the
Soviet Union and the West has been lifted. Today technological weapon advances allow smallgroups of terrorists to inﬂict injury to every coun-
try on the globe. It will always be possible to
inspire groups to identify hated enemies and to
brainwash individuals to accept that any means are
justiﬁed to hit the targeted enemy. Martyrdom fora cause has become more widespread, born out offrustration and hatred from Chechnya to Israel,
New York to Nairobi. Al-Qaeda has been the
focus of the war against terror. In fact, hundreds
of groups act on their own or in loose touch witheach other. It is not a war that has a deﬁnite startdate or will end on a day with a surrender. It is 
a continuous struggle on two fronts – to try 
to remove the causes where there is a will to do so
and to strike against terrorists to reduce theirdestructiveness. The struggle with terrorists andtheir ‘successes’ makes headlines but the direct
loss of life has run into thousands over a decade
not comparable to the wars of the twentieth cen-
tury with the deaths of millions. The nightmare
scenario of the future is that a terror group couldobtain nuclear or biological weapons of massdestruction. A foretaste was the attack by one
group with nerve gas in the Tokyo subway or
Saddam’s use of killer gas against the Kurds. For
several years before 2003 a Pakistani scientistAbdul Khan, through a network of agents, dis-tributed nuclear know-how and even components
to build a bomb to Iran, North Korea and Libya,
and other countries as well. More immediate is the
danger from a nuclear ‘dirty bomb’ far easier to
construct. Striking successfully against terrorists in hiding protected by sections of the local popu-lation has always proved to be extraordinarily haz-
ardous and difﬁcult. Such conﬂicts all over the
world can continue for decades. When leaders of
countries support them, the blunt instrument ofwar as in Afghanistan can hinder the terrorists’ability to strike but not to inspire others. Sanctions
are another weapon which in the end proved
effective in Libya.954GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
It is justiﬁable to end a history of the world withmore positive reﬂections. During the century thatnow lies behind, wars and tyrannical regimes
resulted in the deaths of at least 200 million
people, most of them civilians, and even more
millions suffered injury and loss. The century that
saw so much material progress for the survivors
was a graveyard for others.The threat to life has been reduced to a frac-tion of the cataclysmic total of the twentieth
century. Europe, in the past a cauldron of wars,
is peacefully coming together for common pur-
poses. Russia has ceased to be a threat and, in
turn, has ceased to feel threatened by the West.The alliance of NATO against the Soviet Unionhas been transformed into an association with it.
The Balkan ﬁres have been smothered.There are dangers in Asia. India and Pakistan,both nuclear powers, are still unable to settle their
Kashmir dispute, but the nuclear stand-off, like 
a mini-Cold War situation of mutual assured
destruction, makes their leaders draw back from
the brink. Their economies are growing though
many obstacles to more rapid development
persist. Perhaps the most unexpected change has
been the global integration of China just a decade
and a half after the brutal Tiananmen suppression.The Chinese people enjoy more freedoms, as longas they accept the control of the one-party com-
munist leadership. The most severe curtailment of
personal freedom was the draconian one child per
couple policy to limit population growth. Its
success is leading to relaxation. The Chinese army
is the regime’s safeguard of internal control and
is not intended as a means of external aggression.
Bitter ideological differences with Taiwan have
been papered over internationally and the war of
words has remained just that.The Japanese people who, alone, have sufferedthe devastation of a nuclear attack, like theGermans, have purged themselves of ambitions ofwar and aggression. Though their economy has
stagnated for a decade, Japan remains by far the
wealthiest and most powerful economy in Asia, an
important partner of global economic health. The
superiority of a market economy over rigid com-
munist state control, of representative institutionsover tyranny, is demonstrated by the contrastbetween South Korea and North Korea. NorthKorea, with a nuclear programme and a million-
strong army, is a threat, but the North Korean
regime is isolated, economically a disaster, and
desperately needs Western help and relief: a
‘rogue state’ that is being, and has to be, con-
tained. Tyrannical regimes have become the
exception and are no longer spreading like cancer
across the globe. The benefits of the market
economy and governments accountable to the
people are becoming dominant. Possibly it is a
hopeful pointer to a better future globally that
some conflicts which only a short while agoseemed incapable of any resolution have ended ina truce in regions widely apart. The fighting
between the Sri Lankan government and the
Tamil Tigers ended in 2002, the IRA ceased 
its bombing and violence in Northern Ireland 
in 1994, and the conﬂict between Taiwan and 
the People’s Republic of China remains a war of
words; in the Sudan the Muslim government in
the north ended the war in the south by negoti-
ation with the help of the UN.The fears that population growth which passedthe six billion mark at the turn of the twenty-ﬁrst
century could outstrip the planet’s resources haveonce again been found to be misplaced. Althoughthe world’s population astonishingly doubled in
just the last forty years the increase has slowed.
There is, in the twenty-ﬁrst century, a growing
awareness of dangers ahead and the world leaders
are making efforts to meet them. Standards of
living are rising, though unevenly in different
regions; they are accelerating faster in the devel-
oped world with the gap between rich and poor
widening. That issue, too, is on the world agenda.This disparity, more than wars and persecutionhas led to the enterprising seeking better oppor-
tunities and a better life for themselves and theirfamilies. Opportunities for migration to the devel-oped world for those without means of skills in
demand are severely restricted. The poor coun-
tries suffer from the brain drain of, for instance,
the skilled and doctors and nurses they have
trained at home who ﬁll the gaps in developed
nations, but no one wants large numbers of1INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM955
unskilled. The only way in for the great majorityis to take advantage of international obligationsfor countries to accept people in danger of harm
in their own countries – these are the asylum
seekers. Large numbers apply annually to Western
European countries which are unwilling to absorb
them and try to distinguish between those gen-
uinely in danger and those who are not but are
seeking a better life, the so-called economic
migrants. Thousands of tragedies result daily.
Governments ﬁnd themselves under popular pres-
sure to limit entry though historically immigrants
have beneﬁted the countries they enter once they
have been able to establish themselves. The per-ception is that they cost the state money and useresources already inadequate for the indigenous
populations. Often of different race and culture,
they start as strangers who have to assimilate and
it is difﬁcult for many to accept those different to
themselves. The influx of migrants, whether
Mexican in California or Afghans in Britain, is a
major domestic issue. Actually in a global per-
spective the numbers are minuscule.Even adding illegal immigrants, the eightwealthy countries between them receive less than
400,000 applications, reject most and, with illegal
immigrants, probably absorb less than half amillion in a population of over 600 million.Medical advances are able to keep pace with dis-
eases, though remedies are not available every-
where. That lack, too, is slowly improving. Racial
discrimination has not ceased but has lessened
and is recognised for the evil it is.Has the world become a better place in the new century? The global response of generosity
to help the victims of the earthquake in the
Indian Ocean, which struck with especially dev-
astating force the Aceh province of Indonesia and
the Tamil region of Sri Lanka on 26 December
2004, showed that on occasions when the world’smedia are fully engaged, common feelings ofhumanity break through. The death toll on that
single day reached at least a quarter of a million
and millions more lost everything, perhaps just
one member of a family survived with tens of
thousands of children orphaned. Nature cannot
be tamed, but the death toll of man’s conﬂictsexceed many times those of nature and attract lessattention and response from the wealthy nations:the millions of dead in the civil wars of the
Congo, the millions in the southern Sudan, which
hopefully can make a UN brokered peace reached
in January 2005 work, while in the western
Darfur region more than a million have ﬂed and
tens of thousands have been killed and there is no
end in sight.There are too many conﬂicts in Africa, Asiaand the Middle East raging simultaneously for
any one nation, even the most powerful, the US
and allies, to engage simultaneously. The role of
the UN is dependent on the backing of itsmembers especially the permanent representativesof the Security Council. The UN has often shown
a readiness to agree on resolutions, to offer peace-
keeping international forces, on occasion to
impose sanctions, to act as mediators, to provide
humanitarian aid, all functions of great value, but
can rarely agree to intervene with military force.
Nations pursue their self-interests above common
global goals unless the global goals are perceived
as in their own interest. Nor can governments set
themselves against the popular will for the more
than a limited time even in more authoritarian
societies. There is no prospect for universal peace,but the possibility of warfare on a global scalebetween the most powerful nations of the world,
which caused such human and material ravages
during the course of the twentieth century, has
receded. Peace is the only option between nuclear
armed Russia, the US, China, and Europe, global
trade a necessity for their mutual prosperity.
Representative government based on the consent
of the people, however, remains far from univer-
sal. Europe is no longer the cauldron from whose
centre global wars have spread, but it is at peace,
bound by treaties requiring respect for human
values and backed by economic union and law.For peoples in the greater part of the world thefuture holds the promise of better times even in
the less developed and poorest regions. But there
is a long way to go before basic human rights are
enjoyed by all and poverty, disease and the mil-
lions of unnecessary deaths they cause no longer
blight the lives of those not fortunate enough to956GLOBAL CHANGE:FROM THE 20thTO THE 21stCENTURY
be born in better governed and more prosperouscountries, a long way to go before a meaningfulglobal community emerges.Millions the world over follow the teachings ofthe Catholic Church and were affected by the
death of the Pope, John Paul II in April 2005.
He had made a huge impact on their lives. What
is his legacy? John Paul II condemned artiﬁcial
birth control and the use of condoms to combat
the plagues of Aids; the priesthood remained celi-
bate and male; homosexuality continued to be
morally unacceptable; in all this he followed the
traditional teaching of the Church. Power was
centralised in the Vatican to ensure conformity todoctrine. John Paul II was revered for his moralstrength and clarity, his courage resisting com-munism in his native Poland, his outreach visit-ing every continent despite failing health, his con-demnation of centuries of persecution of the
Jews, his conciliation of other faiths sharing
common foundations. His death attracted pil-

grims in unprecedented numbers and marked the
end of an era.In a world far from perfect and scarred by manyconﬂicts the words of Nelson Mandela ring out
as a ﬁtting inspiration for the new century:No one is born hating another person becauseof the colour of his skin, or his background,or his religion. People must learn to hate, they can be taught to love for love comes more
naturally to the human heart than its opposite.1INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM957
This bibliography represents only a fraction of theimmense, rich and varied literature concernedwith the history of the world from the twentieth
to the twenty-ﬁrst century. On the whole I have
concentrated on books available in English –
either written in that language or in translation.(English has become something of a universal lan-guage but that does not mean of course that all
the most important works of scholarship are avail-
able in English.) It is fortunate that many books
have appeared in paperback and these are marked
with an asterisk. Hardcover editions of thosepaperbacks which are out of print are frequentlyavailable in libraries. In the ﬁrst instance I have
chosen books which provide an overview of large
subjects, as these are likely to be particularly
useful to the student and general reader. Themain difﬁculty is to know how many books ofdetailed scholarship additionally to cite. In com-
piling not too long a reading list, I have made
some pretty arbitrary judgements. The sugges-
tions made here should not, therefore, be
regarded as including all the more importantbooks. My aim has been a different one: toprovide a list of further reading which will intro-
duce the reader to some of the complexities and
controversies of interpretation which syntheses
tend to iron out. I should have liked to mentionall the books from which I have proﬁted, butunfortunately that is not practicable. This is not
so much a bibliography, then, as a useful starting
point for further study. (Quotations from the
papers of Neville Chamberlain are cited by per-mission of the University of Birmingham, andquotations from the unpublished Goebbels diariesare from the microﬁlm at Stanford University.)CONTENTSpage1General Histories959

SUGGESTIONS FORFURTHERREADING
1GENERAL HISTORIES
Two stimulating world histories are P. Johnson, ModernTimes: History of the World from 1920s to 1990s*, arevised edition of a book first published in 1983
(Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1997), and T. E. Vadney,
World since 1945: A Complete History of Global Change
from 1945 to the Present*, revised edn (Penguin, 1998),Older but still useful, D. C. Watt, F. Spencer and N.
Brown, A History of the World in the Twentieth Century,really three books in one, is a more detailed treat-
ment (Hodder & Stoughton, 1967). G. Barraclough
examines some underlying forces in An Introduction to Contemporary History(Penguin, 1969). The NewCambridge Modern Historyhad two shots at coveringthe twentieth century, a volume edited by D. Thomson,
The Era of Violence 1898–1945(Cambridge, 1960),which was incomplete for events after 1933, and C. L.
Mowat’s The Shifting Balance of World Forces,1898–1945(Cambridge, 1968). Both volumes containgood individual narrative chapters. Two French inter-
pretations are M. Crouzet, L’Epoque contemporaine: á la recherche d’une civilisation nouvelle(5th edn,Presses Universitaires, 1969); and a factual overview, J.
Bouillon, P. Sorlin and J. Rudel, Le Monde contempo-raine(13th edn, Bordas, 1968). For a good introduc-tion to the forces shaping culture and society, see 
M. Biddiss, The Age of the Masses* (Penguin, 1977). A. Best, J. M. Hanhimäki, J. A. Macolo, K. E. Schulze,
International History of the Twentieth Century
(Routledge, 2004). M. Howard and Wm. Roger Lewis
(eds), The Oxford History of the Twentieth Century*(Oxford University Press, 1998). Judith M. Brown and
Wm. Roger Lewis (eds), The Oxford History of theBritish Empire Vol. IV: The Twentieth Century(OxfordUniversity Press, 1999).EuropeJ. Joll, Europe since 1870* (Penguin, 1990) is outstand-ing; also excellent is H. S. Hughes, ContemporaryEurope: A History(4th edn, Prentice-Hall, 1976). Threevolumes of the Rise of Modern Europe series cover the
first half-century: O. J. Hale, The Great Illusion,1900–1914*, R. J. Sontag, A Broken World 1919–1939*;and G. Wright, The Ordeal of Total War, 1939–1945*(Harper & Row, 1971, 1971 and 1968), all well worth
reading.EasternAsia

O.Reischauer and A. M. Craig, Japan: Tradition andTransformation* (2nd edn, Unwin & Hyman, 1989).AfricaThe best one-volume history from origins to inde-pendence is J. D. Fage, A History of Africa* (2nd edn,Unwin Hyman, 1993).Latin AmericaB. Keen, A History of Latin America(vol. 2, 4th edn,Houghton Mifﬂin, 1992) provides an excellent survey
of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.The Middle EastTwo good general surveys are P. Mansﬁeld, The MiddleEast* (Penguin, 1992) and W. R. Polk, The Arab WorldToday* (4th edn, Harvard, 1991). A. H. Hourani, AHistory of the Arab Peoples* (Faber & Faber, 1991) andM. E. Yapp, The Near East since the First World War*(Longman, 1990) are also useful.The World EconomyFor a one-volume survey, see H. van der Wee, Prosperityand Upheaval: The World Economy 1945–1980*(Penguin, 1991). In the same series the ﬁrst half of the
century is covered in more detail by D. H. Aldcroft, TheEuropean Economy, 1914–2000(new edn, Routledge,2000). See also A. S. Milward, War, Economy andSociety, 1939–1945* (Methuen, 1987). An interestingtheory of modernisation and economic development is

Present* (2 vols, Macmillan, 1983) are of value.World International RelationsTwo good textbooks are available in paperback: thewell-tried P. Calvocoressi, World Politics since 1945*(7th edn, Longman, 1996) and W. R. Keylor, TheTwentieth Century World: An International History*(3nd edn, Oxford, 1996). These can be supplemented

(Methuen, 1987). Contemporary problems and their
origins are set out in G. Segal, The World AffairsCompanion* (new edn, Simon & Schuster, 1991).2SOME GENERAL NATIONAL HISTORIES
FranceFrom among the rich choice, A. Cobban, A History ofFrance, 1871–1961* (vol. 3, Penguin, 1961) remainsone of the best introductions. It may be supplemented1SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING959

including W. Carr, A History of Germany, 1815–1990*(4th edn, Arnold 1991) and Hajo Holborn, A History ofModern Germany(Knopf, 1969). G. Mann, The Historyof Germany since 1789* (Penguin, 1974) offers a per-sonal and stimulating view. A well-written survey paying
attention to the ‘moods’ of different periods is Gordon
A. Craig, Germany, 1866–1945(Oxford, 1978). Acritical analytical study is V. R. Berghahn, ModernGermany: Society, Economy and Politics in the Twentieth

Clark, Modern Italy, 1871–1982* (Longman,1985); and H. Hearder, Italy: A Short History*(Cambridge, 1990).BritainThere are some very good general histories; among 
the older, C. L. Mowat, Britain between the Wars*(Methuen, 1968) has stood the test of time well. For acomprehensive account, among the most reliable andperceptive is W. N. Medlicott, Contemporary England,1914–74* (Longman, 1976). A. J. P. Taylor, EnglishHistory, 1914–45* (Oxford, 1965) is stimulating. Agood recent account is T. O. Lloyd, Empire to WelfareState: English History, 1906–92* (4th edn, Oxford,1992); see also W. N. Medlicott, British Foreign Policysince Versailles, 1919–63* (2nd edn, Methuen, 1968).For brief and perceptive accounts, see D. Thomson,
England in the Twentieth Century* (Penguin, 1965)and H. Pelling, Modern Britain, 1885–1955(Nelson,1960). A fresh approach is offered in A. Marwick,
Britain in the Century of Total War* (Penguin, 1971),The best survey of Britain and her Commonwealth is 
W. D. McIntyre, The Commonwealth of Nations: Originsand Impact, 1869–1971(Minnesota, 1977). R. R.James, The British Revolution: British Politics, 1880–1939* (Methuen, 1978) is very good. For the periodbefore 1915 there is an outstandingly good paperback,
R. Shannon, The Crisis of Imperialism, 1865–1915*(Paladin, 1976). For post-1945 Britain there are two
excellent one-volume histories, K. O. Morgan, BritainSince 1945: The People’s Peace(Oxford University Press,2001) and A. Sked and C. Cook, Post-War Britain: APolitical History, 1945–1992* (4th edn, Penguin,1993).Tsarist Russia and the Soviet UnionA good recent survey is J. N. Westwood, Endurance andEndeavour: Russian History, 1812–1992* (Oxford, Forthe last decades of Tsarist Russia, see L. Kochan, Russiain Revolution* (Paladin, 1970). An invaluable analysisof Tsarist society is R. Pipes, Russia under the OldRegime* (Penguin, 1977). M. T. Florinsky, The End of the Russian Empire* (Collier-Macmillan, 1961); B.Dmytryshyn, USSR: A Concise History* (3rd edn,Scribner, 1978); and M. McAuley, Soviet Politics,1917–1991* (Oxford, 1992) are also useful. A good sur-vey that takes the collapse of the USSR into account is
G. Hosking, A History of the Soviet Union, 1917–1991*(HarperCollins, 1992). The history of the freed Baltic
nations can be studied in J. Hiden, The Baltic Nationsand Europe: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the
Twentieth Century* (Longman, 1991).Habsburg Empire and AustriaC. A. Macartney, The Habsburg Empire, 1790–1918(Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1969) is probably the best
general survey in any language. For a good study in
German, see E. Zöllner, Geschichte Österreichs(4th edn,Munich, 1970). See also A. J. P. Taylor, The HabsburgMonarchy, 1815–1918* (Penguin, 1964); A. J.

war-guilt began with F. Fischer, Griff nach derWeltmacht(Droste, 1961), translated as Germany’sAims in the First World War(Chatto & Windus, 1967).These ideas were supported and supplemented in V. R.
Berghahn’s excellent study, Germany and the Approachof War in 1914* (Macmillan, 1973). By far the bestbook on British policy is Z. Steiner, Britain and theOrigins of the First World War* (Macmillan, 1977). Forthe foreign policy of Austria-Hungary there is the well-
researched and sympathetic study by F. R. Bridge, FromSadowa to Sarajevo(Routledge, 1972). A good briefintroduction is L. C. F. Turner, Origins of the FirstWorld War* (Arnold, 1970); see also J. Röhl, Delusionor Design(Elek, 1973). For Serbian policies, see V.Dedijer, The Road to Sarajevo(MacGibbon & Kee,1967). For a French view, see P. Renouvin, La Criseeuropéenne et la Première Guerre Mondiale(4th edn,Presses Universitaires, 1962). The outstanding account
of British relations with Germany is P. Kennedy, The riseof the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860–1914(Allen &Unwin, 1980). The best general synthesis is J. Joll, TheOrigins of the First World War* (Longman, 1992). Seealso Niall Ferguson, Pity of War(New York, BasicBooks, 1999).MilitaryP. M. Kennedy (ed.), The War Plans of the Great Powers,1880–1914(Allen & Unwin, 1979); C. Falls, The GreatWar* (Putnam, 1961). An older study still useful for thewestern front is Basil Liddel Hart, History of the FirstWorld War*, ﬁrst published in 1930, also in paperback(Pan, 1972). For links between strategy and politics, see
L. L. Farrar, The Short War Illusion* (Clio, 1973) andM. Kitchen, The Silent Dictatorship(Croom Helm,1976). For the conﬂict between Russia, Germany and
Austria-Hungary, see N. Stone’s stimulating assessment
in The Eastern Front(Hodder & Stoughton, 1975). Seealso J. M. Bourne, Britain and the Great War, 1914–1918* (Arnold, 1989).General and DiplomaticM. Ferro, The Great War 1914–18* (Routledge, 1973);Z.

W. H. Chamberlin, The Russian Revolution, 1917–22*(2 vols, Grosset, 1965) was written close to the events it
describes, a vivid portrait ﬁrst published in 1935. See,

Deutscher, TheProphet Armed: Trotsky, 1879–1921* (Oxford, 1954)and The Prophet Unarmed: Trotsky, 1921–9* (Oxford,1970). E. H. Carr’s classic fourteen-volume History ofSoviet Russiais likely to be studied only by the special-ist; the ﬁrst three volumes have already been cited under
their sub-heading, The Bolshevik Revolution; E. H. Carrdistilled the multi-volume work into one very readable
volume to serve as a general introduction, entitled TheRussian Revolution: From Lenin to Stalin, 1917–29*(Macmillan, 1980). See also under national histories.
More recent works include E. Acton, Rethinking theRussian Revolution(Arnold, 1990); E. Mawdsley, TheRussian Civil War* (Allen & Unwin, 1987); and, fromthe doyen of American historians, R.

Among the best one-volume histories are P.Calvocoressi, G. Wint and J. Pritchard, Total War*(Penguin, 1995); R. A. C. Parker, Struggle for Survival:The History of the Second World War* (Oxford, 1990),an outstanding synthesis; M. Gilbert, Second World War(Collins, 1990); G. L. Weinberg, A World at Arms(Cambridge, 1994). W. S. Churchill, The Second WorldWar(6 vols, Cassell, 1948–54) is indispensable for a feel of the war as seen through Churchill’s eyes.
Indispensable, I.C.B. Dear and M.B.D. Foot. (eds) TheOxford Companion to the Second World War* (Oxford,2002). For a Soviet view, see P. N. Pospelov and others,
The Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, 1941–5
(Progress, 1974). The classic Western account is J.
Erickson, Stalin War with Germany(2 vols, Weidenfeld& Nicolson, 1975–83).Britain at war is also interestingly discussed by P. M.H. Bell, A Certain Eventuality(London, 1974) and in H. Pelling, Britain and the Second World War*(Fontana, 1970). A. Calder presents a vivid portrait in
The People’s War: Britain, 1939–45* (Panther, 1971).Also good is P. Addison, The Road to 1945* (Quartet,1977)R. Paxton, Vichy France(Barrie & Jenkins, 1972); A,S. Milward, The New Order and the French Economy(Oxford, 1970); H. R. Kedward, Resistance in VichyFrance, 1940–42(Oxford, 1978) all reveal importantfacets of events in France. See also R.

(Routledge, 1990) compares the humanity of the Italian
army on the Adriatic with the barbarity of the German.
M. Gilbert, The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy* (Collins,1987) is an unbearably detailed account of atrocities all
over occupied Europe. The Israeli scholar D. Bankier,
in The Germans and the Final Solution: Public Opinionunder Nazism(Blackwell, 1992), addresses the import-ant question what Germans knew and thought. The
best one-volume account is L.Dawidowicz, 
The WarAgainst the Jews, 1933–1945* (Penguin, 1990). D. J.Goldhager, Hitler’s Willing Executioners* (Abacus,1997). D. Cesarani ed.

RECOVERY AND GROWTHW. Laqueur, Europe in Our Time, 1945–1992* (Peng-uin, 1993) provides an overview, as does D. Urwin,
Western Europe since 1945: A Political History(Long-man, 1989). M. J. Hogan, The Marshall Plan: America,Britain, and the Reconstruction of Europe* (Cambridge,1989) examines American motivation in seeking to 
integrate a free-market Western Europe; A. S. Milward’s
classic study, The Reconstruction of Western Europe,1945–51* (Routledge, 1987), shows recovery underway before the Marshall Plan could make an impact.BritainK. O. Morgan, The People’s Peace: British History,1945–1990* (Oxford, 1992); the same author has madea special study of the post war Labour record in Labourin Power, 1945–51* (Oxford, 1985) and Labour People*(Oxford, 1990).

(Muller, 1979) and M. Balfour, West Germany: AContemporary History(Croom Helm, 1982). For theAmerican occupation, see J. Gimbel, The AmericanOccupation of Germany: Politics and the Military
(Stanford, 1968). The Konrad Adenauer Memoirs,1945–53, trans. B. Ruhm von Orpen (Weidenfeld &Nicolson, 1966) make for pretty dry reading and can be
supplemented by T. Prittie, Konrad Adenauer(Stacey,1972), by the same author’s biography Wily Brandt:Portrait of a Statesman(Schocken, 1974) and by G.Pridham, Christian Democracy in Western Germany(Croom Helm, 1977).

rule, see M. McCauley (ed.), Communist Power inEurope, 1944–49(Macmillan, 1977), a collection ofessays. There are good studies of individual countries: J.
Korbel, Twentieth Century Czechoslovakia: TheMeanings of its History(Columbia, 1977); H. G.Skilling, Czechoslovakia’s Interrupted Revolution(Princeton, 1976); and Alexander Dubcek’s own mem-
oirs (HarperCollins, 1992) for the stirring events of 
the Prague Spring and Soviet intervention in 1968. 
The origins of the 1989 revolution are recounted 
in H. G. Skilling, Charter 77 and Human Rights inCzechoslovakia(Allen & Unwin, 1981). For Poland seeN. Davies, God’s Playground: A History of Poland(2vols, Columbia, 1981); N, Ascherson, The PolishAugust* (Penguin, 1981), for the workers’ protests in1980–1 and the birth of Solidarity.

ing crises are covered in P. G. Lewis, Political Authoriryand Part Secretaries in Poland, 1975–1983(Cambridge,1989); see also T. Garton-Ash, The Polish Revolution:Solidarity(Cape, 1983). For Yugoslavia before the civil war, S. Pavlowitch, The Improbable Survivor:Yugoslavia and its Problems (Hurst, 1988).Break-up of the Soviet Union and Eastern EuropeA good starting point is the study by Z. Brzezinski, TheGrand Failure: The Birth and Death of Communism in
the Twentieth Century(Scribner’s, 1989). The book,completed in August 1988, foretold that communism
was in terminal crisis and that the ‘reform’ of commu-

nism would fail. Even so perceptive an observer, how-
ever, could not forecast future events with complete
accuracy: he concluded that East Germany; Romania,
China and North Korea were not in crisis, which turned
out to be true for China only and but partially. With
East and central European history changing so rapidly,
books soon became out of date. Of particular value is
Mikhail Gorbachev’s Perestroika: New Thinking for ourCountry and the World* (Collins, 1988), setting out his hopes and intentions; two especially valuable studies
are S. White, Gorbachev in Power* (Cambridge, 1990)and R. Sakwa, Gorbachev and his Reforms, 1985–1990*(Philip Alan, 1990), which contains an extensive bibli-
ography. A stimulating overview is the book of the BBC
Television series, Angus Roxburgh, The Second RussianRevolution: The Struggle for Power in the Kremlin(BBCPublications, 1991). An analysis of issues and problems
can be found in A. Jones and D. E. Powell (eds), SovietUpdate, 1989–1990(Harvard, 1991). Fundamental toan understanding of the Soviet Union is G. Smith (ed.),
The Nationalities Question in the Soviet Union*(Longman, 1990). The revolutions in Eastern and
Central Europe are examined in J. Batt, East CentralEurope from Reform to Transformation* (Royal Insti-tute for International Affairs, 1991) and in K. Dawisha,
Eastern Europe, Gorbachev, and Reform* (2nd edn,Cambridge, 1990). M. Glenny, The Rebirth of History:Eastern Europe in the Age of Democracy* (Penguin,1990) is an account based on personal experiences by
the BBC correspondent. The last period of the unloved
German Democratic Republic is chronicled in a collec-
tion of documents from secret archives: A. Mitter and S.
Wolle, Ich liebe euch dock alle! Befehle und Lageberichtedes MFS Januar-November 1989(Basis Druck, 1990).Eastern and Central Europe is the subject of a number
of new books: K. Williams, The Prague Spring and ItsAftermath(Cambridge, 1997); for the wars inYugoslavia, M. Glenny, The Fall of Yugoslavia(3rd edn,Penguin, 1996), and, outstandingly informative, L.
Silber and A. Little, The Death of Yugoslavia* (revisededn, Penguin, 1996).18THE MIDDLE EAST
Good overviews are P. Mansfield, A History of theMiddle East* (Penguin, 1992) and the same author’sThe Arabs* (5th edn, Penguin, 1992); M. E. Yapp, TheNear East since the First World War* (Longman, 1991);W. R. Polk, The Arab World* (4th edn, Harvard, 1980);D. Hiro, Inside the Middle East* (Routledge & KeganPaul, 1982); E. Kedourie, Politics in the Middle East*(Oxford, 1992); A. H. Hourani, The Emergence of theModern Middle East(Macmillan, 1981); and the sameauthor’s A History of the Arab People* (Faber & Faber,1991).P. J. Vatikotis, History of Modern Egypt: FromMuhammad Ali to Sadat* (4th edn, Weidenfeld &Nicolson, 1991); D. Hopwood, Egypt: Politics andSociety, 1945–1992(3rd edn, Routledge, 1992); A.McDermott, Egypt from Nasser to Mubarak: A FlawedRevolution(Chapman & Hall, 1988).Lord Kinross, Atatürk: The Rebirth of a Nation*(Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1990), readable and informa-
tive; B. Lewis, The Emergence of Modern Turkey(2ndedn, Oxford, 1968); I. C. Schick and E. A. Tonak (eds),
Turkey in Transition: New Perspectives, 1923 to the
Present(Oxford, NY, 1986).N. R. Keddie, The Roots of Revolution: An InterpretiveHistory of Modern Iran* (Yale, 1981); D. Hiro, Iranunder the Ayatollas* (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1985);F. Halliday, Iran: Dictatorship and Development (2ndedn, Penguin, 1979).D. Hopwood, Syria, 1945–1986: Politics and Society*(Routledge, 1991); P. Scale, The Struggle for Syria: AStudy in Post-War Arab Politics (2nd edn, Yale, 1987);and, by the same author, Asad of Syria: The Struggle forthe Middle East* (California, 1989).K. Salibi, The Modern History of Lebanon(Weidenfeld& Nicolson, 1977); H. Cobban, The Making of ModernLebanon* (Hutchinson, 1985).P. Sluglett and M. Farouk-Sluglett, Iraq since 1958:From Revolution to Dictatorship* (I. B. Tauris, 1991);R. Lacey, The Kingdom* (Avon, 1983), a history of1SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING971
Saudi Arabia; D. McDowell, A Modern History of theKurds(Tauris, 1997).A good history of Israel is H. M. Sachar, A History ofIsrael(2 vols, Oxford, NY, 1987).Israel and the Palestine Conflicts.N. Bethell, The Palestine Triangle: The Struggle betweenthe British, the Jews and the Arabs, 1935–1948* (Futura,1980) is a good introduction. This can be followed 
by R. Ovendale, The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Wars*(Longman, 1984). An invaluable collection is 
W. Laqueur and B. Rubin, The Israel-Arab Reader: A Documentary History of the Middle East Conﬂict
*(revised edn, Penguin, 1984). Y. Porath, The Emer-gence of the Palestinian Arab National Movement(2vols, Cass, 1974–7), covers the years 1918 to 1939. B.
Wasserstein, The British in Palestine: The MandatoryGovernment and the Arab-Jewish Conﬂict, 1917–1929
(Royal Historical Society, 1978) is good on the origins
of the conﬂict. See also M. J. Cohen, Palestine: Retreatfrom the Mandate: The Making of British Policy, 1936–45
(Holmes & Meier, 1978); M. Rodinson, Israel and theArabs* (2nd edn, Penguin, 1982). There is a vivid per-
sonal account of the conflict in the 1980s by T.
Friedman, the New York Times correspondent in Beirut
and Jerusalem, From Beirut to Jerusalem* (HarperCollins, 1990).For the great powers and the Middle East a goodoverview is A. Williams, Britain and France in theMiddle East and North Africa, 1914–1967* (Macmillan,1968). With the opening of the British archives for
1956 a reassessment of the Suez war became possible.
Keith Kyle produced a readable, many-faceted account,
Suez(Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1991). W. Scott Lucas,Divided We Stand: Britain, the U.S. and the Suez Crisis
(Hodder & Stoughton, 1991) is both clear and illumi-
nating. Startling in some of its revelations, Ze’ev Schiff
and Ehud Ya’ari, Israel’s Lebanon War(Allen & Unwin,1984) explains that tragic conﬂict. For the bloody war
between Iran and Iraq, see J. Bullock and H. Morris,
The Gulf War: Its Origins, History and Consequences
(Methuen, 1989).19THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT
IndiaJ. M. Brown Modern India: The Origins of an AsianDemocracy* (Oxford, 1985) is one of the best introduc-tions. There is a sizeable literature on British India and
the transfer of power. R. J. Moore covers the period
since 1917 in three studies, The Crisis of Indian Unity,1917–1940 (Oxford, 1974), Churchill, Cripps and India(Oxford, 1979), and Escape from Empire: The AttleeGovernment and the Indian Problem(Oxford, 1983).See also R. B. Tomlinson, The Indian National Congressand the Raj: The Penultimate Phase(Macmillan, 1976);and the same author’s The Political Economy of the Raj,1914–1947(Macmillan, 1979); C. H. Philips and M. D.Wainwright (eds), The Partition of India(Allen &Unwin, 1970). The relevant chapters of P. Ziegler,
Mountbatten(Collins, 1985) provide a sympatheticpicture of the last Viceroy. Still useful are B. P. Lamb,
India: A World in Transition(3rd edn, Praeger, 1968),and P. Spear, A History of India(vol. 2, Penguin, 1970),but both are rather dated. See also S. Wolpert, A NewHistory of India* (4th edn, Oxford, NY, 1992). Theproblem of separatist movements in India is well cov-

ered by a distinguished Indian journalist, M. J. Akbar,
India: The Siege Within: Challenges to a Nation’s Unity*(Penguin, 1985). P. R. Brass, The Politics of India since Independence, vol. iv, I, of The Cambridge History 
of India, (Cambridge, 1990) provides a thematicpolitical-science approach. D. Hiro, Inside India Today(Cambridge, 1976) is a good read and stimulating.
Among excellent biographies, possibly the best way to
study the history of independent India, are J. M.
Brown’s Gandhi: Prisoner of Hope(Yale, 1989) and S.Gopal, Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography(3 vols, Cape,1975–84) the latter abridged to a one-volume edition
(Oxford, 1990). See also K. Bhatia, Indira: A Biographyof Prime Minister Gandhi(Angus Robertson, 1974).PakistanAn excellent one-volume history with an extensive bibliography is Omar Noman, Pakistan: Political andEconomic History since 1947(Kegan Paul, 1988). Thefounding father is the subject of S. Wolpert’s biography,
Jinnah of Pakisian(Oxford, NY, 1984). For contempo-rary Pakistan, see A. Kapur, Pakistan in Crisis(Routledge, 1991).Sri LankaK. M. de Silva, A History of Sri Lanka(Oxford, 1981);M. Ram, Sri Lanka* (Penguin, 1989).BangladeshL. Ziring, Bangladesh: A Political Analysis(Macmillan,1992).Burma (Myanmar)J. Silverstein, Burmese Politics: The Dilemma of NationalUnity(Rutgers, 1980); and, by the same author,Burma: Military Rule and the Politics of Stagnation*(Cornell, 1977).20THE LANDS OF THE PACIFIC
For an overview of south-east and eastern Asia, a good
source book is M. Borthwick (ed.), Paciﬁc Century: The972SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING
Emergence of Modern Paciﬁc Asia
* (Westview Press,1992), with contributions by a number of distinguished
scholars. It is inter-disciplinary in approach; besides brief
historical outlines, it contains valuable data on demog-
raphy, trade relations, economic and social develop-
ments, and inter-regional international relations, up to
1990. The reader is referred to this work especially 
for the recent development of Taiwan, Korea, the
Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia, as well as of 
the giants, China and Japan. A good bibliography is 
provided. The book was written to accompany an
Annenherg US college television course. For a useful
introduction to the transformation from colonial rule to
independence of several Asian nations of India, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaya, see R.

location on the front line of the Cold War has led to a
large number of academic studies: C. J. Eckert, KoreaOld and New: A History(Ilchoak Publishers, Seoul,1990); T. Hatada, A History of Korea(ABC-Clio,1969), an older history stressing Korean traditions and

Sanderson; vol. 7 (From 1905–1940), ed. A.Roberts; vol. 8 (From 1940–1975), ed. M. Crowder(Cambridge, 1984–6). The overall editors of the history
are J. D. Fage and R. Oliver. The best one-volume
overviews are J. D. Fage, A History of Africa* (2nd edn,Unwin Hyman, 1993); B. Davidson, Africa in History*(revised edn, Macmillan, 1992); B. Freund, The Makingof Contemporary Africa: The Development of African
Society since 1800* (Macmillan, 1984). A stimulatingstudy emphasising the African viewpoint is A. A. Mazrui

The Statesman’s Year Bookprovides annual updates ofpertinent information country by country. It is pub-
lished by Macmillan and in 1992–3 was in its 29th 
edition. Another immensely useful reference work pro-
viding good factual accounts of a year’s events country
by country is The Annual Register of World Events,which was ﬁrst edited by Edmund Burke in 1758 and
since then there have been many distinguished editors;
vol. 245, 2003 was edited by D. S. Lewis; specialists
cover the events of the previous year in every country of
the world. For contemporary events there are the press
and documentary programmes on television, but for
good consistent reporting The Economistis invaluable, asare the US weeklies Timeand Newsweek. The Germanversion is Der Spiegel.A number of compendiums periodically updated pro-vide detailed statistical information and more. The
Europa Publicationsare excellent; a series of volumesdevoted to institutions such as A Dictionary of theEuropean Union(2004) and on Arab–Israeli relations.They are revised at regular intervals.  The major ency-

clopaedias also add annual volumes to their most recent
editions. Also available is B. R. Mitchell and B. Redman,
International Historical Statistics. Europe 1750–2000
(5th edn, Macmillan, 2003).Convenient brief accounts of political and economicconditions with useful statistical data are published in a
handy paperback series, Spotlight on Politics, covering a number of countries including Britain, the United
States, China, France and West Germany: I. Derbyshire,
Politics in West Germany from Schmidt to Kohl
(Chambers, 1987); I. Derbyshire, Politics in Francefrom Giscard to Mitterrand(Chambers, 1987); J. D.Derbyshire and I. Derbyshire, Politics in Britain fromCallaghan to Thatcher(Chambers, 1990).An invaluable guide to bibliographies is R. H. Fritze,B. E. Coutts and L. A. Vyhnanek, Reference Sources inHistory: An Introductory Guide(ABC-Clio, 1990). Forcurrent affairs there are an increasing number of internet
sites too numerous to list.1SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING975
