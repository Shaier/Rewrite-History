that they had not invented the wheel; nor did they have important 

domesticated animals, such as the  horse and cow. And they had not 

learned the skills of metallurgy, apart from the hammering of sheet 

copper to make primitive tools and gold and silver for personal orna
-ments. 
None of the hundreds of tribes who resided in the area north of 
pres
ent- 
day Mexico had an alphabet or a written language. Instead 
they resorted to pictographs to record important events, and they sub
-
stituted a sign language and smoke signals to communicate over long 

di
stances. In the south a more culturally advanced society emerged 
among the Aztec and Inca tribes. The Aztecs had a written language 

and a command of mathematics and architecture. Their great stone 

temples commanded the cities and towns in which they were built. It 

has been suggested that the cultural level of the southern tribes in the 

eighth century after Christ was more advanced than that of any of the 

countries in western Eu
rope. If so, the question immediately arises why 
it came to a full stop and never advanced. That is another mystery that 

cannot be satisfactorily explained from evidence presently available. 
More mysteries. According to Norse sagas, sometime around AD 
1000 Vikings  
were blown off course while sailing west from Iceland to 
Greenland, and landed in the New World. Just where they found ref
-uge is uncertain. A little later Leif Eriksson and his crew repeated this 
Distribution of American Indians
4 a short history of the united states 
journey and probably reached  
pres
ent- 
day Newfoundland, or possibly 
some place along the coast of 
modern-
day New En
gland. They made 
camp and explored a wide area, no doubt visiting sections that later 
became part of the United States. Further explorations by other Vi
-kings may have taken them down the St. Lawrence River. 
In any event the Vikings never established permanent settlements in 
th
e New World, and nothing came of their discoveries. It took several 
more centuries for western Eu
rope to begin to initiate important 
changes in its society that would result in the migration of many of its 

people to the New World. 
The Crusades undoubtedly 
tr
iggered a good deal of these changes. 
In 1095
, Pope Urban II called Christians to liberate the Holy Land 
from the Muslims who controlled it. Thousands of Europeans re
-sponded and traveled to the East, where they 
were ex
posed to a differ
-ent and more exotic culture, a way of life that excited their imagination. 
La
ter they returned home from their adventure with new tastes, new 
ideas, new interests, and new demands for foods and goods that they 

had experienced in the East, such as spices, cotton, and silk cloth. 

Their desire for the products of the East was further enhanced by 

Marco Polo’s account of his extensive travels and life in China, pub
-lished in the thirteenth century. The gold and silver as well as the 

spi
ces and silk clothing that Polo described captured the imagination 
of Eu
ropeans. Trade routes were developed to bring these  products to 
an eager market. Soon the manorial,
 agricultural, closed eco
nomy of 
the medieval world gave way to a capitalistic economy based on trade, 

money, and credit. Existing cities ﬂ
ourished and new ones were 

founded. This urban development attracted artisans of every stripe 

who perfected their crafts and initiated a technological revolution. 

The printing press made possible the wide distribution of books and 

stimulated learning. It also contributed to the formation of universi
-ties in a number of cities. The compass and astrolabe  
were introduced 
by which navigation of the seas became safer and encouraged seamen 

to seek new routes and new worlds beyond those already known. 
As a result of these and many other less notable changes the Middle 
Ag
es, with their authoritarian and rigid system of beliefs and practices, 
slowly disintegrated. The power of the pope and bishops who controlled 
5 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
the Catholic church was supplanted by that of ruling monarchs and 
titled noblemen in emerging 
nation-
states. And after Martin Luther 
posted his list of 
ninety-
ﬁve theses on a cathedral door, the Christian 
religion no longer consisted of a single set of beliefs. 
Capitalism, Protestantism, and the  
na
tion-
states ruled by ambitious 
sovereigns combined to bring about modern Europe. 
Once the astrolabe 
al
lowed navigators to determine the longi
-tude of their ships at sea by mea
sur 
ing the angle between the sun and 
the horizon, daring explorers ventured farther down the coast of Af
-rica. Prince Henry of Portugal, known as Henry the Navigator, subsi
-dized expeditions that ultimately crossed the equator and sailed down 
th
e length of Africa. In 
1498
, Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of 
Good Hope, crossed the Indian Ocean, and reached India, where he 

announced to the natives that he had come to trade. 
Reaching the East by the shortest possible route and returning home 
wi
th gold, silver, spices, and other exotic products became an ambitious 
quest for many seamen. An Italian navigator, Christopher Columbus, 

believed he could reach the Orient faster by sailing due west, not 

around the continent of Africa. Despite the objections of her advisers, 

who felt that the long voyage by small caravels into the unknown posed 

dangerous risks, Isabella the Catholic, queen of Castile, who married 

Ferdinand, king of Aragon, to form the nation-
state of Spain, agreed 
to ﬁ
nance the trip. On August 
3, 1492
, three ships, the 
Nina
, Pinta
, and 
Santa Maria
, manned by about ninety sailors, left Palos, Spain, 
and—after a brief stop at the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa— 

headed toward the setting sun. It took enormous courage and superb 

seamanship to undertake this voyage, but on October 
12 at around two 
AM, Columbus and his crew made landfall on what he called San Sal
-vador (it was later named Watlings Island), in the Bahamas. He next 

sighted a much larger island, Hispaniola, and called the natives who 
greeted him Indians, in the mistaken belief that he had arrived in India 

and that China was just a short distance farther west. He returned 

home to a hero’s welcome and made three further trips to this New 

World, but he never found the trea
sures and spices he desired, and he 
died still convinced that he had reached Asia. 
The subsequent exploration of a New World by Portuguese and 
6 a short history of the united states 
Spanish adventurers prompted their respective monarchs, in 
149
4, to 
reach an agreement known as the Treaty of Tordesillas, by which they 
drew a line, north and south, 
1,100
 miles west of the Canary Islands, 
wherein the land west of the line belonged to Spain, and the land east 

of it belonged to Portugal. 
The search for a route to Asia, and the treasure that adventurers 
be
lieved they would ﬁ
nd, continued into the next century. Another 
Italian explorer, Amerigo Vespucci, made several trips along the south
-ern coast of the western hemi
sph
ere and wrote vivid, if largely untrue, 
descriptions of what he called this “New World,” which caught the 

attention of mapmakers and geographers. In 
1507
 a German mapmaker, 
Martin Waldseemuller, who published Vespucci’s accounts, suggested 

that this New World be called America in his honor. Now the conti
-nents of the western hemi
sph
ere had a new name. 
Soon other Spanish explorers headed west in search of fortune and 
glo
ry. These conquistadores  were tough, ruthless soldiers who spared 
no life, Indian or Spanish, to ﬁ
nd the riches and honor they sought. 
They roamed the New World in their search, and in the process of 

their explorations they established an empire for Spain. They were also 

convinced that they 
were performing the will of God by bringing 
Christianity to heathens. 
Hernán Cortés, a particularly brutal but capable leader, made his 
wa
y to the New World in 
1504
. He participated in the conquest of 
Cuba and later commanded an expedition to the Yucatán, where he 

heard stories of great wealth farther west among the Aztecs, who called 

themselves Mexics. He set out with 
500
 men to ﬁ
nd it. Montezuma, 
the Aztec emperor, believed that Cortés was the god Quetzalcoatl re
-
turning to his country as foretold in Aztec mythology. To greet this 

retu
rning god, Montezuma sent him as an offering both food and a 
huge disk the size of a wagon wheel in the shape of a sun and made of 

solid gold. The Spanish realized that they had come upon unbelievable 

wealth, and they meant to have it all. Sharp-
witted and resourceful, 
Cortés played the part of Quetzalcoatl and in 
1519
 captured Monte
-zuma, who paid a handsome ransom for his release. With the help of 

sur
rounding tribes who hated the Mexics, Cortés not only conquered 
the Aztec Nation but also slaughtered the natives with his guns and 

cannons. His conquest was also aided by the diseases his troops carried 
7 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
with them, such as smallpox, inﬂ
uenza, measles, and typhus, to which 
the natives had no immunity. 
The plunder the intruders seized from the Mexics inspired other 
con
quistadores to range up and down the continents, north, south, 
east, and west, looking for precious metals. Francisco Pizarro, one such 
adventurer in search of glory, was told about a civilization farther to the 

south, in what is now Peru, that could provide the wealth he sought. 

After several unsuccessful expeditions he gained the conﬁ
 dence of the 
Emperor, Charles V of Spain, from whom he received support in ex
-change for  
one-
ﬁfth of all the trea
sure Pizarro discovered. In 
1531
 the 
conquistador set out with several hundred men and discovered the Inca 

civilization in Peru. He overwhelmed all re
sistance, murdered the 
Emperor, Atahuallpa, and made off with a fortune in gold and silver. 
These discoveries and the mines that produced such wealth enriched 
Spai
n and ﬁ
nanced its expansion as the power
house of Eu
rope, but the 
infusion of so much wealth into Spain also brought about inﬂ
 ation that 
drove the price of goods upward to unpre cedented levels. 
Spaniards swarmed over the Americas. In 
1565
 the Spanish monarch 
sent Pedro Menéndez de Avilés to establish settlements along the 

North American coast. In September of that year Menéndez founded 

St. Augustine in what is now Florida. It was the ﬁ
rst permanent Eu
ro-pean settlement in North America. Colonies were also established in 

th
e Ca
rib
bean, and in Central and South America, with viceroys ap
-pointed to represent the monarch and administer these colonies. 

But abso
lute authority resided in the king, who ruled through the 
Council of the Indies in Spain. The council members nominated of
-ﬁcials and drafted the laws and rules by which the colonies were to be 
governed. 
Spanish society in the Americas consisted of several ranks. Those in 
th
e highest rank had been born in Spain and  were called 
peninsulares
. Next came those born in America of Spanish parents. They were known 

as criollos
, most of whom 
were landowners. These two groups formed 
the upper class of society in New Spain. Those of mixed Spanish and 

Indian blood  
were known as 
mestizos
. Lower on the social and eco
-nomic scale  
were th
e natives who had adopted Spanish life and culture 
and constituted the broad laboring class. Next 
were the mulattoes, 

those of mixed European and African blood. At the bottom of the 
8 a short history of the united states 
ladder  
were bl
ack slaves brought from Africa to work in the mines and 
ﬁelds of the Spanish conquerors. 
Most important was the position of the Roman Catholic church. 
Lik
e Spain, the church and state 
were intricately entwined, each serv
-ing the other to the advantage of both. 
Spanish expeditions also resulted in the discovery, in 
1513
, of the 
Paciﬁ
c Ocean by Vasco de Balboa, and Florida by Juan Ponce de Leon. 
Even the globe was circumnavigated by an expedition that started from 
St. Lucar in 
1519
 and led by Ferdinand Magellan, who was killed in a 
battle with natives in what today are known as the Philippine Islands. 

Of the ﬁ
ve ships and 
250 original sailors that set out on this remarkable 
voyage in 
1519
, only one ship and eigh
teen men returned home in 
1522
. Hernando de Soto fought his way north into 
pres
ent- 
day Georgia and 
the Carolinas from 
1539
 to 1542
, and then westward through Tennessee, 
Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas. And Francisco de Coronado led a 

force from Mexico in 
1540
 into the interior of North America in search 
of the legendary Seven Cities of Cibola, that were believed to be paved 

with gold. California was explored by Juan Cabrillo in 
1542;
 and Catho
-lic priests established missions to convert Indian tribes to Christianity. 
The great success 
Spain enjoyed in establishing a worldwide 
em
pire, and raking in a fabulous fortune in the process, encouraged 
other emerging nations in Eu
rope to follow suit and carve out areas for 
colonization for themselves. France began its reach for empire in 
1534
, when the king commissioned Jacques Cartier to search for a Northwest 

Passage that would lead to the Indies. Cartier failed to ﬁ
nd such a pas
-sage, but in several voyages he laid claim to the eastern half of Canada 

an
d a slice of land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mis
-sissippi River. Later, Samuel de Champlain explored the St. Lawrence 

Ri
ver area and founded the cities of Quebec and Montreal. The lucra
-tive fur trade in the Great Lakes area became a source of wealth, but it 

di
d not attract many French settlers. The Indians constituted the bulk 
of the population in New France, and Champlain succeeded in forging 

an alliance with the Hurons that helped that tribe defeat their ancient 

enemy, the Iroquois. 
The Iroquois  
were pr
obably more culturally advanced than some 
9 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
other tribes. They occupied the region south of the St. Lawrence River 
and Lake Ontario. The Five Nations of the Iroquois included the Sen
-eca, Onondaga, Mohawk, Cayuga, and Oneida, and  
we
re later joined 
by the Tuscarora, becoming the Six Nations. 
Farther north, above the St. Lawrence, lived the Algonquin tribes, 
pr
incipally the Hurons, who  
were leagued with the French. This alli
-ance was a natural one, since the French desired furs and the beaver 

po
pulation in the Algonquin country was judged the best. The Iroquois 
sought to defeat the Hurons to obtain the furs, which they wanted to 

exchange for guns, resulting in intermittent Indian wars in which the 

Iroquois came close to driving the French from North America. 
The Dutch also tried their hand at enlarging their possessions and 
obta
ining wealth. In 
1609
 Henry Hudson sailed up the river that now 
bears his name and established trading posts. The Dutch West India 

Company controlled several such posts: the most important of these 

were New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, which later became New 

York, and Fort Orange, which was renamed Albany after the En
glish 
occupied them following the Dutch War. Like the French, the Dutch 

concentrated on obtaining furs, not on colonization, and they regularly 

traded guns for furs with the Iroquois. 
Then there 
were the En
glish: those  
Anglo-
Saxons perched on 
islands in the North Sea and protected by water that they soon ruled. 
With stout ships and even stouter hearts they searched the world to 

create an empire. As early as 
1497
, under King Henry VII, an Italian by 
the name of John Cabot hunted for a westward passage to the Orient, 

ﬁrst along Newfoundland and a year later farther south along the 
North American coastline, thereby giving En
gland a claim to a large 
segment of what later became the United States. But not until the reign 

of Queen Elizabeth I, a Protestant, did the English take a serious in
-terest in the New World. For the most part they struck at Spanish power 

by attacking its merchant and treasure ships plying the high seas. Buc
-caneers such as John Hawkins and Francis Drake brought home to 

th
eir queen a hoard of gold and silver. Elizabeth both disclaimed any 
involvement in the raids and at the same time knighted Drake after he 

circumnavigated the globe and scooped up a veritable fortune. Philip 
10 
a short history of the united states 
II, the Spanish king, struck back in 
1588
 wi
th a mighty Armada of 
130 
ships armed with thousands of cannons, hoping to subdue the En
glish 
and restore them to Catholicism. Between the intrepid British sailors, 
their highly maneuverable ships, and punishing storms at sea the ar
-mada was crippled, and only about half the original number of Spanish 

shi
ps reached the safety of their ports. England could now make a bid 
for possession of a healthy chunk of the North American continent. 
A few years earlier, in 
1585
, Sir Walter Raleigh dispatched a small 
group of settlers, who landed on a tiny island off  present- 
day North 
Carolina and named it Roanoke. The attempted invasion of En
gland 
by the Spanish Armada postponed any effort to keep Roanoke sup
-plied. When assistance did arrive in 
1591
, the  
would-
be rescuers found 
the island completely deserted. No one, to this day, knows what hap
-pened to the settlers. 
Despite this disaster, adventurous English merchants still had hopes 
of
 sponsoring colonization of the New World in the expectation of 
imitating the discoveries of the Spanish. A group of them formed a 

joint- 
stock company, the London Company, in which shares  
were sold 
to stockholders for twelve pounds ten shillings, in order to sponsor col
-onization by settlers in North America. A charter granted by James I, 

th
e ﬁ rst of the Stuart kings, who succeeded Elizabeth upon her death 
in 1603
, allowed the company to develop the land from the coastline 
westward to the Paciﬁ
c Ocean. The area was named Virginia after 
Elizabeth, known as the Virgin Queen because she had never married. 

Three ships, the 
Susan Constant
, the 
Goodspeed
, and the 
Discovery
, sailed from En
gland in December 
1606
 and landed in Virginia in April 
1607
: the settlement was named Jamestown. 
These colonists searched for gold, but there was none. Conditions at 
the triangular fort they built worsened with each month. John Smith 
took control of the colony during the terrible winter of 
1609
–1610 known 
as the “starving time,” and those who survived ate roots, acorns, berries, 

and even their  
horses. They received help from the Powhatan tribes 
who taught them how to grow corn and where best to catch ﬁ
 sh. But 
relations between the Indians and the English became strained to the 

breaking point because of the rapaciousness of the En
glish, and Smith 
was taken prisoner by a hunting party while on an exploring expedition. 

He was turned over to Opechancanough, who was probably the half 
11 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
brother of Chief Powhatan, and threatened with death. As a young boy, 
Opechancanough had been kidnaped by the Spanish in 
1559. He was 
sent to Spain to learn western customs and culture and the Spanish 

language so that he could be trained and serve as an interpreter and 

translator between the Indians and the Spanish. He was even given a 

Spanish name: Don Luis de Velasco. On his return home, sometime in 

the late 
1570
s, he renounced his Spanish afﬁ
liations and reclaimed his 
position of authority within the Powhatan tribe. He may also have been 

instrumental in the slaughter of the missionaries who accompanied him 

back to Virginia. Most likely he would have killed John Smith, had it 

not been for Pocahontas, the favorite daughter of the Powhatan chief. 
At the time, Pocahontas was only eleven years of age, so it is un
-likely that there was a romantic reason for her action. A number of 

historians have guessed that in successfully pleading for Smith’s life 
she may have been acting out an Algonquin rite in which the power of 

Chief Powhatan over life and death was demonstrated by accepting 

Smith and his fellow settlers in Jamestown into his overlordship. By 

their ac
know
ledg
ment of his superior position he granted them his 
protection. What
ever the true reason for Pocahontas’s action, she ex
-tended her friendship with other En
glish s
ettlers. She converted to 
Christianity and married John Rolfe, one of the settlers, in 
1614
, and 
their marriage strengthened the friendship between the Powhatans 

sand the settlers. Pocahontas later traveled to En
gland, where she was 
treated with the deference due her Indian rank and presented to the 

king and queen. Unfortunately, she contracted smallpox and died at 

age  
twenty-
two. 
Instead of gold, the colonists discovered the value of tobacco, which 
th
e Indians had smoked for centuries. Introduced in Eu
rope, this 
“ﬁlthy” habit, as King James labeled it, became very fashionable, and 
the increasing demand provided the settlers with a cash crop they des
-perately needed to survive. The value of the trade brought more and 

more
 English settlers to America. As a result, large plantations soon 
evolved to grow the plant, and Virginia became a thriving colony. 
The London Company sent Thomas Dale, a military man, to gov
-ern Virginia, and he instituted stern mea
sure
s to ensure the continued 
life of the community. Then, in 
1619, the company instructed the 
governor to summon two landowning representatives from each of the 
12 
a short history of the united states 
small settlements in the colony to meet in Jamestown to provide advice. 
Twe
nty-
two men gathered in the church in town, disregarded the 
company’s instructions, and proceeded to enact a series of laws for the 

colony against gambling, drunkenness, idleness, and  
Sabbath-
breaking. 
This  
House of Burgesses, as it came to be called, then adjourned. But 
it was clear right from the beginning that English settlers  
were pre
-pared to go their own way and address problems they felt 
were im
por
-tant for their safety and livelihood. Their action demonstrated a degree 

of i
nde pen
dence that would be imitated by future legislative bodies in 
North America in asserting their right to solve their own problems in 

their own way. 
As the settlers in and around Jamestown prospered, their number 
stead
ily increased, so that by 
1620
 there  
were roughly 
2,000 colonists. 
Opechancanough watched with dismay the steady strengthening of 

white men’s control of the region to the detriment of the Powhatan 

tribes. He therefore decided to put a stop to it. Early in the morning of 

March 
22, 1622, a number of Indians who  
were unarmed circulated in 
several settlements and appeared to be friendly. Then, suddenly, they 

seized muskets and axes and began a systematic slaughter of the inhab
-itants. It was a typical Indian ploy: an outward show of friendship to 

al
lay the apprehensions of the colonists, followed by a sudden, swift 
killing spree. They wiped out about a third of the settlers, who retali
-ated with lethal force and attempted to drive the tribe further west. 

Th
e slaughter on both sides and the resulting turmoil  
were so intense 
that King James revoked the London Company’s charter in 
1624
 and 
made Virginia a royal colony. But the change in government did not 

end the killing. Sometime after Powhatan’s death, probably in 
1628
, Opechancanough became the “Paramount Chief ” and renewed the 

ﬁghting, although sporadically. Then, in 
1644
, he launched what the 
colonists called the “great assault” of 
1644
, in which Opechancanough 
killed over 
500
 settlers. But the chief was old, possibly about 
100
 years, 
and his faculties were sharply diminished. He was captured and after a 

short time in prison he was assassinated. Thus ended the Powhatan 

War. 
During the interim the  
House of Burgesses made every effort to 
meet regularly, and in 
1639
 the king instructed the governor to 
summon 
13 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
the Burgesses together each year, a recognition of what had already 
become regular practice. 
Not all the 
settlers who came to America searched for gold or 
ot
her forms of ﬁ
nancial gain. A great number came in pursuit of reli
-gious freedom. Following the Protestant Reformation and the religious 

wa
rs between the various sects and creeds, persecution of opposing re
-ligious beliefs became standard practice. In England the Anglican 

ch
urch was established by the monarchy in opposition to the Roman 
Catholic church, although Anglicanism retained many Catholic cere
-monies and rituals. As a consequence, any number of Protestants felt 

tha
t the Church of En
gland needed to be puriﬁ
ed of such trappings, 
and they became known as Puritans. Others, more radical in their 

thinking, felt compelled to separate themselves from the Anglican 

church altogether. 
A group of En
glish s
eparatists sought even more religious freedom 
and ﬂ
ed to Holland in 
1608
, only to ﬁ
nd life in this foreign country 
totally unsuited to their needs and temperament. They decided to relo
-cate. They gained permission from the London Company to settle in 

Vi
rginia. Thus authorized, they departed Holland and sailed aboard 
the 
Mayﬂ ower
 to the New World. 
They never got to Virginia. They landed at Plymouth on Cape Cod 
on Nov
ember 
21, 1620
, and before they left the ship to establish their 
colony,  
forty-
one of them signed a compact by which they pledged al
-legiance to their “dread sovereign, the King” and did “covenant and 

com
bine” themselves into “a civil Body Politick.” They further prom
-ised to obey what 
eve
r laws 
were thought “meet and con
venient for the 
general Good of the Colony.” This Mayﬂ
ower Compact thereby be
-came the authority by which the settlers made their own laws and 

ch
ose their own ofﬁ
cials. They then disembarked. 
It is interesting to note that these settlers made an agreement that 
th
ey committed to paper, stating their position on government and the 
means by which they had formed their society. The Mayﬂ
 ower Com
-pact became one of many more such documents to follow, by which the 

pe
ople of this New World spoke openly about the ways they would 
14 
a short history of the united states 
be governed and the principles on which their government would rest. 
Re
lying on a written document as an authority became an American 
custom in enunciating principles and practices by which the inhabit
-ants in the society would be governed. 
It was the Pilgrims’ good fortune that they were met by two 
English
- speaking  
Indians—Squanto, a Pawtuxet tribesman, and 
Samoset, a  
Pemaquid—who helped them arrange a peaceful agree
-ment with the surrounding Indian tribes. The Indians also taught 

th
em how to raise corn and showed them the best places to ﬁ
 sh and 
hunt. The colony survived and prospered, and the colonists gave thanks 

for their good fortune. 
Back in En
gla
nd, King Charles I, who succeeded the “dread sover
-eign” James I, gave a group of Puritans permission to form a  joint- 
stoc
k company in 
1629
 called the Massachusetts Bay Company, by which they 
could establish a colony in an area north of Virginia that John Smith 

had described in one publication as New England. John Winthrop, like 

many other Puritans, had become deeply troubled about the moral life 

in En
gland and the future of religion. He decided to leave and take his 
immediate family with him. As an inﬂ
uential administrator of the Com
-pany, he was chosen to lead a “Great Migration” of Puritans to America. 

Nu
mbering more than 
1,000 men, women, and children aboard a ﬂ
 eet 
of 17 ships, these Puritans left En
gland on May 
22, 1630
, with John 
Winthrop as their governor, and arrived in America on June 
12, 1630
, eventually settling in Boston. Upon their arrival, Winthrop assured his 

followers that if they bound themselves together “as one man,” God 

would protect them and ensure their prosperity. “We shall be as a City 

upon a Hill; the eyes of all people are upon us
. . . . 
We shall be made a 
sto
ry and a byword throughout the World.” They believed that they had 
formed a covenant with God to build a society based on the teachings of 

the Bible. Church, state, family, and individuals  were bound together as 

a unit to create a government and community in accordance with de
-mands of the Almighty. Many of the settlers  
were well ed
ucated and 
had enough money to set themselves up in trade, commerce, or farming. 

Within a few years the population of the colony numbered 
20,000, dis
-persed among several surrounding towns. 
The Massachusetts Bay Company had decided to relocate its entire 
op
eration to America, taking the charter along as well. That meant 
15 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
there was no need to consult with or take directions from any group in 
England in making governmental decisions. To a very large extent, the 
Company was totally on its own. The colony was administered by 

the governor and eigh
teen assistants elected by the freemen, called the 
General Court. In 
1634
 the General Court, responding to criticism, 
allowed each town to elect deputies to sit with the assistants. Then, 

ten years later, the court divided into two  
houses, thus creating a bi
-cameral legislature to fashion the laws for the entire Massachusetts Bay 

Col
ony. 
But there  
were dis
senters among them who objected to par
tic 
ular 
rulings or actions, or the system of government. One of these was 

Roger Williams, a young Puritan who led a congregation in Salem 

and who preached unacceptable heresy—at least it was heresy to the 

ruling clergy in Boston. Williams truly respected the Indian tribes 

and their culture. He made no attempt to convert them to Christian
-ity. He felt that individuals could differ in the way they worshipped 

Go
d. He even tolerated different interpretations of the Bible. God’s 
gift of faith in the formulation of one’s conscience was the only road to 

salvation in practicing one’s religion, he preached. He was banished 

from the colony because he questioned the right of a civil government 

to enforce religious beliefs. But he foiled an attempt to ship him back 

to En
gland by escaping into the wilderness and ﬂ
 eeing south. With a 
group of his followers he founded the town of Providence, the ﬁ
 rst 
Rhode Island community where religious freedom and separation of 

church and state 
were made possible. In 
1644
 he received a charter for 
his  
colony. 
Anne Hutchinson, another dissenter, held meetings in her home to 
discuss religious matters and the worth of individual clergymen. She 
preached a “covenant of grace” that emphasized an individual’s direct 

communication with God through divine grace. She attracted a con
-siderable following. Condemned as an “antinomian,” she was expelled 

fr
om the colony in 
1637
. She and her disciples ﬂ
ed to Rhode Island and 
joined the followers of Roger Williams. She and her family  were later 

murdered by Indians. 
One of the most pop ular preachers in the Massachusetts Colony was 
Th
omas Hooker, and his very popularity generated jealousy among 
other preachers, most notably John Cotton, the se nior minister in the 
16 
a short history of the united states 
colony. Rather than face expulsion, Hooker decided to lead his congre
-gation across the wooded wilderness to the Connecticut River valley, 

where h
is followers established themselves in Hartford, Windsor, and 
Wethersﬁ
eld. Hooker himself was instrumental in writing the bylaws 
for the colony’s government, called “The Fundamental Orders of Con
-necticut.” Like Rhode Island, but unlike in Massachusetts, church 

me
mbership was not a condition for voting; nor 
were clergymen per
-mitted to participate in politics. A charter was granted in 
1662. In an effort to establish a colony that would be loyal to the Anglican 
ch
urch and would act as a rival to Massachusetts, Sir Ferdinando 
Gorges obtained a charter to establish a settlement in Maine; but he 

died before he could attract immigrants, and his heirs sold the charter 

to Massachusetts. Thus Massachusetts and Maine  
were joined as a 
single colony. Moreover, another attempt at colonizing a northern por
-tion of New En
gla
nd in what is now New Hampshire also failed. The 
area was subsequently settled in 
1638
 by another preacher who had been 
banished from Massachusetts, John Wheelwright, the  
brother-
in-
law 
of Anne Hutchinson. The original grant was subsequently revoked, 

and in 
1679 New Hampshire became a royal colony. 
Catholics also sought refuge in the New World. George Calvert, the 
ﬁrs
t Lord Baltimore, obtained a charter in which he hoped to establish 
a colony for Catholics, he himself having converted to that faith. Under 

his plan, he would be the proprietor, and the land, involving millions of 

acres, his private estate. Those who settled on this property would pay 

him a land tax, called a quitrent; he, in turn, was required to pay the 

king two Indian arrows each Easter. Calvert was empowered to ap
-point the governor, judges, and councilors; or
ga
nize the court system
; and authorize a legislature to enact the laws. However, George Calvert 

died before the king had given his ﬁ
nal approval to this proprietorship, 
and it was inherited in 
1632
 by Calvert’s son, Cecil, the second Lord 
Baltimore, who immediately sent out an expedition to establish the 

colony of Mary
land. Unfortunately, the area impinged on the charter 
granted to the Virginia Company, provoking repeated conﬂ
 icts be
-tween the two authorities. And although Calvert expected to dictate 

hi
s wishes to the settlers as commands, the settlers had other ideas. 
When the ﬁ
 rst Mary
land legislature met in 
1635
, it insisted on the right 
to enact its own laws, and Calvert wisely agreed to this. But Catholics 
17 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
did not swarm into Mary
land as the proprietor had hoped. Instead 
many more Protestants took advantage of his liberal land grants, and 
by the end of the century they outnumbered Catholics ten to one. In 

1649
 the Mary
land assembly accepted Lord Baltimore’s proposal and 
passed a Toleration Act, stating that no person who believed in Christ 

would be persecuted for practicing his or her religion. But since 

non-
Christians  
were excluded from the colony, this legislation had only 
limited claim to toleration. 
Thus, over a relatively short period of time, there developed in the 
English colonies in America three forms of government: royal, corpo
-rate, and proprietary. 
Another proprietary colony was formed when Charles II paid off a 
seri
es of debts to a group of eight men who had helped him regain the 
throne in 
1660
 after the Puritan Revolution that executed his father, 
Charles I, in 
1649
, and established a dictatorship under Oliver Crom
-well. This colony lay between Virginia and Spanish Florida, and the 

ch
arter was granted in 
1663
. The proprietors expected to attract set
-tlers from Barbados, Virginia, and New En
gl
and and proﬁ
t from a 
trade in rice, ginger, and silk. The area was named Carolina after 

Charles’s wife, Queen Caroline. One distinctive feature of this propri
-etary colony was the plan of government drawn up by one of the pro
-prietors, Anthony Ashley Cooper, the earl of Shaftesbury, and his 

secreta
ry, John Locke. It was called the Fundamental Constitutions of 
Carolina, and it attempted to engraft in America a feudal system with 

a sharply deﬁ
 ned social structure, including titles, and a similar hier
-archical judicial system. Although it recognized and legalized 

slaver
y—Carolina was the ﬁ
rst colony to do so  
openly—it did provide 
for religious freedom and a representative assembly. Settlers  
were drawn to this inviting area, but they disregarded the feudal 
aspects— 

which could never take root in America, because of the vastness of the 

land—and enjoyed the more liberal attractions of the Fundamental 

Constitutions. By the end of the century some 
50,000 colonists popu
-lated the region. But they tended to concentrate in two areas: one to 

th
e north around Albemarle Sound, in what is presently North Caro
-lina; and one 
300
 mi
les to the south around a community named after 
the king, Charles Town, today’s Charleston. Both areas prospered and 

enjoyed increased migration from other parts of the English colonies. 
18 
a short history of the united states 
In North Carolina the inhabitants grew tobacco and provided naval 
sto
res to shipbuilders. In South Carolina, because of the moisture, 
temperature, and soil conditions, the colonists cultivated rice and in
-digo, which is used as a dye. 
Many of the Carolina colonists  
were S
cots-
Irish who  
were predomi
-nantly Presbyterian in their religious beliefs and had initially moved 

fr
om lowland Scotland to northern Ireland, where they remained for 
many years before crossing the ocean and settling in the Carolinas. 

They engaged the various Indian tribes in defending themselves against 

the Spanish in Florida. These tribes included the Wateree, Congaree, 

Santee, Waxhaw, and Catawba, all of whom belonged to the Siouan 

group. The most dominant tribe, however, was the powerful and ﬁ
 erce 
Cherokee Nation, who  
were concentrated in the mountains to the west 
and related to the Iroquois farther north. 
The Carolina settlers frequently aided one group of Indians against 
another in combat and regularly sold captured natives into slavery. Be
-fore long these settlers had exterminated or enslaved the Indians in the 

Ca
rolinas, or reduced them to a state of total dependence. 
Charles II and 
hi
s brother James, the Duke of York, who later 
succeeded Charles as James II, cast covetous eyes on the Dutch colony 

of New Netherland, especially the attractive port at the foot of Man
-hattan Island where the Hudson River ran into the ocean. The Dutch 

had no
t been as successful as the En
glish in establishing colonies since 
its citizens lacked the impetus of English settlers in migrating to 

America. The people in New Amsterdam, for example, had little re
-gard for the Dutch West India Company and its autocratic governors. 

Th
e most recent dictator, Peter Stuyvesant. arrived as governor in the 
colony on May 
11, 1647
, looking “like a peacock.” He was all pomp and 
majesty. He wore a decorated peg leg, having lost his own in a pitched 

battle several years earlier. Determined to bring order and  one-
man 
control to the colony, he ruled for seventeen years by stern decrees that 

won him few friends and many enemies. 
Since En
gland and Holland  
were commercial rivals, it did not take 
long for Charles to initiate a war by granting to his brother James all 

the land between the Connecticut and Delaware rivers. Then a British 
19 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
ﬂeet appeared in the harbor of New Amsterdam and demanded the 
surrender of Manhattan Island. The governor, Peter Stuyvesant, swore 
he would never surrender, but the leading citizens overruled him. They 

knew they could not ﬁ
ght off the  
well-
armed and determined British, 
so they persuaded Stuyvesant to surrender the colony. And not a shot 

was ﬁ
red. James, now the proprietor, renamed the colony New York. 
He blithely assumed he could rule the Dutch settlers through his cho
-sen governor without any consultation whatsoever with the residents. 

He
 soon learned that such an approach from across thousands of miles 
of ocean guaranteed disobedience and lawlessness. Thus, when he suc
-ceeded his brother as King James II, he did permit the calling of a 

legisl
ative assembly. Still, his regular disregard of the needs and re
-quests of the New York colonists only generated further discord. The 

sy
stem of semifeudal landholdings of the original Dutch settlers fur
-ther exacerbated the problem. It produced social, economic, and ethnic 

tensio
ns between them and the new En
glish arrivals. 
James turned over the lower section of his holdings to two friends, 
Lo
rd John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. Since Carteret had served 
as governor of Jersey in the English Channel, the area was named New 

Jersey in his honor. Berkeley was in charge of the western half of the 

province and Carteret of the eastern half. Both men later sold their 

proprietorships, and Puritans, Anglicans, and Quakers settled the di
-vided province until the King united East and West Jersey into a single 

ro
yal colony in 
1702. One of the more successful attempts at establishing a proprietary col
-ony resulted from a grant of land in the New World from Charles II to 

Wi
lliam Penn. While studying at Oxford, Penn joined a radical religious 
sect, the Society of Friends, whose members denounced war, rejected the 

authority of priests and bishops, abhorred ceremonial worship, and obeyed 

only what they called the “inner light of conscience.” These Quakers even 

refused to bow to the king or remove their hats when confronted by royal 

ofﬁ
cials. They professed complete  
equality—none excepted. 
William Penn embraced their beliefs with a fervor that landed him 
in p
rison and provoked the anger and disappointment of his father, 
Admiral William Penn. Once released from jail, he took up missionary 

work in Holland and Germany, where he or
ganized Quaker societies. 
Since Charles owed Admiral Penn a large sum of money, he agreed to 
20 
a short history of the united states 
grant the son a tract of land in full payment of the debt. William Penn 
real
ized that it could be a haven for persecuted Quakers, and in 
1681
 he received a charter, which made him the proprietor of what is now the 

state of Pennsylvania. Young Penn also persuaded the duke of York to 

cede to him the three lower counties on the Delaware River that the 

Dutch had seized from the Swedes years earlier. These three counties 

remained a part of the Penn proprietary domain until the American 

Revolution, when they asserted their in
de pen
dence and became the 
state of Delaware. 
What is remarkable about Pennsylvania was the liberality with 
which it was governed. It became a “holy experiment” in which every
-one could live in peace and harmony. And that included Indians. In his 

Fr
ame of Government of 
1682, Penn included a governor with an ap
-pointed council who originated all laws, along with an assembly, which 

in
itially lacked real authority but over time became more  self-
assertive. 
Most important of all, Penn advertised in England and on the conti
-nent, inviting people of all nationalities to settle in his colony and 

of
fering land at extremely low prices. Dutch, Welsh, Swedish, French, 
German, and English emigrants responded to his appeals, and Penn
-sylvania soon became the most populous and prosperous of all the 

Am
erican colonies. 
In 1732, Georgia was founded, when James Oglethon obtained a 
tw
enty-one-year charter from George II to a group of trustees for land 
between Savannah and Altmaha rivers. 
Because of climate 
va
riations, soil conditions, the type of set
-tlers, and the reasons that brought them to the different areas of the 
Ne
w World, among other things, a distinctive culture soon evolved 
within each of three areas: the New England, Middle, and Southern 

colonies. New En
gland, for example, engaged in shipbuilding because 
of the sturdy, straight, tall pines that grew throughout the region. Fish
-ing also became an important component of the New England economy. 

Bu
t many settlers built small farms in clusters around a seaport or far
-ther inland near rivers or streams. Each cluster comprised a village, with 

a sect
ion of land held as commons to serve all the nearby inhabitants for 
such purposes as grazing cattle. Since the settlers  
were predominantly 
21 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
Puritan, their lives centered on the local church they built and the min
-ister who preached to them and guarded their moral behavior. The New 
Engla
nd colonies were founded primarily for religious purposes. 
In the Middle colonies, farming and commerce developed in which 
whea
t, corn, and vegetables  
were grown; while beavers, raccoons, and 
other animals provided fur for export. Ships from New York City and 

Philadelphia regularly put to sea carry
ing these commodities not only to 
22 
a short history of the united states 
Europe but also to the southern colonies and the West Indies. Most set
-tlers had farms of small or moderate size, except in New York, where the 
Du
tch had laid out enormous estates that extended across an entire 
county, such as the Van Rensselaer tract that straddled both sides of the 
Hudson River. The Dutch inﬂ
uence in New York continued after the ar
-rival of the En
glish a
nd had an impact on architecture, language, and 
customs. Germans in Pennsylvania added a strong ﬂ
avor to the colony’s 
culture. Although Pennsylvania had been founded for religious and ide
-alistic reasons, the other middle colonies 
were sett
led to exploit the wealth 
of the area. The population of this region tended to be quite diverse. 
Because the cultivation and harvesting of tobacco, cotton, rice, and 
in
digo in the Southern colonies necessitated the creation of sizable 
plantations and a large workforce, life in this section of the New World 

was distinctly different from that in regions farther north. Initially 

there was the reliance on indentured servants, individuals who signed 

contracts to work for a period of four or ﬁ
ve years for the holder of their 
contract in return for passage to America. Then in 
1619 a Dutch ship 
arrived in Virginia with twenty Africans who may have been slaves or 

indentured servants. It is not clear just what their status was. In any 

case, slavery soon became institutionalized, as more and more Africans 

were brought to America. By 
1700
 there existed in the South a master 
class and a slave class, and life and death 
were determined by the for
-mer without regard for the rights or needs of the latter. A small middle 

class that provided ser
vices not available on plantations, such as legal 
assistance, arose in urban centers of the South near harbors and sea
-ports. The people of these Southern colonies tended to be more homo
-geneous than those of the Middle and New England colonies. 
And the governments of these British colonies differed in some par
-ticulars, depending on whether they were royal, corporate, or proprie
-tary, but they had several common characteristics. Each colony had a 

govern
or who represented the king, the proprietor, or the corporation 
and was expected to enforce all En
glish laws passed by Parliament or 
the policies devised by the Privy Council who advised the king. In 

purely local matters, the governors had wide discretion. They were 

advised by resident landowners who  
were appointed to their position. 
Elected assemblies or legislatures enacted local laws but theoretically 

had limited power since their actions could be annulled by the gover
-23 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
nor or the royal authority in En
gland. In actual practice, however, 
these elected assemblies exerted considerable authority. Since they en
-acted local taxes they had the power of the purse, which they used to 
com
pel the governor to heed their demands. They could deprive him of 
his salary, for example, or the salaries of his assistants. He, in turn, 

could dismiss them and call for new elections; but he could not compel 

them to pass laws they opposed. 
James II did attempt to exercise greater control over several northern 
co
lonies in 
1686
, when he created the Dominion of New En
gland, con
-sisting of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hamp
-shire. Later he added the colonies of New York and New Jersey. He 

ap
pointed Sir Edmund Andros governor of this dominion, and granted 
him the power to enact laws, including taxes. The loss of the consider
-able freedom the colonists had enjoyed engendered resentment and 

an
ger. And Andros himself was a mistake. Arbitrary, contemptuous of 
individual rights and traditions, he exercised dictatorial rule over the 

settlers and soon came to grief. 
King James was hated both in America and in En
gla
nd, especially 
for his deﬁ
ance of Parliament and its laws. He was overthrown in the 
Glorious Revolution of 
1688
. As a Catholic in spirit if not in fact, he 
was feared by many Protestants, who revolted when James’s wife gave 

birth to a son who would inherit the throne, most probably as a Cath
-olic. So Parliament invited James’s daughter Mary, a Protestant, and 

he
r husband, William of Orange, to take the En
glish throne as a pair. 
When word of James’s overthrow reached Boston, the colonists arrested 

Andros and terminated the Dominion of New En
gland. The colonial 
governments and local ofﬁ
 cials 
were reestablished. The Parliament in 
England made no attempt to resurrect the dominion. 
The action of James II in establishing the Dominion of New En
-gland to bring the northern colonies under closer supervision, and the 

act
ion of his pre 
deces sor, Charles II, in creating a Council of Trade 
and a Council of Foreign Plantations, by which a favorable balance of 

trade with the colonies could be achieved,  
were not simply expressions 
of po
liti
cal ambitions or goals. Actually they reﬂ
ected economic need. 
These monarchs hoped to acquire wealth for En
gland, and that meant 
gold and silver. To achieve such wealth necessitated a favorable balance 

of trade, wherein the money owed to a nation would be paid in specie. 
24 
a short history of the united states 
Colonies 
were th
erefore necessary to provide the goods the mother 
country could sell 
abroad—selling more to foreigners than it bought 
and thus producing the favorable balance. The American colonies 
could supply raw materials such as tobacco, naval stores, cotton, rice, 

indigo, furs, and sugar, which En
gland could sell to other nations. At 
the same time the colonies would provide a market for the mother 

country’s manufactured goods. This program was called mercantilism, 

and through a series of Navigation and Trade Acts, Parliament in the 

seventeenth and eigh
teenth centuries acted to monopolize the trade of 
its colonies and exclude foreign nations from that trade. 
In Boston a mercantile class developed, transporting furs, naval 
stores, and ﬁ
sh to other colonial and Ca
rib
bean ports. The Bostonian 
merchants traded lumber and furs for West Indian molasses, which 

could be distilled into rum. New En
gland shippers took their wares to 
England and the Eu
ropean continent and then sailed to Africa, where 
they acquired slaves to transport to the southern colonies. This trian
-gular  
trade—Africa, West Indies, and North  
America—was carried 
on in violation of the Navigation Acts, but these enterprising mer
-chants 
were an
 intrepid lot and managed to get away with it. 
They 
were so succe
ssful that they soon acquired sufﬁ
cient wealth to 
displace the New En
gland Puritan elite of the earlier generation. The 
amount of money an individual acquired became the means by which an 

American 
rose to the upper class of society. This became the norm 
throughout America, not simply New En
gland. Money or property de
-termined social rank. Material goods replaced birth and heredity as the 

mo
st important component in determining one’s position in society. 
Religion had always 
been
 a prime factor in bringing settlers to 
America. Some colonies 
were actually founded as a haven for adherents 
of a par
tic 
ular creed or church. Puritans and Quakers  
were obvious 
examples. 
Puritans 
were gover
ned along congregational lines, that is, the con
-gregation formulated the rules of society and its economy. But as the 

com
mercial activity of New En
gland expanded, ministers became 
aware of the threat to their authority and sought to counteract it by 

holding synods, which spelled out doctrinal errors and demanded con
-25 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
formity in understanding the will of the Almighty. Obtaining mem
-bership in the church that would allow a male to vote and hold ofﬁ
 ce in
volved a lengthy examination to make certain an individual had a 
genuine conversion and actually experienced the presence of God. At a 
synod in 
1662 the clergy established what they called the Halfway 
Covenant by which individuals  
were granted “halfway” status if they 
were the grandchildren of “saints,” thereby conferring on them the 

right to vote and hold ofﬁ
 ce. In Quaker-
dom
inated Pennsylvania problems arose over the fact that 
Quakers refused to take oaths, insisting that oaths violated the Bible. 

This made testimony in legal disputes difﬁcult to obtain; and it com
-plicated the pledging of allegiance to the crown. Moreover, Quakers 

were paci
ﬁsts and refused to engage in warfare against the Indians. 
Over time the 
Quaker-
domination of the government in Pennsylvania 
evaporated, and William Penn’s “Holy Experiment” came to an end. 
A revival of strong religious practice occurred in America in the 
mi
ddle of the eigh
teenth century with what is known as the First Great 
Awakening. It began around the 
1720
s in New En
gland and New Jer
-sey and affected all classes of society and all regions of the country. 

Mi
nisters such as Jonathan Edwards in Northampton, Massachusetts; 
Theodorus Frelinghuysen in New Jersey; and the young George 

Whiteﬁ
 eld, who came to this country from En
gland in 
1739
, preached 
salvation to all who would repent and place their trust in Jesus Christ. 

Whiteﬁ
eld toured the colonies, mesmerizing those who heard him. He 
helped regenerate the revivalistic fervor that swept the country. In 

Philadelphia he preached to 
10,000 who  
were hungry for salvation. 
Jonathan Edwards and other revivalists, called New Lights in New 
Engla
nd, likened humans to the lowest of God’s creatures who  were 
in desperate need of salvation. In a sermon, “Sinners in the Hands of 

an Angry God,” Edwards declared, “The God that holds you over the 

pit of hell, much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over 

the ﬁ
re . . .  is dreadfully provoked.” Only His mercy stays His hand 
from allowing the wicked to fall into hellﬁ
re. But unless His creatures 
repent and desist from their sinfulness He will surely and utterly de
-stroy them. 
This Great Awakening evoked intense emotional outbursts both 
from the ministers and from those who heard them. One could hear 
26 
a short history of the united states 
“screaming, singing, laughing, praying all at once,” with people experi
-encing convulsions and falling into trances. It was not uncommon for 
an
 audience to become so aroused that it bordered on frenzy. Many of 
these preachers were itinerants and insisted that there must be a direct 

and close connection between the sinner and God, thus undermin
-ing the authority of the resident clergy. This individual and personal 

rela
tionship was necessary for salvation, they argued, not the ministra
-tion of preachers. Preachers emphasized the fact that individuals alone 

were resp
onsible for their ﬁ
nal end. Without doubt, the promotion of 
individualism was one of the important effects of the Great Awaken
-ing. Another was its antiauthoritarianism, which permanently altered 

an
d diminished the power of resident ministers in both religious and 
secular affairs. Still another important effect was that it fostered the 

founding of new colleges to provide an education which would help 

individuals achieve salvation as well as to train New Light ministers. 

Such schools as Princeton, Dartmouth, Brown, Rutgers, and Colum
-bia  
were established, and Jonathan Edwards himself became the presi
-dent of Princeton. 
By the 
1770
s, the fervor of the Great Awakening began to fade, but 
it succeeded in convincing Americans that they had a choice in religion 

and that it was up to them to earn their salvation. Such ideas carried 

into the po
liti
cal realm as well. Colonists reckoned that their govern
-ment should be grounded in the will of the people, that they had a 

cho
ice in the kind of government they wanted, the kind of government 
that suited their needs. 
The British royal 
authority in London failed to provide the 
col
onies in America with regular direction, and as the settlers moved 
farther west they encountered problems that required immediate solu
-tions. The Indians and the invading French from Canada in the west
-ern country resisted En
glish en
croachment, and so the colonists  
were obliged to attend to this problem themselves and conduct their own 

affairs without outside guidance, instruction, or contradiction. Thus 

they relied on their own assemblies to address their concerns and pass 

the necessary legislation to resolve them. Since they believed they were 

unrepresented in Parliament, they felt justiﬁ
ed in raising taxes to oper
-27 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
ate their local governments, pay the salaries of their ofﬁ
cials, and in
-crease the size of the militia to ﬁ
ght t
he Indians and ward off French 
intrusion. It was an arrangement by which England followed a policy 
of “salutary neglect,” a policy that suited the needs of the inhabitants 

and buttressed their sense of their right as Englishmen to conduct their 

own affairs. 
The problem of Indian re
sistan
ce to the constant need of colonists 
for land frequently resulted in 
all-
out war. When the Puritans moved 
into the Connecticut River valley in the 
1630
s a full-
scale conﬂ
 ict broke 
out with the Pequot in 
1637
 and resulted in the virtual extermination of 
that tribe. This was followed by King Philip’s War in 
1675
. The Indian 
chief of the Wampanoag tribe, Metacom, but dubbed King Philip by 

the British, launched a war that centered around Plymouth. This tribe 

had greeted the Pilgrims when they ﬁ
rst arrived on Cape Cod and had 
had friendly relations with the settlers. But these relations soured over 

time, and the hanging of several Wampanoag, including the brother of 

Metacom, touched off the war and soon involved many of the other 

tribes in the surrounding area. It ended with King Philip’s death in 

August 
1676
, when his severed head was put on public display. 
The Fr ench cons tit u ted 
another problem for the En
glish 
settlers. In their search for furs they had spilled down from Canada 

into the western regions beyond the Appalachian Mountains and 

around the Great Lakes. As directed by the French governor of 
Canada, 
Marquis Duquesne de Menneville, they built a series of forts from 

Lake Erie to the Ohio River to ensure their control. 
The rivalry for empire between En
gla
nd and France had already 
developed into a hundred years of warfare, starting in the late seven
-teenth century, in both Eu
ro
pe and America. It began in Eu
rope in 
1689
 with the War of the League of Augsburg, called King William’s 
War in America. In that war colonists under the command of Sir Wil
-liam Phips captured Port Royal, Nova Scotia, but it was recaptured by 

Fr
ance a year later. The War of the Spanish Succession, which started 
in 1702, was called Queen Anne’s War in the colonies. Then came the 
War of the Austrian Succession, or King George’s War, in 
1740
. At its 
conclusion France ceded Newfoundland, Arcadia, and Hudson Bay to 
28 
a short history of the united states 
Great Britain. In all these wars both the French and the En
glish a
llied 
themselves to Indian tribes, the French arming the Algonquin and the 
English the Iroquois. 
In the ﬁ
nal war of this struggle for empire, the Seven Years’ War, or 
French and Indian War, actually started in America. In 
1754
, Governor 
Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia dispatched his militia, led by a 

twenty-
two-
year-
old colonel, George Washington, to construct a fort at 
the juncture of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers that forms the 

Ohio River. Driven off the site of the junction, the Virginians built a 

stockade ﬁ
 fty miles away, called Fort Necessity. The frontier became a 
living hell for colonists in the west as the French and their Indian 
allies 
ravaged the American settlements in one military defeat after another. 
Then the situation made a complete  
about-
face. When William Pitt 
became prime minister, he completely altered British policy in ﬁghting 

this war. He left the conﬂ
ict on the Eu
ropean continent to his Prus
sian 
ally, Frederick the Great, and concentrated on the war in the colonies. 

He sent crack troops and his best generals to America, including gen
-erals James Wolfe and Jeffrey Amherst. Amherst had a reputation for 

gi
fting the Indians with 
smallpox-
infected blankets. After a series of 
engagements the French abandoned Fort Duquesne in what is now 

Pittsburgh. Louisbourg, Ticonderoga, Quebec, and Montreal  were 

captured by the British. In the siege of Quebec both General Wolfe 

and the French general, Marquis de Montcalm,  
were killed. 
At the peace treaty signed in Paris in 
176
3, France surrendered 
Canada to Great Britain. To compensate its ally, Spain, for losing 

Florida to Great Britain, France ceded Louisiana to her. The acquisi
-tion of Canada pleased fur traders because it provided an enormous 

te
rritory in which to hunt animals, and it pleased the colonists, who 
no longer feared the presence of the French and their incitement of 

Indians on the frontier. The French minister, Étienne-
François de 
Choiseul, sagaciously predicted that the colonies would break free of 

Great Britain once Canada was ceded. 
At the outset of the conﬂ
ic
t between American colonists and their 
French opponents on the frontier, particularly at Fort Duquesne, there 

was an attempt at uniﬁ
ed action. Representatives from seven  
colonies— 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New 

York, Pennsylvania, and  
Maryland—met in Albany in June 
1754
, along 
29 Discovery and Settlement of the New World  
with 
100
 Iroquois chiefs, and agreed on a Plan of 
Union for the com
-mon defense. Devised for the most part by Benjamin Franklin of 
Pe
nnsylvania, the plan recommended the creation of a continental gov
-ernment with representatives from each colony. A president-
gen
eral 
appointed by the king would act as the chief executive ofﬁ
cer with veto 
power over all legislation. The single  
house would meet annually to 
30 
a short history of the united states 
regulate such matters as Indian affairs, public lands, and a colonial 
mi
litia. This was the ﬁ
rst attempt by American settlers to form a 
continental government to act for the entire En
glish population within 
the colonies. But to Franklin’s intense disappointment, the king and 

several colonial legislatures rejected the plan. 
Because of their long history of conducting their own local affairs, 
th
e colonists believed they were merely acting on their rights as En
-glishmen. Besides, the policy of “salutary neglect” pursued by Parlia
-ment seemed to conﬁ
rm t
heir claim. They regarded their legislative 
assemblies as one expression of their right to enact laws commensurate 

with perceived local needs, not the gift of a temporarily distracted or 

overburdened Parliament. 
Parliament, of course, saw it differently. The colonists  
were Br
itish 
subjects and therefore obliged to obey the laws enacted by the central 

government in London. It was all well and good to have local assem
-blies operating in the colonies, but they 
we
re inferior to Parliament, 
which could alter or nullify what they enacted when and if it conﬂ
 icted 
with imperial needs. Such a difference of conception about their posi
-tion and rights was sure to produce a collision. And it was not long 

be
fore the collision burst into violence. 
2Indepen
dence and Nation
Building
Although the titanic
 battle for empire between the French 
and British ended with a total En
glish victory, it created monu
-mental problems in London as to the administration of this vast 
doma
in. French forces had been swept from the region west of the Al
-legheny Mountains, but thousands of Indians lived in the area and re
-sented and resisted the  ever-
inc
reasing invasion of their hunting 
grounds by En
glish colonists. The Indians also demanded that the 
British continue the French practice of supplying them with weapons 

and ammunition and lower prices on other trading necessities. The 

British had no intention of imitating French practice, and in the sum
-mer of 
1763
 th
e Indians ﬁ
 nally 
rose up, under the leadership of the Ot
-tawa chief Pontiac, in an effort to drive the settlers back to the ocean. 

Tr
ibes from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico joined the rebellion 
and destroyed every frontier fort west of the mountains. 
The British government not only decided that it must keep a stand
-ing army of at least 
10,000 tr
oops in North America to maintain order 
and control, but also issued the Proclamation of 
1763
, which forbade 
colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains. It drew a 

north- 
south line at the crest of the mountains with the idea of reserv
-ing the land west of the line for the Indians. This was meant to pacify 

th
e tribes but served only to infuriate the colonists, who refused to be 
bound by the Proclamation. 
32 
a short history of the united states 
Another problem arising from the cessation of hostilities between 
th
e British and French involved expense. The national debt in England 
stood at £
147
 million, and the Prime Minister, George Grenville, was 
determined to reduce it. One of his worst headaches was administering 
this expanded empire. It proved so costly that Parliament abandoned 

the policy of “salutary neglect” and passed a series of laws levying duties 

on En
glish imports into America, with part of the revenue to go to
-ward paying the salaries of royal ofﬁ
 ci
als in the colonies. The ﬁ
 rst bill 
was the Sugar Act, passed in 
1764
, which established duties on foreign 
sugar, textiles, coffee, indigo, rum, wine, and several other items. It 

was the ﬁ
rst law approved by Parliament intended speciﬁ
cally to raise 
money in the colonies. Grenville expected this act to yield at least 

£45,000 annually if properly enforced. The Sugar Act was not simply a 
customs duty but a program that threatened to disrupt American trade 

and the livelihood of thousands. 
This act was followed the next year by the Quartering Act, which 
requi
red the colonies to provide lodging for troops stationed in their 
communities to protect them. The Stamp Act, which came a few days 

later, added a tax stamp to be placed on newspapers, legal documents, 

contracts, playing cards, marriage licenses, land deeds, and a host of 

other items that involved paper. It was the ﬁ
rst direct tax levied by Par
-liament on the colonies. These  
acts
—the Sugar, Quartering, and Stamp 
Acts—created quite an uproar in the  
colonies—the legal class was par
-ticularly hard hit by the Stamp  
Act
—and James Otis in Massachusetts 
proposed that a general meeting of delegates from each of the colonies 

meet to take action against the Stamp Act. The proposal won a favor
-able response from the various colonies, and delegates chosen by their 

const
ituents met in October 
1765
 in New York City to protest the de
-spised legislation. All but four colonies 
were repre
sented at this Con
-gress; in a “Declaration of Rights and Grievances,” written chieﬂ
 y by 
John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, the delegates insisted that only their 
own duly elected legislatures had the right to tax them. Parliament in 

no way represented them, they insisted, and was prohibited from im
-posing taxes on them. Taxation without repre
sen
tation, they declared, 
was nothing less than tyranny. In London, Benjamin Franklin, an 

agent for Pennsylvania, warned Parliament that any attempt to enforce 

the Stamp Act with troops might lead to rebellion. 
33 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
Organizations such as the Sons of Liberty and the Daughters of 
Liberty 
were formed in 
1765
, and several riots occurred. The Sons 
of Liberty did not hesitate to resort to violence. All the stamp agents 
resigned. The violence, and the disastrous effect on merchants and 

businessmen, ﬁ
nally prompted Parliament to repeal the Stamp Act in 
1766
, but again it asserted in the Declaratory Act the government’s 
“full power and authority . . .  
to bind the colonies and people of Amer
-ica, subjects of the crown of Great Britain, in all cases whatsoever.” 
But Americans  
were so delighted that they had forced Parliament to 
repeal the Stamp Act that they simply disregarded the Declaratory 

Act. If nothing  
else, their Stamp Act Congress had demonstrated that 
by uniﬁ
ed action the colonies could compel Parliament to respect their 
rights. Let Parliament attempt another such tax, and the consequence 

might be the onset of rebellion. 
It is interesting and important that they used the word “Congress” 
to de
scribe their assembly. The word did not have the same meaning as 
it does today, namely that of a legislative body. A congress in the eigh
-teenth and nineteenth centuries usually denoted a diplomatic assembly 

of so
vereign and in
de pen
dent states. Thus the delegates to this Stamp 
Act Congress represented a collection of individual and distinct enti
-ties who considered themselves as having rights and powers as En
-glishmen by which they had full power to enact legislation for the 

ben
eﬁ
t of the people living in their respective colonies. 
In Virginia, a 
yo
ung, eloquent lawyer by the name of Patrick 
Henry, got up in the  
House of Burgesses and railed against both the 
king and Parliament. He argued so vehemently and so convincingly for 

the rights of colonists against the authority in London that someone in 

the room shouted, “Treason!” He was quick to respond, saying that if 

standing up for one’s rights is treason then the colonists should take 

advantage of it. He introduced seven resolutions denouncing the mon
-archy and Parliament. Although the Burgesses passed only four of the 

les
s extreme of them, newspapers printed all seven and distributed 
them to the other colonies. 
At this point a change in government in London brought the Chan
-cellor of the Exchequer, Charles Townshend, to the head of 
govern
ment, 
34 
a short history of the united states 
a man who rejected every argument Americans put forward regarding 
th
eir rights. To demonstrate his contempt, he persuaded  
Parliament to 
impose what he called an “external” as opposed to “internal” taxes on a 

wide variety of items to be imported from En
gland, including glass, 
paper, and tea. Worse, part of the revenue to be collected would pay the 

salaries of royal ofﬁ
cials in the colonies. Not only did these duties tax 
colonists without their consent, but they also eliminated the one lever 

of power the colonists had over their royal governors: namely, the ap
-propriation of their salaries and the salaries of their advisers and other 

ofﬁ
 cials. 
In another act the Parliament, on October 
1, 1767
, suspended the 
New York assembly for refusing to provide supplies to the troops quar
-tered in the colony. This suspension was an all- 
out a
ssault on what 
Americans regarded as their fundamental rights. Suspension could 

lead to an abolition of legislative assemblies, they contended, and result 

in virtual enslavement of the settlers. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania 

spelled out the colonists’ complaints in a pop ular pamphlet, 
Letters 
from an American Farmer
. The suspension of the New York assembly, 
he wrote, was a damnable “stroke aimed at the liberty of all these 

colonies
. . . . For the cause of one is the cause of all.” Moreover, “
Thos
e who are 
taxed
 without their own consent are 
slaves
,” he cried. “We are 
taxed without our own consent
. . . . We are  
therefore—SLAVES.” 
A new prime minister in London, Lord North, took over from 
Tow
nshend in 
1770
 and ordered the repeal of the duties, except for a tax 
of three pennies a pound on tea, which was meant more as a symbol of 

Parliament’s authority than as a producer of revenue. 
Radical activists who plotted to bring about a revolution kept stir
-ring up pop
ul
ar resentment against British rule. Sam Adams, a cousin 
of John Adams, wrote letters and articles in newspapers, summoning 

“the people of this country explicitly to declare whether they will be 

Freemen or Slaves.” He urged the formation of committees of corre
-spondence and in 
1772
 set up such committees in every Massachusetts 
town. The idea prompted Thomas Jefferson of Virginia to aid in the 

formation of similar committees throughout the colonies. 
In 1771
 Thomas Hutchinson was appointed governor of Massachu
-setts. He was not a British nobleman sent by the crown to enforce ab
-
solute control of the province. Rather, he was a  
Har
vard-
educated 
35 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
ﬁ fth-
generation American, but a devoted loyalist who had served in 
the assembly and later became chief justice of the highest Massachu
-setts court. Because Hutchinson hated and sought to quell public dem
-onstrations and mob action as a way of getting across their demands, 
Bosto
nians regarded him as the ﬁ
gurehead of everything they detested 
about British rule. And although he deplored the stupidity of the 

Stamp Act, he defended the right of Parliament to tax the colonies. 

The rage against him grew to such an extent that his  
house had been 
ransacked in 
1765
, when he was the chief justice. 
Hutchinson had also defended the use of search warrants, called 
wr
its of assistance, in an effort to curb smuggling in the colonies dur
-ing war
time. James Otis gave a  
crowd-
pleasing tirade against the writs, 
a speech so powerful that John Adams hailed it as the beginning of the 

American Revolution. “Then and there,” Adams later wrote, “the child 

Inde pen
dence was born.” 
Then, on March 
5, 1770
, the mounting antagonism between the 
British authority and the citizenry of Boston erupted in violence. Brit
-ish soldiers guarding the custom
ho
use, commanded by Captain 
Thomas Preston, 
were jeered at and heckled by agitators who threw 
stones and snowballs at them. The soldiers reacted by ﬁ
ring into the 
crowd, killing ﬁ
ve men and wounding six others. A general melee was 
avoided when Hutchinson, at the insistence of Sam Adams, agreed 

to withdraw the troops from Boston. Preston and eight of his soldiers 

were arrested and charged with murder. John Adams and Josiah 

Quincy accepted the request that they defend the soldiers. Preston and 

six of his men  
were acquitted, but two soldiers 
were found guilty of 
manslaughter and  
were released after being branded on the hand. This 
“Boston Massacre,” as it was called, was regularly remembered each 

year in Massachusetts, and a print of the bloody scene was circulated 

throughout the colonies. 
But it was the tea tax that really set off a series of events that played 
into the hands of the most radical colonial agitators. The East India 
Tea Company verged on bankruptcy and turned to the government for 

help. It had a monopoly on the importation of tea into En
gland and 
held a surplus of 
17 million pounds of tea. But it could not pay the duty 
required by law, and therefore could not sell the tea in Britain. Parlia
-ment responded in May 
177
3 by passing a Tea Act allowing the  
company 
36 
a short history of the united states 
to sell its tea in America, where the tax of threepence per pound of tea 
woul
d be collected. Under this arrangement the company could under
-sell American merchants and smugglers and create a monopoly for it
-self, a situation the colonists ﬁ
ercely re
sented. The Sons of Liberty 
condemned the act and called for a boycott of tea. 
Governor Hutchinson was determined to enforce the collection of 
th
e tax when three ships arrived in Boston with a large cargo of tea. 
His two sons and a nephew 
were among the agents assigned to sell the 
shipment. Resistance and determination reared on both sides of the 

issue. Finally, on the night of December 
16, 1773
, colonists dressed as 
Mohawk Indians boarded the ships and dumped 
342
 chests of tea 
worth £
90,000 into the harbor. 
The British reacted sharply to this “Boston Tea Party” and labeled it 
an
 act of rebellion. They chose to believe that a conspiracy had been 
hatched in Boston to initiate a rebellion against the crown and win in-

de pen
dence for the colony. Angrily, in the spring of 
1774
 Parliament 
enacted the Coercive Laws, or, as the colonists called them, the Intol
-erable Acts, by which the port of Boston was closed to all trade until 

th
e tea was paid for; it forbade town meetings; it altered the voting for 
members of the Massachusetts assembly; and it included a new quar
-tering of soldiers that applied to all colonies. Parliament had gone be
-yond simple punishment for the Tea Party, according to the colonists. 

It had n
ow abridged their fundamental freedoms as Englishmen. 
Following the Intolerable Acts came the Quebec Act, which was 
passed o
n May 
20, 1774
, and extended the boundaries of Quebec to 
include the territory west of the Allegheny Mountains. In an effort to 

conciliate 
French-
speaking Roman Catholic Canadians, Parliament 
had unwittingly roused fears among Protestant colonists about a “pop
-ish” plot to gain greater control of government. More troubling, how
-ever, was the fact that it annulled the territorial claims of New York, 

Pe
nnsylvania, Virginia, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. 
At this juncture, in August 
177
4, Thomas Jefferson published a 
pamphlet titled 
A Summary View of the Rights of British America
, in 
which he defended the Boston Tea Party as the action of a “desperate 

people” struggling to protect their basic rights as citizens. So powerful, 

so well crafted, and so direct  
were the arguments in this pamphlet that 
Jefferson overnight became the leading spokesman for colonial rights. 
37 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
In addition to all the other outrages perpetrated by the crown, 
Hutchinson was replaced as governor of Massachusetts by General 
Thomas Gage, accompanied by an army of 
4,000 soldiers, who prom
-ised to put an end to the colonists’ resistance to British law. “The die is 

ca
st,” King George informed Lord North. “The colonists must either 
triumph or submit.” 
Submit they would not. Once more delegates assembled from all the 
col
onies, except Georgia, to agree on demands and devise plans to 
make Britain acknowledge their basic rights as Englishmen. This First 

Continental Congress convened in Carpenter’s Hall in Philadelphia on 

September 
5, 1774
, and included such radical activists as Sam and John 
Adams of Massachusetts and Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee 

of Virginia. However, moderates led by Joseph Galloway of Pennsylva
-nia preferred a more conciliatory policy. They offered a variation of the 

Al
bany Plan of 
Union, but the Congress rejected it. Instead, the Con
-gress adopted a Declaration written by John Adams, which afﬁ
 rme
d the rights of colonists to “life, liberty, & property,” and condemned the 

recent acts of Parliament as “unconstitutional, dangerous, and destruc
-tive.” Again they used the word “Congress,” asserting once more their 

ex
istence as separate, individual, and sovereign states. 
Forthwith, the delegates demanded repeal of the Intolerable Acts, 
an
d of all taxes by Parliament. Moreover, they agreed to collective eco
-nomic action involving nonimportation of British goods, starting on 

Decem
ber 
1, 1774
, and nonexportation of American goods on Septem
-ber 1, 1775
. This Continental Association was to be enforced by local 
committees within each colony. When this Congress adjourned, the 

delegates truly believed that they had vindicated American rights. 

They agreed to reassemble the following May. 
But events soon developed that pitched the colonies into all- out war 
wi
th the colonial authorities. On April 
18, 1775
, General Gage in Mas
-sachusetts sent 
1,000
 tr
oops to seize suspected supplies of guns and 
ammunition at Concord. Paul Revere rode out of Boston to warn 

Americans of the approach of the soldiers. At Lexington a company of 

colonial minutemen tried to block the advance of the British and  
were ﬁred upon. Eight minutemen died in the clash. The British troops 
continued to Concord, where they destroyed what
ever weapons  
were found, and then turned around and headed back to Boston. But along 
38 
a short history of the united states 
the way they 
were at
tacked by thousands of colonists, who hid behind 
trees, bushes, and stone walls. By the time the British arrived back at 
headquarters they had lost almost 
300
 men. 
The situation escalated when Col
on
el William Prescott fortiﬁ
 ed Breed’s Hill with 
1,600 colonials on the night of June 
16, 1775
, and 
General Gage sent his army to dislodge them. It took three assaults 

and the loss of over 
1,000
 men before the British ﬁ
nally reached the 
trenches at the top of the hill where the Americans  
were hidden. Their 
powder gone, the colonials abandoned the trenches and ﬂ
 ed from 
their attackers. They suffered about  one-
third as many casualties as 
they inﬂ
icted on the British, who lost over 
1,000 men. 
This Battle of Bunker Hill, incorrectly named after a hill nearby, 
was one of the bloodiest in the entire Revolutionary War. One- eighth 
of all the British ofﬁ
cers who died in the war  
were killed at Bunker 
Hill. General Henry Clinton,  
who—together with Generals William 
Howe and John 
Burgoyne—had recently arrived in Boston with rein
-forcements, wrote a ﬁ
tt
ing comment on this battle: “Another such vic
-tory would have ruined us.” 
With violence increasing each month, the Second Continental Con
-gress assembled on May 
10, 1775, and decided to pursue more radical 
mea
sures in seeking redress of grievances. The delegates raised an army, 
appointed General George Washington to command it, issued Conti
-nental currency, and opened negotiations with foreign powers to win 

th
eir support and intervention. 
To subdue this rebellion, the British hired 
20,000 Ger
man merce
-naries and shipped them to America, thereby intensifying Americans’ 

determ
ination to seek inde
pen
dence. The publication of 
Common Sense 
by Thomas Paine in early January 
1776
, called for immediate in
de pen
-dence. He labeled George III the “Royal Brute” and accused the king 

of i
nstigating all the wretched legislation directed against the colonists. 
Paine acknowledged that many Americans looked upon Britain as the 

“parent country,” but if true, he said, the recent acts 
were all the more 
outrageous: “Even brutes do not devour their young, nor savages make 

war upon their families.” But the “Royal Brute” could and did “un
-ﬂinchingly hear of their slaughter, and composedly slept with their 
blood upon his soul.” America was destined for a republican form of 
government, Paine insisted, not a “monarchical tyranny.” It has been 
39 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
and will continue to be “the asylum for the persecuted lovers of civil 
and religious liberty from 
every part
 of Eu
rope.” Paine’s pamphlet had 
such an impact on those who read it that it persuaded many to adopt 

the cause of in
de pen
dence. More than 
100
,000 copies of the pamphlet 
were snapped up by an eager public, and the work enjoyed  
twenty-
ﬁ ve printings in 
1776
 alone. George Washington referred frequently to its 
“sound doctrine and unanswerable reasoning.” 
On April 
12, 177
6, North Carolina instructed its delegates in Con
-gress to seek separation, and on June 
7 Richard Henry Lee of Virginia 
offered a resolution stating that these colonies “are and of right ought 

to be, free and in
de pen
dent states.” John Adams seconded Lee’s resolu
-tion, but there  
were som
e in Congress who argued for reconciliation 
with the mother country. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania reminded 

them, however, that if the members of the Congress did not “hang 
Westward Expansion
40 
a short history of the united states 
together,” they would “all hang separately.” Ultimately the advocates of 
inde pen
dence prevailed. As Jefferson explained, “The question was not 
whether, by a declaration of in
de pen
dence, we should make ourselves 
what we are not, but whether we should declare a fact that already  
exists.” 
A committee was formed to write a justiﬁ
ca
tion of the action to be 
taken should Congress choose to accept the resolution. Thomas Jef
-ferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman of Connecti
-cut, and Robert R. Livingston of New York composed this committee, 

bu
t a  subcommittee of Jefferson and Adams was actually assigned the 
task of writing the document. Because Jefferson was known to be a 

“felicitous” writer, he was prevailed upon to prepare what turned out to 

be an eloquent statement about human liberty and equality. Adams 

and Franklin added some minor amendments. On July 
2 Lee’s resolu
-tion was passed, and on July 
4 the Declaration of In
de pen
dence was 
adopted without dissent and signed by the president of the Continental 

Congress, John Hancock. 
The Congress also adopted a ﬂ
ag
, on June 
14, 1777,
 one consisting of 
thirteen red and white alternating stripes and thirteen white stars on a 

ﬁeld of blue. 
As delegates from sovereign, in
de pen
dent states, the members  
were united in their determination to win freedom from the tyranny of 

Great Britain, but they had little enthusiasm for creating a controlling 

central government. Still, they needed some sort of central authority to 

attend to such matters as providing for military and ﬁ
 nancial needs in 
prosecuting the ongoing war. So another committee was chosen to lay 

out the speciﬁ
cs for a national government that could address these 
concerns. The document produced by this committee, known as the 

Articles of Confederation, was chieﬂy the work of John Dickinson of 

Pennsylvania. What the document proposed was a Confederation of 

states, not a  
Union of people. As a result, the government it projected 
was doomed from the start. Nevertheless, it was a major  breakthrough 

in the evolution of a representative government that would encompass 

a collection of thirteen in
de pen
dent po
liti
cal entities. 
The Articles declared that the several states  
were to be joined in a 
“perpetual 
union” and a “ﬁ
 rm league of friendship.” But it also admit
-ted that all the states would retain their “sovereignty, freedom, and in-

de pen
dence.” A unicameral legislature was established for this “union,” 
41 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
representing all the states. And although it could enact laws, it had no 
authority to enforce them. It relied on the states and the people to obey 

what
ever it decreed, but voluntary compliance proved to be virtually 
impossible. In addition, the government lacked the power to tax. To 

support its operation and pay for carry
ing on the war, it had to rely on 
contributions from each state as set forth by the national legislature. 

But few states paid what they owed. If hard-
pressed for cash, they 
would pay less, and there was nothing the central government could do 

about it. 
Two other problems  
were present in the Articles. First, the unani
-mous agreement of all the states was required before the document 

coul
d go into effect. Mary
land withheld its consent until all the states 
ceded their western lands to the central government. That state had no 

claim to the western country and hoped to share in the largess of more 

fortunate states, such as Virginia. Not until 
1781
 did all the states agree 
to the condition and Mary
land ﬁ
nally added its consent. The second 
problem involved amending the Articles once the government began 

operation. Again it required unanimous approval by the states, and 

that proved to be impossible. What the document created was a gov
-ernment subservient to thirteen other governments. 
It must be remembered that at the time, the delegates who produced 
the Articles of Confederation had no experience in establishing a work
-able central authority that would understand and recognize the sover
-eignty of each state. It would take a learning experience of almost half 

a doz
en years for others to decide what had to be done to create a per
-manent 
Union that could pass and enforce laws to protect liberty and 

prope
rty for its citizens and show proper regard for the rights of the 
states. In a word, a federal system needed to be erected. 
The delegates debated the Articles of Confederation for over a year, 
an
d not until November 
15, 1777
, was it formally adopted. Then, it took 
another three and a half years before all the states agreed and the gov
-
ernment under the Articles was established. 
The war itself 
had begu
n at Lexington and Concord, but to put 
down the rebellion the British had to destroy General Washington’s 
ability to remain in the ﬁ
eld or militarily occupy the entire country. 
42 
a short history of the united states 
The rebels, on the other hand, simply had to get the British to tire of 
th
e war and withdraw. They did not need to win battle after battle. If 
they could maintain an army in the ﬁ
eld over an extended period of 
time, it was very likely that they could obtain their objective. 
On July 
12, 177
6, the British sent reinforcements to New York to link 
up with Sir William Howe’s army, which came down from Halifax. 

They rendezvoused with other British troops from South Carolina 

under General Henry Clinton to constitute a powerful force of 
30,000 soldiers. Washington had less than half that number and realized he 

could never hold New York. Still he was determined to put up a ﬁ
 ght. 
On August 
27 he challenged the British on Long Island. Following an 
inevitable defeat, he moved his army under cover of a thick fog across 

the East River to Manhattan. Howe pursued him up the Hudson River 

valley, and Washington retreated to New Jersey. New York remained in 

British hands for the remainder of the war. 
Washington crossed the Delaware River at Trenton and tried to 
keep his army together. But his soldiers shivered in the December cold 
and began to desert, since the situation looked hopeless. Their general 

pleaded with Congress to provide supplies and additional troops but 

had little success. As the situation became desperate, Thomas Paine, 

from an American camp, wrote the ﬁrst number of 
The Crisis
, in which 
he declared, “These are the times that try men’s souls.” Indeed, Wash
-ington himself almost lost hope. “If every nerve is not strained to re
-cruit a new army,” he wrote, “I think the game is pretty well up.” 
Then he attempted something truly daring. On Christmas eve 
ning, with about 
2,500
 men, he crossed the  ice-
ﬁlled Delaware River about 
nine miles northwest of Trenton and attacked the Hessians who had 

taken the town and  
were sleeping off their Christmas celebration. The 
Americans captured more than 
900 Hessians. Lord Cornwallis at
-tempted to strike back, but Washington hit the British rear guard at 

Pri
nceton and forced Cornwallis to retreat to protect his military sup
-plies. What Washington had done by his daring action was restore his 

arm
y’s conﬁ
dence that it could win and spike the determination of the 
British to bring the war to a speedy end. 
Resolved as ever to put down the rebellion, the British came up 
wi
th a 
three-
pronged plan. They would bring down two separate 
armies from Canada, which would meet in Albany and then join a 
43 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
force sent northward by General Howe in New York, thereby cutting 
off New En
gland. Cutting off New En
gland was an important ob
jec
-tive for the British. But the army marching down from the St. Law
-rence via Lake Champlain and commanded by General John Burgoyne 

wa
s surrounded by thousands of Americans from Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, and New York led by General Horatio Gates. Recognizing 

the hopelessness of his situation, Burgoyne surrendered his army of 

6,000 at Saratoga on October 
17, 1777
. It was quite a disaster for the British and prompted the French to 
co
nclude that an alliance with the United States would be to their ad
-vantage. On February 
6, 177
8, American ministers, led by Benjamin 
Franklin, signed two treaties with the French government. The ﬁ
 rst 
was a treaty of amity and commerce in which both countries 
were granted  
most-
favored-
nation status; they further agreed to guarantee 
forever each other’s possessions in the New World. The second was a 

treaty of alliance whereby neither country would lay down its arms 

until Great Britain acknowledged the in
de pen
dence of the United 
States; this second treaty was to become effective when war broke out 

between France and Britain. 
The surrender at Saratoga also convinced Lord North and King 
George to make concessions, and a bill was introduced in Parliament 
that granted virtually all the Americans’ demands, to wit: Parliament 

would not levy any tax on the colonies; all unacceptable laws enacted 

since 
1763
 would be repealed; and leaders branded as rebels would be 
pardoned. But the bill did not win passage until nearly two weeks after 

the alliances with France had been signed, and the Americans had no 

wish to revert from free states back to dependent colonies. On June 
17 France and Britain clashed on the open sea and war was declared  between 

them. That spring Count Charles d’Estaing, commanding twelve 

French warships and several regiments of troops, headed for America. 
Meanwhile, Howe took part of his army and headed south to cap
-ture Philadelphia, apparently with the approval of London. Washing
-ton hastened to thwart the British move but was outﬂanked at the 

battles of Brandywine Creek and Germantown. So while Howe spent 
the winter in the city enjoying a life of parties and dances, Washington 

took up a position at Valley Forge, twenty miles northwest of Philadel
-phia, where he and his men, numbering 
12,000, end
ured a dreadful 
44 
a short history of the united states 
winter. Men and camp followers sickened and died from lack of proper 
shel
ter, food, clothing, blankets, and medicine. Again the general 
begged for assistance from Congress but received very little. 
General Clinton took command in place of Howe and decided to 
retu
rn to New York. Washington followed and met the British at Mon
-mouth, New Jersey, on June 
28, 177
8,
 where he managed to turn back 
Clinton’s counterattack. It was the last battle that Washington directed 

prior to his assuming command of a combined French and American 

force at Yorktown in Virginia. 
The French had planned all along that the ﬂ
ee
t under d’Estaing 
would head for the West Indies in the hope of capturing several British 

islands, such as Jamaica or one of the sugar islands. The Americans 

had little naval might to challenge the British ﬂ
eet patrolling the 

coastline, but one American ship, commanded by John Paul Jones, 

captured several hundred British vessels and raided a number of En
-glish coastal towns. Jones himself became something of an American 

he
ro in this war. The country needed heroes, and there  
were so few. 
Then, when Spain entered the war against Great Britain in the ex
-pectation of recapturing Gibraltar and Florida, the ministry in London 

deci
ded to change its strategy and shift the war to the southern Amer
-ican colonies. It began with the capture of Savannah in December 
177
8. General Clinton sailed from New York with an army of 
8,500
; cap
-tured Charleston; and compelled the American general, Benjamin 

Lin
coln, to surrender his army of over 
5,000. Lord Cornwallis replaced 
Clinton, who returned to New York, while Congress appointed Gen
-eral Gates to supersede Lincoln. Gates’s appointment was a mistake. 

He su
ffered the worst American defeat of the war at Camden, South 
Carolina, when his troops ﬂ
ed the ﬁ
eld in disarray. Gates ran too. The 
British then came to a very wrong  
conclusion—that untrained, undis
-ciplined American soldiers would drop their weapons and ﬂ
 ee 
when 
confronted by professional British troops. 
Another disaster occurred on September 
25, when Ben
edict Arnold, 
a splendid general who had participated in the surrender of Burgoyne 

at Saratoga, turned traitor and deserted to the British. In need of 

money to pay his many debts, he agreed to turn over West Point, which 

he commanded, to the enemy. It turned out that he had been spying for 

General Clinton for the past year. The capture of Major John André, 
45 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
who carried messages between Clinton and Arnold, revealed the trea
-son. Arnold ﬂ
ed. He later became a British general and joined Lord 
Co
rnwallis, who had moved his army from the Carolinas into Virginia, 
where he took up a position at Yorktown. 
The urgent call to the French for help resulted in the arrival of 
7,000 me
n aboard a ﬂ
eet of twenty warships commanded by Admiral Fran
-çois de Grasse. The combined  Franco-
Ame
rican army of 
16,000 under 
Washington’s command surrounded Cornwallis while de Grasse’s ﬂ
 eet blocked the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, thus preventing the British 

from escaping the net that had been tightly wound around them. On 

October 
18, 1781
, the British general surrendered his army of 
8,000 regulars and sailors. 
For all intents and purposes the American colonies had won their 
inde pen
dence. The  
House of Commons in London voted to end the 
war and authorized a negotiating team to arrange a peace treaty with 

the former colonies. Lord North resigned and was succeeded by Lord 

Rockingham. A year later, on November 
30, a provisional treaty was 
signed in Paris by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, John Jay, and 

Henry Laurens for the United States. Commissioner Richard Oswald 

signed for Britain. On April 
15, 1783,
 Congress ratiﬁ
ed the treaty. Ac
-cording to the terms of this treaty U.S. in
de pen
dence was recognized, 
and its boundaries  
stipulated—although the treaty failed to include the 
cession of Canada to the United States as demanded by Franklin. The 

boundaries ran from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River and 

from the 
forty-
ﬁfth parallel in the south to Maine and the Great Lakes 
in the north. The treaty also called for the cessation of hostilities and 

the evacuation of 
British-
held territory within the United States. In ad
-dition it provided ﬁ
shi
ng rights for Americans, and that the rights and 
property of loyalists would be restored. It was a very generous treaty as 

far as the former colonists  
were concerned. The French bitterly criti
-cized it because they had not been consulted in arranging the terms. A 

di
plomatic response from Franklin soothed the hurt feelings of the 
French and prevented the two allies from breaking off relations. 
The ne x t sev er a l 
years 
were di
fﬁ
cult for the United States. 
Individual states quarreled with one another and with the central 
46 
a short history of the united states 
government. Boundaries between states  were one problem; commerce, 
debt
s, and currency 
were others. To make matters worse, a rebellion 
ﬂared in Massachusetts when eco
nomical
ly depressed farmers de
-manded laws to protect them against farm foreclosures and cheap 

money
. When 
violence resulted, Governor James Bowdoin called out 
the militia to restore order. But Daniel Shays, an ofﬁ
cer during the 
Revolution, assembled a force of 
1,200
 men in the late fall of 
1786
 and 
marched on the town of Springﬁ
eld. After several engagements, the 
militia, commanded by General Benjamin Lincoln, crushed the rebel
-lion by March 
1787
. Shays himself ﬂ
ed to Vermont and was later par
-doned. The government under the Articles of Confederation did 

no
thing to help the Massachusetts authority despite the fact that Con
-gress authorized the Secretary of War, Henry Knox, to raise a 

1,000-ma
n force to ﬁ
 ght. 
There  
were a fe
w bright spots during this period of the Confedera
-tion. In Virginia on January 
16, 1786
, the  
House of Burgesses adopted a 
statute of religious freedom, written by Thomas Jefferson. It declared 

that no one could be compelled to join or support a church or suffer 

discrimination on account of religious beliefs. Jefferson ranked his au
-thorship of this act along with his writing of the Declaration of In
de-pen
dence and the founding of the University of Virginia as his most 
signiﬁ
cant contributions as a public ofﬁ
 cial. 
But nationally, things went from bad to worse. Topping off the 
pr
oblems for the central government was an economic recession that 
lingered for several years during the 
1780
s. Trade and wages declined, 
and paper currency issued by the several states mounted to nearly $
1 million and its value steadily declined. Some people began to consider 

amending the Articles but quickly realized what an impossible task it 

would be. 
Congress, however, did enjoy one notable success under the Articles. 
On Ju
ly 13, 1787
, it passed the Northwest Ordinance, a scheme by which 
future states could be added to the  
Union. The Ordinance provided a 
government for the territory north of the Ohio River which had been 

ceded by New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Virginia. On the 

basis of a plan devised in 
1784
 by Thomas Jefferson, the western region 
would be surveyed and laid out in townships, 
six-mile- 
square with 
47 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
parcels set aside for education. The area was placed under the control of 
a governor, a secretary, and three judges appointed by Congress. When 

the number of adult white males in the area reached 
5,000, they could 
elect a bicameral legislature and send a  
non-
voting delegate to Con
-gress. Once the number reached 
60,000, th
ey could apply for admis
-sion as a state on an equal basis with all the other states. Freedom of 

relig
ion, trial by jury, and support for public education 
were guaran
-teed. Slavery was prohibited. It was expected that three to ﬁ
 ve sta
tes 
would be created out of this Northwest Territory. Later, the Congress 

under the Constitution adopted the procedure formulated by the 

Northwest Ordinance, a pro 
cess that settled once and for all the method 
by which new states could be joined to the  
Union. 
But the problems confronting Congress under the Articles grew 
wor
se with each passing year, and many Americans recognized that 
something had to be done. A start in that direction occurred when 

Virginia and Mary
land met at Mount Vernon in 
1785
 to address the 
question of interstate commerce, in partic
ular the navigation of the 
Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River. It soon developed that Dela
-ware and Pennsylvania also had an interest in the problem and wanted 

to ta
ke part in the negotiations. Whereupon Virginia invited all the 
states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland, in 
1786
 to see if they 
could ﬁ
nd a solution to the problem of interstate commerce. Nine states 
accepted the invitation, although only ﬁ
ve (New York, New Jersey, 
Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) showed up in time to take part 

in the proceedings. So Alexander Hamilton of New York suggested 

that they attempt something far more comprehensive than interstate 

commerce. He wrote a report, adopted by the convention, in which he 

proposed that the delegates invite the several states to send representa
-tives to attend a special convention in Philadelphia in 
1787 for the 
purpose of devising such “provisions as shall appear to them necessary 

to render the constitution of the Federal Government adequate to the 

exigencies of the 
Union.” Put another way, he wanted the Articles 
thoroughly overhauled to create a truly workable central government 

with genuine powers that it could enforce. 
The Congress under the Articles added its recommendation to the 
pr
oposal that the delegates had issued and called on the states to 
appoint 
48 
a short history of the united states 
delegates to the convention in Philadelphia “for the sole and express 
pur
pose of revising the Articles of Confederation.” 
All the states 
except Rhode Island responded, and dispatched a 

to
tal of 
ﬁ fty-
ﬁve representatives to this new convention, which met in 
May 
1787
. From this turnout it was clear that most states realized 
something had to be done if the  Union was to last. Not surprisingly, a 

number of notables attended. First and foremost was General George 

Washington, who by this time had achieved the status of a national 

hero and whose presence lent a high degree of legitimacy to the meet
-ing. Others included James Madison of Virginia, who would provide 

th
e basic frame for a totally new government; and Alexander Hamil
-ton, who argued effectively for a stronger and more potent national 

gover
nment. Still other distinguished members included Gouverneur 
Morris and James Wilson of Pennsylvania, Roger Sherman and El-

bridge Gerry of Massachusetts, and George Mason and Edmund 

Randolph of Virginia. William Jackson of Georgia was elected to serve 

as secretary, but his journal is so substantively thin that it provides little 

information about what took place at the convention. Fortunately James 

Madison kept extensive notes, which  
were published in 
1840
, shortly 
after his death. 
The ﬁ
rst thing the convention did was unanimously elect George 
Washington president. Next, the members decided to keep their debates 
secret, as most colonial assemblies did. They agreed on secrecy for the 

simple reason that they decided, at the start of their deliberations, to 

scrap the Articles and write an entirely new document. Had this decision 

been known, several states might well have recalled their delegations. 
Once the convention began its serious work, Governor Edmund 
Ra
ndolph of Virginia introduced, on May 
29, a suggested form of gov
-ernment prepared by Madison and based on the people rather than on 

th
e states. This “Virginia Plan” or “Large State Plan,” as it was called, 
established a government consisting of three in
de pen
dent  
branches— 
legislative, executive, and  
judicial—in which each would have certain 
powers and could check the others. Checks and balances 
were the ideal 
it hoped to create. Congress, the legislative  
branch—which the found
-ers regarded as the centerpiece of government—consisted of two 
49 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
houses. The lower  
house (elected every two years by the people) would 
be proportional to population and would elect the members of the up
-per  
house from nominations put forward by individual states. This 
proposal conferred broad legislative powers on the Congress and could 
annul state law, a feature that generated immediate criticism. The leg
-islature would also choose the executive, as well as the judiciary, which 
woul
d include a supreme court and such inferior courts as necessary. 
Finally, a council of revision composed of the executive and members 

of the judiciary would exercise a veto over legislative acts. 
The Virginia Plan obviously favored the states with the largest pop
-ulation, a fact that troubled small states. Their delegates preferred a 

di
fferent proposal, the one put forward by William Paterson of New 
Jersey on June 
15 and known as the “New Jersey Plan” or “Small State 
Plan.” This proposal imitated the Articles in that it called for a uni
-cameral legislature in which each state would have one vote. The state 

govern
ments, not the people, would elect the representatives to this 
Congress and choose a plural executive and a supreme court. The ex
-ecutive would not have veto power. Although the New Jersey Plan 

gr
anted the government additional authority to tax and regulate for
-eign and interstate trade and included a statement that the laws of 

Co
ngress would be the supreme law of the country, it was hardly more 
than a slight modiﬁ
cation of the Articles which everyone knew had 
proved unworkable. The Virginia Plan, on the other hand, was too 

lopsided in favoring a proportional system of repre
senta
tion, but it did 
provide for an entirely new and innovative form of government. 
Some members of this convention actually preferred nothing more 
than
 a set of amendments to the Articles of Confederation, as difﬁ
 cult 
as that might be. They did not want to participate in any way in the 

diminution of states’ power and rights, and in the case of several mem
-bers, like Governor George Clinton of New York, their own individual 

au
thority. Clinton and several others withdrew from the convention 
when they realized that their position found little favor with the other 

delegates. 
The members of the convention spent days arguing and debating 
th
e two proposals; and since they were genuinely interested in resolv
-ing the governmental problems that beset the  
coun
try—speciﬁ
 cally, 
maintaining viable states and a strong central 
authority—they ﬁ
 nally 
50 
a short history of the united states 
resorted to compromise to bring about a solution. When there are 
op
posing views to any problem, let alone a set of problems, they agreed, 
the only way to resolve them is through compromise. To reach an 

agreement, both large and small states had to yield something to the 

other side in order to gain what they felt was important for their par
tic
-ular requirements. 
To break the impasse, Roger Sherman of Connecticut suggested 
what ha
s been called the Connecticut Compromise: that is, a Congress 
consisting of two  
houses, in which the lower  house would be elected 
by the people on the basis of population, thereby satisfying the large 

states, and the upper  
house would be elected by the states with each 
state having two representatives, thus providing equality of repre sen
ta-tion and thereby meeting the demand of the small states. Further com
-promises included counting  
thre
e-
ﬁfths of the slave population in 
determining the population for a state’s repre
senta
tion in the lower 
house. And there was to be no interference with the slave trade for 

twenty years. The convention also agreed to permit Congress to regu
-late trade, as the North demanded, but forbade the imposition of ex
-port duties, which the South insisted upon to protect its exports of 

cot
ton and tobacco. 
These various compromises  
were adop
ted toward the end of July and 
then submitted to a  
ﬁ ve-member committee of detail to draft the com
-pleted Constitution. The committee ﬁ
nish
ed its work and submitted 
the result to the convention on August 
6. After a monthlong debate the 
delegates agreed on a  
two-
year term for representatives, a  six-
year term 
for senators, and a  
four-
year term for the chief executive. States 
were forbidden to issue paper money or infringe on the obligation of con
-tracts. The document went on at length in describing the powers del
-egated to Congress but said little about the other two branches. It 

obvi
ously meant to imply that the legislature would attend to the needs 
of the executive and judiciary. What it did say about the other two 

branches was the manner in which the President would be elected (by 

a College of Electors chosen in each state) and the justices appointed. 

It awarded the chief executive veto and appointive powers, and the 

position of commander in chief of the armed forces. It also decreed the 

establishment of a Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress 

would from time to time establish. It prohibited bills of attainder and 
51 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
ex post facto laws. It further stipulated that the members of the three 
branches of government would receive compensation from the national 

trea
sury, not from the states. 
Having agreed substantially to the important segments of this fed
-eral government, the convention appointed a  
ﬁ ve-man co
mmittee on 
style and arrangement to prepare the ﬁ
nal document. Principally 
written by Gouverneur Morris, the draft included a preamble that 

declared, “We the people of the United States” establish this 

Constitution—not “we the states” as stated in the Articles of Confed
-eration. The preamble went on to identify the objectives of this new 

gover
nment: to “form a more perfect  
Union, establish Justice, insure 
domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the 

general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and 

our Posterity.” The document also stated that the Constitution, the 

treaties, and the laws of the United States “shall be the supreme Law 

of the Land.” 
This draft was submitted to the convention on September 
12 and 
reviewed at length. After a few minor changes each of the twelve state 
delegations voted to approve the Constitution on September 
17, 1787
. Of the 
forty-
two members present, three refused to sign the ﬁ
 nal 
copy: Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, and Edmund Randolph and 

George Mason of Virginia. The signed document then went forth 

with a letter of recommendation to the Congress under the Articles 

that the states call special conventions elected by the people to approve 

or reject the instrument. When nine states ratiﬁ
ed it, the Constitution 
would replace the Articles of Confederation and go into effect in those 

states. 
Delaware was the ﬁ
rst state to give its approval to the new docu
-ment, on December 
7, by a un
animous vote. It was followed by Pennsyl
-vania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, 

So
uth Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, and New York. The ap
-proval by New York on July 
26 pr
ovided the eleventh state to ratify, but 
Rhode Island rejected the Constitution and North Carolina delayed its 

approval until November 
21, 1789
. Rhode Island subsequently reversed 
itself and ratiﬁ
ed the document on May 
29, 1790
. During the debates 
in the ratifying conventions there  
were many complaints about the 
Constitution’s failure to provide a bill of rights, especially a statement 
52 
a short history of the united states 
that those powers not expressly granted to the national government 
were reser
ved to the states. A number of states made recommendations 
that this deﬁ
ciency be addressed as soon as possible. 
Once the ratiﬁ
 ca
tion by eleven states had been achieved in July, the 
Congress under the Articles of Confederation decreed that on the ﬁrst 

Wednesday of January 
1789
, electors would be chosen in the several 
states who would vote for President and Vice President; that on the 

ﬁrst Wednesday of February 
1789
 those electors would cast their bal
-lots; and on the ﬁ
rst W
ednesday of March 
1789
—which happened to 
be March 
4, a date that would mark the beginning of each new admin
-istration until passage of the Twentieth Amendment on February 
6, 1933, when i
t was changed to January 
20—the newly elected Congress 
would assemble in New York City, the seat of the American govern
-ment since 
178
5, tabulate the ballots, and announce the names of the 
chosen President and Vice President, thereby completing the election 

of the legislative and executive branches. Once the individuals of these 

two branches assembled, they could then begin the pro 
cess of estab
-lishing the judiciary and name the individuals who would sit on the 

Sup
reme Court. 
There was virtually no question as to who would be elected Presi
-dent. George Washington was universally loved as the military hero 

who had wo
n the nation’s freedom. Without him no Union seemed 
possible. So the electors unanimously elected him chief executive 

and John Adams Vice President. Coming from Massachusetts, Adams 

provided a good balance to Washington, a  Virginian—thus both North 

and South  
were represented in the executive  branch—and his career as 
a public servant and his contributions in the struggle for in
de pen
dence placed him in the front ranks of American statesmen. He was among 

the members who had negotiated the treaty that ended the Revolution, 

and he had represented the new nation at various times in France, Hol
-land, and En
gland. 
When these two men  
were no
tiﬁ
ed of their election, Adams hurried 
immediately to New York, but Washington endured an 
eight-
day tri
-umphal march from his home in Mount Vernon through Philadelphia 

an
d New Jersey to New York City, where on April 
30, 1789
, he was in
-augurated with as much pomp as beﬁ
tt
ed this incomparable hero. He 
rode to Federal Hall in a yellow carriage drawn by six white  
horses and 
53 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
attended by four footmen in livery. Members of Congress marched 
behind, along with the New York militia. Washington was dressed in a 

suit with silver buttons embossed with ea
gles, and he wore white silk 
stockings and pumps with silver buckles. Strapped around his waist 

was a ceremonial sword.  
Thin-
lipped and tall, with a prominent Ro
-man nose, the most distinguishing feature of his slightly pockmarked 

face, h
e both looked and acted presidential. 
Washington was sworn into ofﬁ
ce
 by Chancellor Robert R. Livings
-ton, the highest legal ofﬁ
cer of N
ew York, as he stood on the open gal
-lery of the second ﬂ
oor of Federal Hall so that an adoring crowd outside 

coul
d see and applaud him. To deliver his inaugural address, an address 
composed in large mea
sure by James Madison, he returned to the ad
-joining chamber, where he told the assembled members of Congress 

tha
t he had been “summoned” to the presidential ofﬁ
ce “by my country, 
whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love.” He then 

spoke in general terms about virtue and duty and the need for providen
-tial guidance. He also called for the passage of a bill of rights as amend
-ments to the Constitution, thereby acknowledging the many complaints 

he
ard during the debates in several state ratifying conventions. Madison 
had resisted such a bill in the Constitutional Convention, since the pro
-posed government enjoyed only delegated powers and therefore would 

no
t concern itself with personal rights. But he subsequently learned 
from his constituents that they felt such a bill was absolutely necessary 

for inclusion in the Constitution for the protection of their rights. 
When the ceremony ended the President walked to Saint Paul’s 
Ch
apel, a short distance away, where the Episcopal bishop invoked di
-vine blessing on this new administration and government. One repre
-sentative, Henry Wynkoop of Pennsylvania, said, “The Rooff is now 

ra
ised & the federal Ediﬁ
ce compleated.” A  
Union of states and people 
had now been accomplished. But would it endure? 
The first Congress 
under the Constitution completed a number 
of
 important actions that made it one of the most productive in the 
entire history of the United States. First of all, it raised revenue; estab
-lished the executive departments of State, Trea
sur
y, and War; created 
the federal judiciary system; and passed a Bill of Rights. President 
54 
a short history of the united states 
Washington chose Thomas Jefferson to head the State Department, 
Al
exander Hamilton the Trea
sury, and Henry Knox the War Depart
-ment. The Judiciary Act of 
1789
 orga
nized a Supreme Court with a 
chief  justice and ﬁ
ve associates; three circuit courts of appeal; and thir
-teen district courts. It also established the ofﬁ
ce
 of attorney general. 
John Jay was named the ﬁ
rst chief justice, and Edmund Randolph the 
attorney general. All this in just six months, from April to September 

1789
. At the insistence of James Madison, the  
Hou
se agreed to seventeen 
amendments to the Constitution. They mostly dealt with personal 

liberties and forbade the government to legislate on any of these. The 

liberties involved basic freedoms such as speech, press, religion, the 

rights of assembly and petition, and the right to bear arms. The amend
-ments also guaranteed a fair trial for the accused, and speciﬁ
 cal
ly stated 
that those powers not delegated by the Constitution to the national 

government  
were reserved to the “States respectively, or to the people.” 
In the Senate, through combinations and  
deleti
ons—a guarantee of 
protection of the right of conscience and a statement on the separation 

of powers 
were deleted—the number of amendments was reduced to 
twelve and passed. Madison wanted these amendments woven into the 

text of the Constitution, with a preface that would emphasize the sov
-
ereignty of the people and proclaim the principles of republican gov
-ernment. But Roger Sherman proposed that the amendments be 

gro
uped together at the end of the Constitution. In this form Congress 
would create an actual “Bill of Rights.” 
On September 
28, th
e amendments 
were submitted to the states for 
ratiﬁ
cation. Not until December 
15, 1791
, did the states ratify ten of the 
twelve. Amendments regarding congressional salaries and the appor
-tionment of 
Ho
use seats failed to pass, although the amendment on 
salaries was approved in 
1992
 as the  
Twenty-
Seventh Amendment to 
the Constitution. It declared that compensation to members of Con
-gress, whether increased or decreased, shall not take effect until an 

elect
ion of Representatives shall have intervened. 
The ﬁ
rst sign of real trouble in the new government developed when 
the secretary of the trea
sury, Hamilton, issued a series of reports on 
the public credit. He proposed that the national debt, which stood at 

$54,124,464
.56, be funded at par, part of which, running to $
11,710,378
, 56 
a short history of the united states 
was owed to foreigners, mostly French and Dutch. Hamilton also 
ca
lled for the assumption of state debts by the federal government. The 
assumption of state debts was intended to attract the loyalty and sup
-port of business and commercial interests toward the central govern
-ment. There was little if any opposition to funding the national debt, 

al
though James Madison did suggest that allowances be made for the 
original holders of the debt who had sold their shares to speculators, a 

suggestion that was rejected. But the assumption of state debts trig
-gered ﬁerce opposition by those states, like Virginia, that had paid part 
or almost all of their debt by selling their western land. These states 
felt they 
were being penalized in having to contribute toward paying 
off the debts of other states in addition to having paid off their own. 

The New En
gland states, on the other hand, had amassed heavy debts 
during the war and generally favored Hamilton’s plan of assumption. 
But on April 
12, af
ter a protracted debate, the  House of Representa
-tives rejected assumption by a vote of thirty-
on
e to 
twenty-
nine. The 
friends of Hamilton 
were visibly shocked by the outcome, their faces 
“reddened like Scarlet . . .  
or [turned] deadly White.” Theodore Sedg
-wick of Massachusetts took the ﬂ
oor a
nd denounced the action. The 
people of his state had “implored” Congress to “relieve us from the pres
-sure of intolerable  
bu
rdens—burdens incurred in support of your free
-dom and in
de pen
dence.” Is this the way it is repaid? 
Hamilton turned to Jefferson for help. He insisted that assumption 
mu
st go forward, and if Jefferson could persuade a few of his friends to 
change their vote, Hamilton would help in ﬁxing the permanent capi
-tal of the country in the South, as many southerners decidedly desired. 

Je
fferson held a dinner party attended by both Hamilton and Madison, 
and the  
so-called Compromise of 
1790
 was concluded. As a result the 
House reversed itself and voted  
thirty-
four to 
twenty-
eight to adopt 
the assumption plan, and on July 
10 the site of the new capital was 
transferred from New York to a  
ten-
mile square along the Potomac 
River in Mary
land. This capital would be called Washington in honor 
of the ﬁ
rst President, and the district would be named Columbia after 
one of the symbols regularly used to represent the United States. The 

government would move from New York to Philadelphia while this 

new capital was being built and would remain there for ten years. 
Another issue that stirred controversy was a request by Hamilton 
57 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
on December 
13, 1790
, that Congress charter a central banking system 
for twenty years, with the principal bank in Philadelphia and branch 
banks in the major cities throughout the United States. The bank 

would operate with a capital stock of $
10 million, of which  
four-
ﬁ fths 
would be subscribed by private investors and  one-
ﬁfth by the govern
-ment. Thus it would be a  
qua
si-
public, 
quasi-
private institution. Man
-agement of the bank would consist of a president and a board of 

twe
nty-
ﬁve directors, of whom twenty would be elected by the sub
-scribers and ﬁ
ve woul
d be appointed by the government. This banking 
system would act as an agent for the collection of taxes and serve as a 

depository of federal funds. It was authorized to issue banknotes, re
-deemable in 
spec
ie and acceptable in the payment of taxes, thereby 
increasing the money supply with which to ﬁ
nance the nation’s eco
-nomic growth. It was Hamilton’s hope that the bank would not only 

pr
ovide sound credit and currency for the country but further unify 
and strengthen it. 
However, Madison, the father of the Constitution, pronounced the 
ban
k unconstitutional. The right to grant a bank charter was not one of 
the delegated powers granted by the Constitution, and therefore was 

reserved to the states and people. And, as a matter of fact, the issue had 

been raised in the constitutional convention and rejected. 
Despite this serious complaint Congress passed the bill early in 
1791
, when it was pointed out that the Constitution speciﬁ
cally allowed the 
legislature to pass “all laws necessary and proper” for the execution of 

its delegated powers. How  
else could Congress implement the funding 
and assumption laws without such a bank? argued its supporters. That 

argument proved convincing. The bill went to President Washington 

for his signature, but before approving it he asked the members of his 

cabinet for their opinion. Jefferson responded with what has been called 

a strict construction of the Constitution, insisting that unless a power 

was speciﬁ
cally delegated to the government it was reserved to the 
states and people. Hamilton, on the other hand, argued a “loose- 

construction” of the Constitution, citing the “implied powers” clause as 

the means of enacting legislation that would implement other powers 

speciﬁ
cally granted to the government. Although still troubled, Wash
-ington decided to sign the measure because he felt obliged to support 

the secretary whose department was directly involved. 
58 
a short history of the united states
In his second report on the public credit on December 
13, 1790
, Hamilton had recommended passage of an excise tax on distilled li
-quor to ease the burden created by the assumption of state debts. It 
wa
s enacted on March 
3, 1791
. There  
were thousands of stills around 
the country and farmers, especially those in western Pennsylvania, 

regularly shipped their surplus grain to eastern markets in the liquid 
59 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
form of whiskey. So they refused to pay the tax and attacked the federal 
revenue ofﬁ
cers who tried to collect it. Alarmed that this re
sistance to 
law might become another Shays’ Rebellion, Washington sent some 

13,000 militiamen in 
1794
 to crush the uprising. Most of these troops 
came from New Jersey, Mary
land, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. It was 
dubbed the Whiskey Rebellion but quickly evaporated upon the arrival 

of the troops in western Pennsylvania. A number of individuals  
were tried for treason, but those convicte
d  were pa
rdoned by Washington. 
Still it had the excellent effect of reafﬁ
rming the authority of the cen
-tral government, something that had to be visibly demonstrated sooner 

or later. It proved that this new government had the will and the power 
to enforce its laws. 
The creation of the militia occurred on May 
8, 1792, when C
ongress 
authorized the states to or
ganize and enroll all white males between 
the ages of eigh
teen and  
forty-
ﬁve. The militiamen proved to be in
-valuable during the Whiskey Rebellion. 
The growing disagreement between those who favored the Hamil
-tonian position on the public debt, the bank, the interpretation of the 

Co
nstitution, the powers of Congress, and the relationship between 
the states and the central government, as distinct from those who 

agreed with the 
Jeffersonian-
Madisonian view, initiated the slow evo
-lution of a 
two
-party system in the United States. Hamilton believed in 
a strong national government, one that would protect property and 

support the nation’s commercial and industrial interests. He distrusted 

the people’s ability to govern wisely and favored rule by the moneyed 

elite. Jefferson and Madison, on the other hand, believed in local au
-tonomy as the best way of protecting individual rights. They worried 

about t
he concentration of power in a central government, arguing that 
the people should be left to govern themselves as much as possible. 
These differences brought about the development of the Hamilto
-nian or Federalist party, while the Jeffersonians became known as the 

Dem
ocratic-
Republican party. The split between the two groups wid
-ened over foreign affairs, particularly after France declared war against 

Great B
ritain, Spain, and Holland in early February 
1793
. The French 
had overthrown their monarchy in a revolution that turned bloody 

during the Reign of Terror. In place of the monarchy they established 

a republic. Since France had aided the United States in achieving its 
60 
a short history of the united states 
inde pen
dence and since it had now become a republic, there was con
-siderable sympathy toward France in this country, especially among 
Re
publicans. But New En
gland merchants and shippers found the 
British a better market for American products and therefore wished to 

encourage a deeper friendship with the former mother country in the 

hope of securing valuable trade concessions. 
The United States was still formally allied to France under the 
Tre
aty of 
1778
, signed during the American Revolution; but when war 
broke out between En
gland and France, President Washington issued 
a Proclamation of Neutrality on April 
22, 1793
, in which he declared 
that this country needed to remain at peace with both of them. He also 

urged Americans to avoid any action that would jeopardize that neu
-trality. This policy set a standard that remained in place for genera
-tions. In Eu
ro
pean wars, which did not really concern the United 
States, it was best to steer clear of any involvement. 
But the brilliant, indiscreet, and impetuous French minister to the 
Un
ited States at that time, 
Edmond-
Charles-Édouard Genet, con
-spired to have Americans attack British vessels along the coast. When 

Ge
net’s actions became known, Washington promptly demanded his 
recall. Since the Jacobins had taken control of the French government 

and had begun the Reign of Terror, Genet wisely decided to remain in 

the United States as a private person, knowing that the guillotine 

awaited him in Paris. He became an American citizen and married a 

daughter of Governor George Clinton of New York. It was obvious 

that the President took his advice on foreign affairs from Hamilton, 

resulting in Jefferson’s resignation as secretary of state. He was suc
-ceeded by Edmund Randolph in January 
1794
. The Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution was also proposed in 
early 
1794
. It resulted from protests by states over the decision of the 
Supreme Court in the case 
Chisholm v. Georgia
. The amendment stated 
that the judicial power of the United States shall not “extend to any suit 

in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United 

States” by a citizen of another state or by citizens of a foreign state. It 

was ratiﬁ
ed on January 
8, 1798
. Meanwhile the situation in foreign affairs worsened when the Brit
-ish issued a series of 
Ord
ers-
in- 
Council in June and November 
1793 
by which U.S. vessels  
were seized and American seamen 
were im
-61 In de pen dence and Nation Building 
pressed into ser
vice in the British navy. In addition, Britain retained 
military posts within the territorial limits of the United  States—in vio
-lation of the peace treaty that had ended the  Revolution—and contin
-ued to incite Indian tribes in the Ohio Valley to attack American 

fro
ntiersmen. 
In an effort to avoid war, Washington dispatched John Jay, the chief 
ju
stice of the United States, to Britain as a special envoy to negotiate 
U.S.
 grievances. What resulted was a treaty signed on November 
29, 1794, with terms humiliating to the United States. The treaty favored 
British interests across the board, said nothing about impressment, and 

required the abandonment of American trade in such staples as cotton, 

sugar, and molasses. Public protests registered the nation’s anger, and 

Jay himself was pilloried. Still, Washington accepted the treaty and 

submitted it to the Senate for ratiﬁ
cation because he feared the possi
-bility of war with Great Britain that would surely jeopardize the na-

tion’
s in
de pen
dence. The Senate did ratify the  
document—but just 
barely—by a  
two-
thirds vote. 
The  
House of Representatives attempted to nullify the treaty by re
-fusing to appropriate the money necessary to implement it. The mem
-bers also called upon the President to submit all the documents and 

cor
respondence relating to the treaty. Washington refused, asserting 
his executive privilege, thus setting an important pre cedent. “It does 

not occur that the inspection of the papers asked for,” snapped the 

President, “can be relative to any purpose under the cognizance of 

the 
House of Representatives, except that of an impeachment which 
the resolution has not expressed.” 
The stinging tone and manner of Washington’s response—especially 
th
e reference to an impeachment—jolted the members of the  House 
and they appropriated the funds for the Jay Treaty on April 
30, 1796
, by the  tie-
breaking vote of the Speaker, Frederick Mühlenberg. 
The furor generated throughout the country by the Jay Treaty pro
-vided the ﬁ
nal st
imulus in the formation of a  two-
party system in the 
United States. Each side attacked the other; each held po
liti
cal rallies; 
and each or
ganized its supporters in an effort to control one or more 
branches of the government. The sainted Washington was condemned 

for his role in sanctioning the treaty. According to one report, Jefferson 

supposedly referred to him as the “Samson whose head was shaved by 
62 
a short history of the united states 
that harlot En
gla
nd.” At a dinner party in Virginia a toast was pro
-posed for the “speedy death” of General Washington. So offended was 
the
 President by this brutal condemnation of his action that he refused 
to run for a third term in ofﬁ
ce, and in 
1796
, after a nasty campaign, 
John Adams was elected over Thomas Jefferson to replace him. As 

runner-
up, Jefferson was chosen Vice President. 
The rise of po
liti
cal parties, and the introduction of partisan politics 
into the operation of the government, was a major turning point in 

U.S.
 affairs. It began a new era in American history. 
3An Emerging Identity
Two m ajor ev ents
 occurred in the United States to close out 
the eigh
teenth century. The ﬁ
rst was a conﬂ
ict that broke out 
between this country and France in 
1797, when the French ministers in 
Paris attempted to extort a bribe of $
240
,000 from American diplo
-mats as the price for recognizing them and their mission. Insulted, all 
bu
t one of these American diplomats returned home, and the country 
expressed its outrage with the cry, “Millions for defense, but not one 

cent for tribute.” There followed what has been called a “Quasi-
War” 
between the two nations during which their ships attacked one another 

on the high seas. This naval conﬂ
 ict from 
1798
 to 1800
 might have led 
to an actual declaration of war save for the determination of President 

Adams to maintain the peace. In an effort to prepare for the possibility 

of war Congress authorized the creation of the Department of the 

Navy and the building of a ﬂ
 eet of warships. It also expanded the size 
of the army. The war hysteria diminished the popularity of the Repub
-lican Party, which was seen as 
pro-
French and therefore as infected 
with “radical” or Jacobin notions about governing the country. 
The genuine fears many Americans felt about Jacobin inﬂ
 uence 
on 
Republican policy brought about the second major event. The Federal
-ist majority in Congress decided to pass a series of laws that they felt 

woul
d help combat foreign intrigues and conspiracies in the United 
States. These 
were the Alien and Sedition Acts, passed in June and July 
1798
, which placed restrictions on both citizens and aliens. These laws 
belied everything the nation professed about liberty and  democracy 
64 
a short history of the united states 
and can be explained only by the fact that Americans  
were genu
inely 
frightened about their safety. The ﬁ
rst of these acts, the Naturalization 
Act, changed the period of residence required to become a citizen from 
ﬁve to fourteen years. This law was repealed in 
1802
, and the Natural
-ization Law of 
1795 wa
s reenacted. The Alien and Alien Enemies Acts 
authorized the President to imprison or deport anyone he deemed a 

threat to the peace and safety of the nation; they expired in 
1800
. The 
Sedition Act imposed ﬁ
nes and imprisonment on both citizens and 
foreigners convicted of publishing any “false, scandalous and malicious 

writing” against the government, Congress, or the President. Limited 

to two years, this act expired in 
1801
. Jefferson and Madison responded to these measures by writing a set 
of
 resolutions passed by the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures in 
1798
. These Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, as they were called, con
-demned the Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional and afﬁ
 rme
d the right of the states to judge for themselves “the mode and mea
sure of 
redress” whenever the national government assumed powers not spe
-ciﬁ
cally delegated to it by the Constitution. Moreover, the states  
were “duty bound to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil.” 
Interpose! There  
were som
e who genuinely believed that states had 
the right and obligation to nullify federal law whenever the central 

government acted  
improperly—and that states had the right to secede 
if necessary. 
With the beginning 
of a n
ew century the ten years of residence 
by the national government in Philadelphia mandated by the Resi
-dency Act of 
1790
 came to an end, and on April 
24, 1800
, President 
Adams signed the legislation that directed the relocation of the gov
-ernment to its new site along the Potomac River. On May 
13 Cong
ress 
stipulated that the second session of the Sixth Congress would convene 
on November 
17 in the new Federal City, to be called Washington after 
the much revered ﬁ
 rst President. 
In June President Adams traveled to Washington to inspect what 
had been bu
ilt in the  ten-
mile square that Pierre Charles L’Enfant had 
laid out. He found what one congressman later described as a city in 

“ruins”—at least, that is the way it looked. Very few government build
-65 An Emerging Identity 
ings had been completed. The Capitol and the Executive Mansion 
were still under construction. Only the Trea
sury, a  
two-
story brick 
building next to the Executive Mansion, was ready for occupancy. 
When Congress convened in November 
180
0, the members gath
-ered in an unﬁ
nis
hed Capitol in an unﬁ
nished city and learned that 
their ﬁ
rst important decision involved settling an unﬁ
 nished presiden
-tial election. John Adams had run for reelection on the Federalist ticket, 

al
ong with General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina 
for Vice President. The Republicans in Congress held their ﬁ
 rst caucus 
for nominating their candidates and chose Thomas Jefferson to head 

their ticket, and Aaron Burr of New York as Vice President. They 

would continue holding caucuses to name their leaders for the execu
-tive branch through the election of 
1824
, when, after loud criticism that 
it was undemo
cratic, the system was ﬁ
nally abandoned. As a substitute, 
state legislatures at ﬁ
rst put forward favored sons, but in 
1832
 both par
-ties began holding conventions of delegates from every state to nomi
-nate their ticket, a practice that continues to this day. 
The friends of Alexander Hamilton despised Adams for many of
-fenses, perhaps most importantly his failure to ask Congress for a dec
-laration of war against France. Toward the end of the campaign, 

Ham
ilton himself published a  
ﬁ fty-
four-
page pamphlet excoriating 
Adams for his public conduct and defects of character, citing his re
-puted weakness, vacillation, and ungovernable temper. What is more, 

Ha
milton conspired with several Federalist electors to have them with
-hold their votes for Adams so that the more acceptable Pinckney would 

be elect
ed President. As a result, Adams lost the election. He struck 
back by calling Hamilton “that bastard son of a Scotch merchant.” 

Jefferson defeated Adams by winning  
seventy-
three electoral votes to 
Adams’s  
sixty-
ﬁve. Pinckney took sixty-
three and John Jay one. But 
Burr ended up with the same number of electoral votes as Jefferson: 

seventy-
three. Republicans, in their desire to capture the executive 
branch, failed to withhold at least one vote for Burr, and the tie that 

resulted meant that the election would be determined by the  
lame-
duck 
House of Representatives, not the new Congress in which Republicans 

had won sizable majorities in both chambers. 
On February 
11 Congress met, counted the electoral ballots, de
-clared a tie, and then turned the ﬁ
nal dec
ision over to the  
House to 
66 
a short history of the united states 
decide whether Jefferson or Burr would become President. It took 
thirt
y-
seven ballots for the  
House to ﬁ
nally choose Jefferson on Febru
-ary 
17, after an agreement was worked out by which it was promised 
that the Republicans would not dismantle the Hamiltonian ﬁ
 scal sys
-tem and that ofﬁ
ceholders who  were Federalists would not be arbi
-trarily removed because of their party afﬁ
li
ation. To prevent a recurrence 
of this unfortunate election, Congress proposed the Twelfth Amend
-ment to the Constitution in December 
180
3. This amendment, which 
provided separate balloting for President and Vice President, was rati
-ﬁed on September 
25, 1804
. Just before leaving ofﬁ
ce Ada
ms appointed a large number of judges 
to the various federal courts under a recently passed Judiciary Act. John 

Marshall, then serving as secretary of state, was nominated to preside 

as chief justice of the United States. Right down to the last day of his 

administration Adams kept bombarding the Senate with these “mid
-night” appointments, as the Republicans called them. The Federalists 

had lo
st the executive and legislative branches, but at least they could 
continue to dominate the judiciary branch. But one of the ﬁ
 rst things 
the Republicans did when they came into power was repeal the Judi
-ciary Act. They also attempted to impeach several of the “midnight” 

appoi
ntees. 
Jefferson took ofﬁ
 ce on
 March 
4, 1801
, and in his inaugural address 
he tried to smooth over the differences and antagonism that existed 

between the two po
liti
cal parties. “We are all Republicans; we are all 
Federalists,” he said. “If there be any among us who would wish to dis
-solve the  
Union or change its republican form, let them stand undis
-turbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be 
to
lerated where reason is left free to combat it.” 
It was a revolutionary moment in U.S. history. Without bloodshed 
or t
urmoil, without accusations of fraud and corruption, without any 
attempt at a conspiracy, the government had been turned over by one 

politi
cal party to another. Once the outcome of the presidential elec
-tion had become known, Margaret Bayard Smith, the wife of the 

own 
er of an important newspaper in Washington, said, “The dark and 
threatening cloud that had hung over the politi
cal horizon rolled harm
-lessly away, and the sunshine of prosperity and gladness broke forth.” 
Although the found
ers had c
reated a government in which the 
67 An Emerging Identity 
legislature was the centerpiece and was given speciﬁ
c powers to run the 
country, President Jefferson sought to control Congress by encouraging 
certain members of the  
House and the Senate to serve as the adminis-
tration’s spokesmen. He generally worked through chairmen of power
-ful committees, such as the  
Ho
use Ways and Means Committee. Like 
other Presidents before and since he regularly proposed a legislative 

agenda in his annual messages to Congress, but he also operated clan
-destinely by giving several dinner parties a week at which his proposals 

coul
d be explained and support for their passage elicited. John Ran
-dolph of Roanoke, who had been one of Jefferson’s original spokesmen 

bu
t later broke away, denounced the President’s practice. He revealed 
and lambasted “the 
back-
stairs inﬂ
uence of men who bring messages to 
this 
House [of Representatives], which, although they do not appear 
on the Journals, govern its decisions.” When he heard about this out
-burst, Jefferson countered by declaring, “We never heard this while the 

decl
aimer was himself a backstairs man as he called it.” But the Presi
-dent was very effective in imposing his will on the Congress. As Josiah 

Qu
incy, a Federalist from Massachusetts, noted, “all the great political 
questions are settled somewhere  
else,” not in the halls of Congress. 
Here, then, is one of the more important po
liti
cal threads of Ameri
-can history: the ongoing struggle between the executive and legislative 

br
anches of government to control national policy. Over the past two 
centuries Presidents have frequently sent military forces into battle 

without a declaration of war by Congress. And at various times, Presi
-dents have assumed the power of the purse to deal with such problems 

as eco
nomic panics and depressions. Over the years the pendulum of 
control of national policy would swing back and forth. During much of 

the nineteenth century control remained with Congress, except during 

the presidencies of Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, who both 

steered the  
House and Senate in the direction they wished to see the 
country take. But starting in the twentieth century, as will be seen, the 

leadership was reversed and many more Presidents assumed greater 

control of legislative action. 
An early example of a President assuming wartime powers occurred 
when Jefferson decided to end the practice of bribing the Barbary na
-tions of Algiers, Morocco, Tunis, and Tripoli to keep them from seiz
-
ing American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and holding 
68 
a short history of the united states 
American seamen for ransom. The President refused to continue 
payi
ng the tribute, and the pasha of Tripoli reacted with a declaration 
of war, by ordering his soldiers to chop down the ﬂ
agpole at the Amer
-ican consulate. Congress was not in session when this incident was re
-ported; consequently, Jefferson on his own authority dispatched a 

squad
ron of warships to the area, but he did so without summoning the 
legislature into special session. And when Congress did return at its 

regular time there was no request for a declaration of war and no effort 

by the legislature to take action. Instead Congress raised import taxes 

in order to pay for the war. After several years of intermittent ﬁ
 ghting, 
the pasha sued for peace and was paid a ransom of $
60,000 for the re
-lease of American prisoners. But payments to the other Barbary states 

con
tinued until 
1816
. This  
high-
handed involvement in a war by the President who did 
not have congressional authorization encouraged Jefferson to expand 

his powers again after he decided to purchase Louisiana from France. 
When he learned that the Spanish had closed New Orleans to 
Am
erican trade and that Napoleon, in his desire to revive the French 
empire in North America, had pressured the Spanish into ceding Lou
-isiana back to France in the Treaty of San Ildefonso in October 
180
0, the President recognized it as a threat to the safety of the United States. 

“There is on the globe one single spot the possessor of which is our 

natural and habitual enemy,” he said. “It is New Orleans.” From the 

moment that France takes possession of New Orleans, he continued, 

“we must marry ourselves to the British ﬂ
eet and nation.” 
Jefferson immediately notiﬁ
ed the U.S. minister to France, Robert 
R. 
Livingston, to begin negotiations for the purchase of New Orleans, 
an
d he dispatched James Monroe as an envoy extraordinary with au
-thority to offer $
2 million for New Orleans and West Florida. In the 
meantime Napoleon had abandoned his plan for a revival of the French 

colonial empire in the New World when his troops, attempting to put 

down a slave revolt,  
were soundly defeated in Haiti by native forces 
under  
Toussaint-
Louverture. In need of money to further his military 
ambitions against Great Britain, he decided to sell the entire province 

of Louisiana. On April 
11, 1803
, the French foreign minister, Talley
-rand, asked Livingston how much the United States would be willing 

to pay f
or this vast stretch of territory. At length they ﬁ
nally agreed on 
69 An Emerging Identity 
60 million francs, or approximately $
15 million, and the treaty was 
signed on April 
30. Of this amount, the French received $
11.25 million 
in six percent stock, not redeemable for ﬁ
fteen years. The United States 
assumed a total of $
3.75 million to pay claims of its citizens against 
France. 
It was an incredible bargain, and it doubled the size of the nation. 
Bu
t its constitutionality was immediately challenged by the Federal
-ists, who argued that there was nothing in the Constitution to permit 
th
is annexation. Moreover, Congress did not have the power to incor
-porate this vast area and its people into the  
Un
ion without the approval 
of the several states. The President had acted unlawfully, they insisted. 

Even Jefferson had doubts about the legality of his action, not that 

these doubts stopped him. “The Constitution,” he explained to Senator 

John Breckinridge, “has made no provision for our holding foreign ter
-ritory, still less for incorporating foreign nations into our  
Un
ion.” But 
he set aside these doubts in the belief that this acquisition was essential 

for the future safety of the country. 
The Senate quickly ratiﬁed the treaty on October 
20 by a vote o
f twenty-
four to seven, with all but one Federalist voting against it. The 
House agreed and, after a long and stormy debate, authorized the cer
-tiﬁcates of stock to be paid to the French and directed the President to 
take control of Louisiana. The U.S. ﬂ
ag was raised above New Orleans 
on December 
30, 1803
. Shortly after asking Congress for money to undertake the negotia
-tions regarding Louisiana, Jefferson also requested a small appropria
-tion of $
2,500
 for an expedition to explore the Missouri River to its 
source. By the time Meriwether Lewis and William Clark began their 

celebrated journey westward, Louisiana had been acquired, and the 

two men now undertook the exploration of a greatly expanded nation. 

They pushed west to the mouth of the Columbia River, giving the 

United States a claim to the Oregon country. The Lewis and Clark 

expedition, from 
1803
 to 1806
, not only brought back signiﬁ
 cant scien
-tiﬁc information but stimulated western settlement of this new expanse 
of territory. 
In another action to broaden executive authority, Jefferson demanded 
a ch
ange in the judicial system. The Judiciary Act of 
1802
 restored a 
six-
member Supreme Court and established six new circuit courts. 
70 
a short history of the united states 
Jefferson also sought the removal of a number of justices who regularly 
in
jected politics into their decisions. Perhaps the most famous episode 
in this regard was the impeachment of an Associate Justice of the Su
-preme Court, Samuel Chase, which failed to result in his removal. 
Jefferson was particularly offended when Chief Justice John Mar
-shall read his decision in the case of 
Mar
bury v. Madison
. Marbury was 
one of the midnight appointments but had not received his commission 

to serve as justice of the peace. He therefore sued James Madison, the 

secretary of state, and demanded that his commission be handed over. 

In the decision of February 
24, 1803
, Marshall dismissed Marbury’s 
suit on the ground that he did not have the authority to act. He lacked 

jurisdiction because Section 
13 of the Judiciary Act of 
1789
, which con
-ferred such authority, was unconstitutional. This was the ﬁ
rst t
ime a 
congressional statute was voided by the high court. The decision pro
-
nounced the doctrine of judicial review, and although the doctrine was 

no
t used again for ﬁ
fty years, it had the effect of raising the judiciary to 
equality with the other two branches of government. 
The first administration 
of T
homas Jefferson was an un
-qualiﬁ
ed success in what it achieved, but the second, following his re
-election in 
180
4, brought one failure after another. The basic problem 
was the continued harassment by the British against U.S. ships at sea 
and the  
impressment of American seamen. With the renewal of war 
between En
gland and France, the British issued a series of orders-
in-
council that decreed a blockade of the Eu
ropean coast from Brest to 
the Elbe River and barred all ships from the French coastal trade. 

Napoleon countered by issuing the Berlin and Milan decrees, by which 

Britain was blockaded and neutral ships  
were threatened with seizure if 
they obeyed the 
orders-
in-
council. Caught between these two rivals, 
Jefferson asked Congress for an embargo that would forbid American 

ships to leave port for a foreign destination, and forbid foreign ships to 

leave American ports with U.S. goods. The Embargo Act of 
1807 
proved to be a disaster for the United States. It mainly affected Ameri
-can trade. Large coastal cities suffered tremendous losses, and New 

England verged on rebellion. 
71 An Emerging Identity 
The obvious failure of the Embargo Act prompted its repeal. It was 
replaced by the  
Non-
Importation Act of March 
1, 1809
, which reopened 
trade with all foreign nations except France and En
gland. And it en
-couraged Jefferson to imitate George Washington and step down after 
tw
o terms in ofﬁ
ce. He was succeeded by James Madison, who also 
failed to compel the two belligerents to respect neutral rights. Congress 

tried to help by passing Macon’s Bill No. 
2, which removed all trade 
restrictions against France and En
gland but decreed that if either of the 
belligerents revoked its decrees, the President was empowered to reim
-pose nonintercourse on the other belligerent. Naturally Napoleon took 

adva
ntage of this invitation to deception by announcing, falsely, that he 
would revoke the Berlin and Milan decrees. And Madison believed 

him. The President announced the continuance of trade with France 

and its closing with Great Britain. It was not long before Madison real
-ized he had been hoodwinked and made to play the fool. Britain re
-sponded by redoubling its impressment of American seamen. 
As presidential leadership faltered, a newly elected member of the 
Ho
use of Representatives, Henry Clay, stepped forward and launched 
his congressional career with such brilliance that other members 

quickly succumbed to his direction. Elected Speaker on his ﬁ
rst day in 
ofﬁ
ce—his earlier but brief career in the U.S. Senate provided proof of 
his outstanding  
abilities—he had every intention of determining na
-tional policy and the legislation to come to the ﬂ
oor o
f the  
House for a 
vote. Unlike his pre 
deces sors, who acted more like trafﬁ
c cops in di
-recting the ﬂ
ow of debate, in imitation of British speakers, Clay be
-came an integral part of 
Ho
use operations and participated directly in 
the debates on important issues and in inﬂ
uencing their outcome. 
He appointed chairmen of committees who would assist his efforts to 

make the  
House a dominant force in national politics. He enforced the 
rules of the  
House and never hesitated to cut off debate when he felt 
that it was time for a vote. To prevent ﬁ
libusters, he allowed members 
to call the previous question. On occasion he muzzled John Randolph 

and forbade him to enter the  
House chamber with one of his hunting 
hounds. Part of his success as Speaker and the reason he was reelected 

whenever he ran for the ofﬁ
ce was his eminently fair and evenhanded 
treatment of his colleagues. Added to this  
were his quick wit, his 
72 
a short history of the united states 
ferocious intellect, his sharp tongue, and his mesmerizing talents as an 
or
ator and debater. He proved to be the ﬁ
rst great Speaker of the 
House of Representatives. 
Under his direction and with the help of 
lik
e-
minded members, 
known as War Hawks, who felt the British needed to be shown conclu
-sively that the United States would no longer suffer the humiliations 

im
posed by their policy toward neutral nations, Clay moved the  
House 
in the direction of seeking immediate redress. Working with the ad
-ministration as much as possible, he helped persuade the President to 

as
k Congress for a declaration of war. Most likely Madison had already 
made that decision, and a request for such a declaration came from 

Madison on June 
1, 1812
. After a  
three-
day debate, steered by the 
Speaker, it was quickly passed in the  
House by a vote of 
seventy-
nine to 
forty-
nine. The Senate took more time but ﬁnally gave its consent on 
June 
17. The President signed the declaration the next day and pro
-claimed that a state of war existed between the United States and Great 

Br
itain. Two days later Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary, 
agreed to suspend the  orders-
in-
council. 
At ﬁ rst the war appeared to be a colossal mistake, if not a catastro
-phe. A  
three-
pronged invasion of Canada by American soldiers ended 
in defeat on all fronts. The invasion also terminated any thought Cana
-dians might have had about alienating themselves from British rule. 

Fur
thermore, General William Hull surrendered Detroit to British 
invaders out of fear that any re
sistance could bring a massacre of women 
and children in the city by Indians allied to the British. Meanwhile 

England blockaded the east and gulf coasts from New York to the 
mouth of the Mississippi River. Initially New England was exempt 

from the blockade in the hope that it would secede from the United 

States. 
To make matters worse, Napoleon abdicated after a failed invasion 
of Rus
sia, leaving England free to direct its full military force against 
its former colonies in America. In addition, the Creek Indians in the 

southeast began a general uprising along the Alabama frontier and 

massacred hundreds of Americans at Fort Mims, about  
thirty-
ﬁ ve miles north of Mobile. The governor of Tennessee dispatched General 

Andrew Jackson of the west Tennessee militia to subdue the Creeks. 

Affectionately dubbed “Old Hickory” by his soldiers, in admiration of 
73 An Emerging Identity 
his leadership, Jackson defeated the Creeks after a series of engage
-ments at the Battle of 
Hors
eshoe Bend on March 
27, 1814
. As part of 
the peace treaty, he exacted about  
two-
thirds of Creek land in Alabama 
and Georgia, which was ceded to the United States. 
To crush the Americans and bring the war to a speedy conclusion, 
th
e British concocted a major offensive from three areas: Lake Cham
-plain, the Chesapeake Bay region, and New Orleans. General Sir George 
Prevost h
eaded the invasion from Canada. Commanding an army of 
over 
10,000, he marched from the St. Lawrence River area to the west
-ern edge of Lake Champlain, where an American naval force blocked 

hi
s further penetration into the United States and ultimately forced his 
withdrawal to Canada. 
Veterans of the Napoleonic war  
were tr
ansported to America and on 
August 
24, 1814
, an army of 
4,000 under the command of General 
Robert Ross landed in Mary
land, marched to Washington, and burned 

the capital. The executive mansion, the Capitol, and most of the public 

buildings  
were put to the torch. Fortunately, a violent storm, which 
might have been a hurricane, struck during the night, extinguishing 

the ﬁ
res and preventing what could have been the total destruction of 
the city. 
The British had intended to take Baltimore but  were repulsed by a 
st
rong American army that fortiﬁ
ed the heights around the city. When 
the British ﬂ
eet and army withdrew from the Chesapeake area, they 

were ordered to seize New Orleans and gain control of the lower Mis
-sissippi River valley. By the time they arrived off the coast of Louisi
-ana, General Jackson was waiting for them. He had hurriedly marched 

to t
he threatened city after defeating the Creeks and had taken a posi
-tion behind a millrace or ditch that stretched from the Mississippi 

Ri
ver to a swamp about a mile away. The British tried to smash their 
way through this line of defense but failed. Over 
2,000 British soldiers 
were killed, wounded, or missing in the action that took place on Janu
-ary 
8, 1815
, about ten miles south of New Orleans, while the Americans 
suffered only a dozen or so casualties. 
The victory represented the ﬁ
rst t
ime the United States had dem
-onstrated its will and capacity to defend its in
de pen
dence in a world 
hostile to its existence. Ordinary citizens had faced and defeated a 

powerful enemy. The Battle of New Orleans made Americans proud 
74 
a short history of the united states 
of their country and themselves. “The last six months is the proudest 
pe
riod in the history of the republic,” claimed 
Niles Weekly Register
, the Baltimore newspaper. “
Who would not be an American? Long live the 
Republic
.” American commissioners at 
Gh
ent—in what is now  Belgium— 
produced a peace treaty with Great Britain on Christmas Eve 
1814
, weeks before the New Orleans battle took place. But the treaty would 

not go into effect until both sides approved it. The Senate received it on 

February 
15, 1815
, and ratiﬁ
ed it the following day. And that is when the 
war ofﬁ
cially came to a close. 
The news of the victory and the writing of a peace treaty reached 
Wa
shington at the same time that a delegation from a convention of 
New En
gland states held in Hartford, Connecticut, arrived to demand 
constitutional changes in the operation of the government. The states 

represented at the convention had adopted resolutions as the price of 

their continued allegiance to the  Union. But with the country wildly 

delirious over its military victory at New Orleans and the signing of a 

peace treaty in Ghent, the delegates realized that their demands would 

receive short shrift. So they quietly turned around and went home. The 

Hartford Convention was never controlled by secessionists, but suspi
-cions of treason on the part of its participants lingered for many years. 

The suspicions  
were directed mainly at the Federalist Party, which was 
accused of initiating and participating in this disloyalty. As a conse
-quence, the party lost pop 
ul
ar support and steadily declined as a na
-tional or
ganizati
on. It staggered on for a few more years in a few New 
England states but ﬁ
nally disappeared. Its disappearance marked a 
suspension of po
liti
cal strife between two opposing parties. There was 
now only one national 
party—the Republican  
Party—and the next 
several years were known as “the Era of Good Feelings.” 
Following the war 
the country underwent a series of important 
ch
anges that transformed not only the American people but their cul
-ture, their society, and their relations with foreign nations. National
-ism, the sense that a new breed of citizen had emerged, was perhaps the 

mo
st obvious change. People  
were proud to call themselves Americans. 
No longer did they refer to themselves as New Yorkers, Virginians, or 
75 An Emerging Identity 
Pennsylvanians, as in the past. They had a new and distinct identity. 
They 
were united in their victory over their enemy, and they were 
united in a republican form of government that was unique in the west
-ern world. Americans after the war were markedly different from their 

predeces sor
s. No longer colonists, no longer British, no longer Eu
ro-pean, they reveled in the discovery of their special characteristics. Over 

ti
me they gave up wearing wigs, silk stockings, rufﬂ
ed shirts, and knee 
breeches; instead they donned trousers and shirts with neckties and 

jackets. When they spoke, their accent no longer sounded British but 

had a distinctly American twang. What is regarded today as the Amer
-ican character slowly emerged after the War of 
1812
. The sense of nationhood was spurred on by a series of Supreme 
Co
urt decisions that favored the central government at the expense of 
individual states. In 
Fletcher v. Peck
 (1810
), Chief Justice Marshall and 
the Court struck down one of Georgia’s laws; in 
Martin v. Hunter’s 
Lessee
 (1816
) they contradicted the highest court in Virginia, which had 
claimed the case could not be appealed to the Supreme Court; and in 

the Dartmouth College case an action by the New Hampshire legisla
-ture in changing the charter of the college was reversed as a violation of 

th
e U.S. Constitution, which forbade impairing the obligation of 
contracts. The college’s charter, declared Marshall, was a contract and 

therefore could not be altered. Then, in 
McCulloch v. Maryland
, the 
Supreme Court declared that a tax levied by Maryland on the Balti
-more branch of the Bank of the United States, which had been char
-tered by the federal government, was void. “The power to tax involves 

th
e power to destroy,” Marshall ruled, and no state may tax or control 
any institution created by the national government within its borders. 

Finally, in 
Gibbons v. Ogden
 the court annulled the monopoly on steam
-boat trafﬁ
c th
at the New York legislature had granted to Robert Liv
-ingston and Robert Fulton, declaring that only Congress can control 

in
terstate and foreign commerce. 
Another expression of nationalism in the period following the War 
of 1812
 was the beginning of a genuine and uniquely American form of 
literature. Between 
1815
 and 
1830
 a number of writers offered works 
based upon native themes and set in recognizable local places. Wash
-ington Irving was one such artist, whose 
His
tory of New York . . .  by 
Diedrich Knickerbocker
 (1809
) and 
Sketch Book
 (1819
) led the way in 
76 
a short history of the united states 
providing stories about people and locales that Americans could recog
-nize and enjoy. James Fenimore Cooper went farther. His works 
The Spy
 (1821), The Pioneers
 (1823
), the ﬁ
rst of the Leatherstocking series, 
and 
The Last of the Mohicans
 (1826
) extolled American history and the 
life of the frontier. This early beginning of a distinctly American art 
form was later enlarged upon, and its artistry greatly surpassed, by 

more distinguished writers. 
In addition to 
this
 nationalistic outburst, the industrial revolu
-tion arrived within the country and began the pro 
ces
s by which an 
inde pen
dent national domestic economy would be achieved to spare 
the nation the problem of relying on foreign imports for the necessities 
of life. In New En
gland and the Middle Atlantic states ﬁ
 nancial capi
-tal shifted from commerce to manufacturing, and something like 
140 
cotton mills began operating. Within a few years 
500
,000 spindles 
were said to be functioning throughout New England. Factories turned 

out iron, woolen, and cotton products, and these industries spread to 

the Ohio Valley and the Middle West. The market revolution that 

ensued converted the country in time from a purely agricultural to an 

industrial society. A transportation revolution witnessed the building 

of roads, bridges, and canals, the most famous of which was the Erie 

Canal in New York: it opened in 
1825
 and connected the Hudson River 
with Lake Erie, stimulating the growth of such cities as Buffalo, Cleve
-land, Detroit, and Chicago. New York City thus became the leading 

commercial center in the United States. The transportation revolution 
also provided the country with railroads, starting in the 
1820
s. In the 
next forty years railroad tracks would stretch 
3,000 miles across the 
continent. 
The manufacturing interests of the northern states demanded 
hi
gher tariffs to protect themselves against  
foreign—mainly 
British— 
competition, and they therefore supported the idea of free immigration 

to provide the laborers they needed for their mills and factories. They 

also naturally opposed westward migration, which could empty their 

establishments of workers; but they favored easy credit and a sound 

currency and banking system. 
The South, on the other hand, turned increasingly toward the culti
-77 An Emerging Identity 
vation of cotton. With the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney 
in 1793
, it became possible to grow 
short-
ﬁber cotton, whose seeds 
could be extracted by the cotton gin more than 
300
 times faster than 
removing them by hand. As a result, the plantation system moved 

steadily westward along the gulf coast and necessitated an 
ever-
larger 
workforce. Slave labor was essential to the plantation system, and the 

laws regarding slavery in the South became more restrictive. By 
1820 
over  
one-
third of the cotton grown in the United States was raised west 
of the Appalachian Mountains. 
The original thirteen states of the early Republic had grown to 
nineteen by the end of the war, and a new era of expansion took shape. 
The Louisiana Purchase allowed thousands to seek a better life in the 

West. By 
1818
 about 
60,000 settlers had crossed the Mississippi River 
and penetrated deep into the interior along the Missouri River. St. 

Louis became a bustling city cashing in on the fur trade that had 

opened up. Steamboats plied the Mississippi River from the upper 

Midwest to New Orleans. It had taken British colonists 
150
 years to 
occupy an inland area of about 
100
 miles from the coastline. In less 
than ﬁ
fty years, following this “Second War for Inde 
pen
dence,” Amer
-icans, bursting with determination, optimism, and 
self-conﬁ
 dence, 
would stretch the boundaries of their country south to the Gulf of 

Mexico and the Rio Grande, north to the 
49th parallel, and west to the 
Paciﬁ
c Ocean. It was the true beginning of a new nation that by the 
end of the nineteenth century would rise to become a world power. 
Americans of the early nineteenth century 
we
re intent on building a 
materialistic society, one dedicated to business, trade, and the acquisi
-tion of wealth. To them, money meant everything. “No man in Amer
-ica is contented to be poor, or expects to continue so,” observed one 

fo
reign traveler. “Go ahead. Go ahead”—that was the spirit of the age. 
“The 
whole continent presents a scene of 
scrambling
 and roars with 
greedy hurry,” commented another visitor. “Go ahead is the order of 

the day, the real motto of the country.” Senator Daniel Webster of 

Massachusetts agreed. “Our age,” he said, “is full of excitement” and 

rapid change. 
Americans  
were com
mitted to the work ethic. It had been prevalent 
in the country since the arrival of the ﬁ
 rst En
glish settlers, and by the 
nineteenth century it had taken on a special urgency and new purpose. 
78 
a short history of the united states 
“Work,” lectured one man, “and at eigh
teen 
you shall . . .  
live in plenty, 
be well clothed, well  housed, and able to save.” Other rewards would 
follow. “Be attentive to your work, be sober and religious, and you will 

ﬁnd a devoted and submissive wife; you will have a more comfortable 
home than many of the higher classes in Eu
rope.” Not only will you be 
better off and more comfortable, he continued, but you will be admired 

by everyone in your community. “He who is an active and useful mem
-ber of society, who contributes his share to augment the national wealth 

an
d increase the numbers of the population, he only is looked upon 
with respect and favor.” 
With such motivation, it is little wonder that these Americans de
-veloped a strong and successful economy. Fired by ambition and pur
-pose, committed to the work ethic, and appreciative of the seemingly 

li
mitless wealth they discovered in the natural resources surrounding 
them, they reached, within a relatively short time, the “take off” stage 

in becoming a powerful industrial society. 
Government changed as 
well
, and Madison initiated the new 
direction by calling for a different approach in the way Washington 
operated. In his annual message he urged the Congress to take the lead 

in safeguarding the economic interests of the nation. He recommended 

the creation of another national bank to provide sound credit and cur
-rency, the imposition of a protective tariff to encourage the establish
-ment and growth of native manufactures, and the ﬁ
nan
cing of internal 
improvements to promote westward expansion. These  
were Federalist 
doctrines, now advanced and supported by ardent nationalists who 

demanded a more modern concept of the responsibilities of govern
-ment in protecting the welfare and liberties of the American people 

and
 in accelerating the emerging market revolution. “En
gland is the 
most formidable power in the world,” exclaimed Representative John 

C. Calhoun of South Carolina. “We, on the contrary, are the most 

gr
owing nation on earth.” 
Henry Clay, now returned as Speaker of the  
Ho
use of Representa
-tives following his sojourn in Eu
ro
pe as a commissioner who helped 
draft the peace treaty at Ghent, viewed these economic proposals as 

essential for the continued life, growth, and prosperity of this country 
79 An Emerging Identity 
and set about enacting them into law. Using the enormous powers 
he had earlier built into the ofﬁ
ce of Speaker, he won support in the 
House for a series of mea
sures that he later articulated in what he 
called his American 
System—that is, a system to approve tariffs, inter
-nal improvements, and viable currency and credit. Before President 

Madiso
n’s term in ofﬁ
ce ended, a number of these proposals had be
-come law. In 
181
6 the Second National Bank of the United States was 
created that was similar to the First Bank, but its capital stock was 

larger and it was obliged to pay the government a bonus of $
1.5 million. 
Calhoun, as chairman of the 
House Committee on the National Cur
-rency, wanted to use the bonus, along with dividends from the govern-

me
nt’s bank stock, to construct roads and canals that would stimulate 
commercial development. “Let us then bind the Republic together 

with a perfect system of roads and canals,” he cried in presenting his 

bill. “Let us conquer space.” But Madison had doubts about the consti
-tutionality of the bill after it passed Congress and vetoed it just days 

be
fore he left ofﬁ
 ce. On April 
27, 181
6, Congress also enacted the ﬁ
rst protective tariff in 
U.S.
 history. It established a  
twe
nty-
ﬁ ve-percent duty on woolen and 
cotton goods and a  
thirty-
percent duty on iron products. The 
whole 
idea was to encourage manufacturing in this country and block compe
-
tition from foreign nations, which could easily undercut the price of 

nat
ive products by companies just getting started. Furthermore Con
-gress increased the size of the navy, and created an army of 
10,000 me
n. It was a wholly new approach to governmental operations in that 
the central government, not the states, was expected to provide the 

kind of leadership that would advance the interests of the entire nation. 

It justiﬁ
ed Calhoun’s claim that the United States, as a single unity, 
was “the most growing nation on earth.” 
Madison was replaced as President by James Monroe, the last of 
the 
so-called Virginia Dynasty, which included Jefferson, Madison, 
and Monroe and endured for a total of twenty-
four years. Monroe, 
along with his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, tended to pursue 

foreign rather than domestic affairs, and together they acquired Span
-ish Florida by treaty and formulated the Monroe Doctrine, addressing 

fo
reign intrusion in the western hemi
sphere. 
The acquisition of Florida came about because the Seminole Indians 
80 
a short history of the united states 
in Florida regularly crossed the border into the United States, borders 
th
at white men had created that meant nothing to these Native Amer
-icans in their pursuit of enemies, food, and adventure. The Seminoles 

regu
larly attacked American settlements in Georgia and Alabama and 
then retreated back into Florida, where they knew the Americans 

would not pursue them. Monroe decided to put an end to this practice 

and instructed his newly appointed secretary of war, Calhoun, to direct 

General Andrew Jackson, now the commander of the U.S. southern 

army, to halt these Indian invasions and if necessary to cross the border 

and attack them in their towns in Spanish territory. Jackson, a very ag
-gressive general, decided on a more productive course of action and 

as
ked permission to seize Florida from the Spanish. That would be the 
surest way of dealing with the Indian problem and bringing the incur
-sions along the American frontier to a complete halt. As far as can be 

de
termined, Jackson received permission from Monroe himself, or 
thought he did, although the President’s letter was rather guarded, as 

might be expected. So Jackson slammed across the Florida border, 

killed a number of Seminoles, and burned their towns. He also cap
-tured two British nationals, Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert Ambris
-ter, accused of aiding the Indians, and had them executed: one hanged, 

th
e other shot by a ﬁ
ring squad. Finally, Jackson captured St. Marks 
and Pensacola, the two important seats of Spanish authority in Florida, 

and turned them over to the United States. 
Henry Clay was

ed—or so he said. He harbored a grudge 
against Monroe for selecting Adams instead of himself as secretary of 

state, and he used the invasion as an excuse to lambaste the administra
-tion. After all, Jackson had invaded Florida, had engaged in hostilities 

wi
th the Indians and Spanish, and had executed foreign nationals 
without a declaration of war by Congress. Clay wanted the general 

punished and his actions repudiated, so he gave a powerful speech in 

the  
House of Representatives demanding that Jackson be censured. He 
failed in this attempt, but he did succeed in making a lifelong enemy of 

Old Hickory. 
Adams defended Jackson’s action both within the administration 
an
d with Spanish and British ofﬁ
cials. After all, he said, Americans 
had suffered long enough because of the inability of Spain to control 

the movement of the Seminoles into the United States. It would be best 
Adam’s Onís Treaty with Spain
82 
a short history of the united states 
for Spain to sell us this troublesome territory, he argued. The result 
wa
s the  
Adams- 
Onís Treaty of February 
22, 1819
, by which Spain 
ceded Florida to the United States and, in return, the United States 

agreed to assume the claims of American citizens against Spain to the 

extent of $
5 million. In addition, the western boundary of the Louisi
-ana Purchase was determined and the United States inherited the 

cl
aims of Spain to the northwest country beyond the Louisiana terri
-tory. 
Quite obviously the nation was growing in more ways than Calhoun 
ima
gined. New states had been admitted to the  Union during the past 
decade: Louisiana in 
1810
, Indiana in 
1816
, Mississippi in 
1817
, and Il
-linois in 
1818
. Then, in 
1819
, Congress took up the requests for state
-hood from Alabama and Missouri. There was no problem in granting 

Al
abama’s admission, but Missouri’s unleashed a storm of objections 
that almost resulted in the breakup of the  Union. 
The Missouri Territory had been carved out of the Louisiana Pur
-chase, and it sought admission as a slave state. If granted it would be 

the
 ﬁrst state totally located west of the Mississippi River. But it 
would also upset the numerical balance between free and slave states. 

This was obviously a situation that called for compromise, but neither 

the slave nor free states seemed prepared to reconcile their demands 

with each other’s needs. The matter came to a head when Represen
-tative James Tallmadge of New York introduced an amendment to the 

Mi
ssouri enabling act which prohibited the further introduction of 
slaves into the territory and mandated the emancipation of all slaves 

subsequently born in Missouri when they reached the age of 
twenty
-ﬁ ve. Southerners  
were in
furiated by this bold attempt to allow Congress 
to outlaw slavery in the territories. They insisted they had a right under 

the Constitution to take their slaves anywhere in the territories and 
were determined to protect that right under all circumstances. After all, the 

Constitution protected property; and slaves, according to southerners, 

were property. The debate in Congress grew more and more heated 

with each passing day. “If you persist,” Representative Thomas W. 

Cobb of Georgia shouted at Tallmadge, “the 
Union will be dissolved. 
You have kindled a ﬁre which all the waters of the ocean cannot put 

out, which seas of blood can only extinguish.” 
83 An Emerging Identity 
“Let it come,” roared Tallmadge in response. 
Despite the anger and threats of secession, the amendment passed 
th
e  House by a vote of 
79 to 67. But the Senate, where southerners had 
greater numerical strength and friendlier sympathizers, defeated the 

mea
sure 
31 to 7. With mounting tension and verbal explosions a daily 
occurrence in the lower chamber, Speaker Clay feared the worst. “The 

words, civil war and disunion,” he told a friend, “are uttered almost 

without emotion.” 
A possible escape from this predicament occurred when Maine, the 
no
rthern province of Massachusetts, petitioned Congress for admis
-sion to the 
Un
ion as a separate and free state. Thus the admission of 
both Missouri and Maine would at least maintain the numerical bal
-ance between free and slave states. As part of the compromise Senator 

Je
sse Thomas of Illinois offered an amendment to the Missouri en
-abling act which prohibited the extension of slavery into the Louisiana 

Te
rritory north of 
36° 30' with the exception of Missouri itself. 
And that did the trick. Although the  
Ho
use of Representatives re
-jected a single bill containing all these provisions, it miraculously 

passed t
hree separate mea
sures that did the same thing, namely admit 
both states and restrict slavery north of 
36° 30'
 in the Louisiana Terri
-tory. Southerners did not take exception to the latter provision, recog
-nizing that slavery could not exist in such a northern clime. Presumably 

th
ey could take their slaves into the western and southern territories. 
“The Southern & Western people talked so much, threatened so loudly, 

& predicted such dreadful consequences,” declared Representative 

William Plumer of New Hampshire, “. . . that they fairly frightened 

our  
weak-
minded members into an abandonment of their stand against 
slavery in the territories.” 
Before opposition could be or
ga
nized against these mea
sures, 
Speaker Clay signed them and hurried them to the Senate, where they 

received quick passage. John Randolph called for a reconsideration of 

the bills, but Clay ruled him out of order and the  
House sustained his 
ruling. It was a close call. 
Without question, the Missouri Compromise of 
1820
 became law 
because of the parliamentary skills of Henry Clay. From that moment 

on he was known as the “Great Compromiser” or “Great Paciﬁ
 cator.” 
“The Constitution of the 
Union was in danger,” wrote Langdon  Cheves 
84 
a short history of the united states 
of South Carolina, “& has been Saved,” thanks to Henry Clay. With
-out bloodshed or dismemberment of the country, Missouri entered the 
Un
ion. But an obvious problem remained. Secession may have been 
avoided; still, the central question of whether Congress had the right 

to prohibit slavery in the territories had not been resolved to the satis
-faction of either the North or the South. It would plague the country 

fo
r the next forty years. But as Abraham Lincoln noted years later, 
Henry Clay made the difference. As long as Clay remained alive, Lin
-coln said, he could always ﬁ
nd t
he compromise to keep the country 
from rushing into civil war and the dissolution of the  
Union. 
President Monroe signed the several bills that admitted Maine and 
Mis
souri as the 
twenty-
third and  
twenty-
fourth states comprising the 
United States, but he had little to do with bringing about this historic 

settlement. He left domestic affairs pretty much to Congress, where 

Clay played the most dominant role. This freed the President to con
-centrate on foreign affairs, in which he scored several successes. He 

recogn
ized the in
de pen
dence of those Latin American nations that 
had escaped Spanish rule and gained the approval of Congress. The 

Republic of Colombia was recognized on June 
19, 1822
; Mexico on De
-cember 
12, 1822
; Chile and Argentina on January 
27, 1823
; Brazil on 
May 
26, 1824
; the Federation of Central American States on August 
4, 1824
; and Peru on May 
2, 1826
. He approved the treaty signed with 
Rus sia that ﬁ
xed the southern boundary of Alaska, a Rus
sian posses
-sion, at 
54° 40'; h
e agreed to the acquisition of Florida and the settle
-ment of the western boundary of the Louisiana Purchase; and in his 

an
nual message to Congress on December 
2, 1823
, he announced what 
has been called the Monroe Doctrine. In justice it must be pointed out 

that his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, served as the principal 

negotiator in all these successes. 
When the members of the Qua 
dru
ple or Holy Alliance (France, 
Austria, Prus
sia, and Rus
sia) agreed in 
1822
 at the Congress of Verona 
to restore King Ferdinand VII of Spain to full authority after he had 

surrendered and accepted the demands of those who insisted on a con
-stitutional monarchy, Great Britain became concerned about such a 

po
licy and especially fearful that the Holy Alliance might attempt to 
restore Spanish control of its lost possessions in South America. En
-gland enjoyed economic advantages in dealing with inde 
pen
dent South 
85 An Emerging Identity 
American states and did not want to see a return to the previous 
arrangement, which favored Spanish interests. George Canning, the 

British foreign secretary, suggested to Richard Rush, the U.S. minister 

to En
gland, that their two countries jointly agree to oppose any inter
-vention by Eu
ro
pean powers in the New World. The suggestion was 
forwarded to Washington, where all the cabinet ofﬁ
cers, except Ad
-ams, favored a joint  
An
glo-
American declaration. Adams, on the other 
hand, supported the action but not as a joint undertaking. He wanted 

the United States to make the statement in
de pen
dently. We have “a 
very suitable and con
venient opportunity,” he said, “. . . to take our 
stand against the Holy Alliance and at the same time to decline the 

overture of Great Britain. It would be more candid, as well as more 

digniﬁ
ed, to avow our principles explicitly to Rus
sia and France, than 
to come in as a  
cock-
boat in the wake of the British  
man-
of-
war.” 
A cock-
boat in the wake of the British  
man-
of-
war! That is precisely 
the way it would be perceived by the world. We must not go that route, 

argued Adams. We have to stand up and declare our own position as a 

sovereign, in
de pen
dent nation. The United States, he insisted, should 
openly declare the principles on which this government was founded; it 

should reject the notion of spreading those principles elsewhere by 

force of arms; and it should state emphatically that this nation also ex
-pects Eu
rope to refrain from propagating its principles in this hemi
-sphere or from subjugating “by force any part of these continents to 
the
ir will.” 
These doctrines of non-intervention and  
non-
colonization in the 
New World by any Eu
ropean country, or any other country, formed the 
core of the Monroe Doctrine and  were presented by the President to 

Congress in his annual message rather than in diplomatic dispatches, 

as Adams initially suggested. Much of the message as drafted was 

written by Adams, and it advanced four important doctrines: ﬁ
 rst, the 
American continents 
were no longer to “be considered as subjects for 
future colonization by any Eu
ropean Power”; second, in “wars of the 
European powers in matters pertaining to themselves, we have never 
taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy, so to do”; third, 

the United States would consider any attempt by Eu
ropeans “to extend 
their system to any portion of this Hemi
sphere, as dangerous to our 
peace and safety”; and fourth, with “existing Colonies or dependencies 
86 
a short history of the united states 
of any Eu
ropean power, we have not interfered, and shall not inter
-fere.” 
Secretary Adams enunciated one other doctrine dealing with for
-eign affairs that is not as well known. He used the occasion of a Fourth 
of J
uly oration in 
1821
 to announce it. He delivered his remarks from 
the rostrum of the  
House of Representatives and faced his audience 
dressed in the academic robe of a university professor. Staring point
-edly at his audience, he declared that the United States would always be 

“th
e well-
wisher to the freedom and in
de pen
dence of all” nations but 
that it must not go “abroad in search of monsters to destroy” by enlisting 

under banners other “than our own.” Such a departure by the United 

States from a rational foreign policy would unhappily  
inaugurate 
America’s reach for “dominion and power” in the world and would ul
-timately result in the loss of its own “freedom and in
de pen
dence.” 
Following the war 
of 1812
 the United States experienced not 
only a surge of nationalistic pride and the advent of an industrial revo
-lution but a marked advance in the development of a demo cratic soci
-ety. Universal white manhood suffrage was quickly achieved after 
181
5, prompted by the arrival of many new, western states that placed no 

property or religious restrictions on adult white males. This break
-through in the qualiﬁ
ca
tions for voting encouraged the older, eastern 
states to convene conventions that altered their constitutions and broad
-ened suffrage. These actions  were the ﬁ
rs
t important steps in moving 
the country from a republican to a demo 
cratic government. Several 
more such moves 
remained—such as providing voting and citizenship 
rights to those of a different race and sex. But the country was headed 

in a new direction, although it would take time and even bloodshed to 

achieve a more perfect  
Union. 
Another dynamic force impacting the growth of democracy in the 
Un
ited States was the rise of a  
self-
conscious working class, resulting in 
large part from the growth of factories and the arrival of ever larger 

numbers of immigrants from Eu
rope. They knew what they needed 
and did not hesitate to express their wishes, demanding social, eco
-
nomic, and even po
liti
cal legislation to satisfy their wants. For one 
thing, they demanded the abolition of imprisonment for debt; they 
87 An Emerging Identity 
demanded free public education for their children; and they demanded 
that employers pay the wages that 
were owed and not seek to escape 
their obligations when faced with economic difﬁ
culties. They even 
formed a Workingmen’s Party in Philadelphia and put up candidates 

for public ofﬁ
ce who would advance the rights of the laboring classes. 

They or
ganized strikes in support of higher wages and a  
ten-
hour 
workday. In 
1840
 the federal government adopted the  
ten-
hour 
workday 
for its employees, and two years later Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw of the 

Massachusetts supreme court ruled in 
Commonwealth v. Hunt
 that it 
was legal for workers to form 
unions and go on strike to gain their eco
-nomic goals. 
Now that the people of the United States had achieved a new iden
-tity, which was not British, foreign, or European but distinctly Ameri
-can, changes became apparent in the presidential election of 
1824
. Where in the ﬁ
rst election, back in 
1789
, George Washington took the 
oath of ofﬁ
ce wearing a powdered wig, knee breeches, silk stockings, 
and pumps with silver buckles, a ceremonial sword strapped around his 

waist, the candidates in 
1824
 wore trousers, shirts, and  
neckties. No 
wigs, no breeches, no swords. The sharp changes that had taken place 

in the country 
were revealed not only in the clothes the candidates 
wore but in the way they looked and behaved. Washington was an aris
-tocrat to his ﬁ
ngertips and acted as such. Andrew Jackson, one of the 
candidates in 
1824
, played the role of an ordinary citizen, a demo
crat, 
even though he clearly belonged to the upper class in his home state, 

Tennessee. 
In this presidential election, Monroe did not name a successor, and 
sin
ce only one  
party—the Republican  
Party—existed, the person cho
-sen by the traditional congressional caucus would automatically be 

elect
ed. For that reason, many objections  
were raised about continuing 
the traditional method. In effect it took the election away from the 

people and handed it over to a small group of politicians in Congress. 

Thus in 
1824
, a number of candidates 
were put forth by the state legis
-latures, insisting that “King Caucus,” as they called the traditional 

me
thod, “was dead.” 
Nevertheless, despite these objections, a caucus was held—although 
it w
as sharply reduced in number. It was called by Senator Martin Van 
Buren of New York, who believed that a party system was essential for 
88 
a short history of the united states 
the furtherance of a republican society. The found ers berated parties 
an
d described them as cabals of greedy men seeking their own private 
interests, not the interests of the people at large. But the realistic Van 

Buren understood that men holding par
tic 
ular principles should join 
together in order to advance those principles. It could not be done any 

other way. So he summoned the caucus to meet on February 
14, 1824
, in 
the  
House chamber, but only  
sixty-
six members put in an appearance. 
To the “heavy groans in the Gallery,” packed with friends and enemies 

of the caucus, William H. Crawford, the secretary of the treasury, 

was nominated as the Republican Party’s presidential candidate. He 

received sixty-
two votes, while two  
were given to John Quincy Adams, 
and one apiece to Andrew Jackson and Nathaniel Macon. 
The Speaker of the  
House, Henry Clay, had long proved his talents 
as an elected ofﬁ
cial, so Kentucky put forward his name in nomina
-tion; this was the ﬁ
rst
 of Clay’s many attempts to be elected President. 
Since the ofﬁ
ce of secretary of state had been considered a stepping-
stone to the presidency for the past  
twenty-
four years, Massachusetts 
advanced the name of John Quincy Adams. Another cabinet ofﬁ
 cer, 
Secretary of War John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, decided to run 

but soon found his northern supporters more inclined toward Andrew 

Jackson, so he withdrew as a presidential candidate and accepted a 

nomination as Vice President. Of all the candidates in this election 

Andrew Jackson was the least qualiﬁ
ed in terms of public ser
vice in 
administrative positions. But his successful military career made him 

the most pop 
ular among the electorate, and with so many more Amer
-icans exercising the vote in 
1824 he had no trouble in winning the larg
-est number of pop
ul
ar and electoral votes. Jackson garnered 
152
,901 
pop
ular and  
ninety-
nine electoral votes; Adams came second with 
114
,023
 pop
ular and 
eighty-
four electoral votes. Even though Crawford 
had suffered a debilitating stroke during the campaign, he won 
46,979 pop
ular and  
forty-
one electoral votes. Still, his electoral votes  
were more than what Clay accrued,  
thirty-
seven. Nonetheless Clay’s popu
-lar vote was higher than Crawford’s: it reached 
47,217. Sin
ce no one had 
a majority of electoral votes, as the Constitution required, it was up to 

the  
House to choose the next President. Unfortunately for Clay the 
Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution stated that only the top 

three candidates with the highest electoral votes could be considered 
89 An Emerging Identity 
by the  
House of Representatives in making its decision, and these in
-cluded Jackson, Adams, and Crawford. 
As Speaker and as a man pop 
ul
ar among his colleagues, Clay would 
most certainly have won the contest. Now he was in a position to de
-cide who would be named the chief executive. He let out a sigh. “I 
on
ly wish I could have been spared such a painful duty,” he declared in 
a letter to a friend. But it proved easier than he let on. First, he dismissed 

Jackson as a possible choice because he, Jackson, was a “military chief
-tain” who deﬁed any law that he disliked and gave promise of develop
-ing into an American Napoleon. Besides, Clay’s attack on Jackson’s 

in
vasion of Florida had created an unbridgeable chasm between the 
two men. The Speaker also dismissed Crawford, who was physically 

incapacitated and could not assume the duties of the President. So 

that left Adams, and although he and the secretary had clashed 

previously—especially in Ghent, where they both served as commis
-sioners in arranging the treaty that ended the War of 
1812
—they 
were ardent nationalists, and Adams would certainly endorse Clay’s Amer
-ican System. 
On Sunday, January 
8, 1825
, Clay visited Adams at his home and fol
-lowing a  
thre
e-
hour conversation he made it clear that he would sup
-port the secretary for President. Their meeting became known, and the 

ru
mor spread that they had entered a bargain in which Adams would 
be chosen chief executive and would in return appoint Clay secretary of 

state. It was supposedly a quid pro quo agreement. 
The election took place on February 
9 during a heavy snowstorm. 
The two  
houses of Congress met, counted the electoral ballots, and 
announced that no candidate had a majority. Whereupon the Senate 

withdrew from the chamber and the 
House proceeded to choose the 
next President. Each state had one vote, determined by its delegation. 
The gallery of the  
Ho
use was packed with spectators as the ballot
-ing began. And the choice was decided on the very ﬁ
rs
t ballot. Adams 
received the votes of thirteen states, Jackson seven, and Crawford 

four. 
The result infuriated Jackson. The people had obviously preferred 
hi
m among the several candidates, but their will had been turned aside 
by what was called a “corrupt bargain” between Clay and Adams. Then 

when Adams chose Clay as his secretary of state that action provided 
90 
a short history of the united states 
supposedly irrefutable proof that the election had been rigged by two 
sch
eming,  
power-
hungry “poltroons.” “So you see,” raged Jackson, “the 
Judas of the  
West”—Clay was frequently referred to as “Harry of the 
West”—“has closed the contract and will receive the thirty pieces of 

silver. . . . 
Was there ever witnessed such a bare faced corruption in any 
coun
try before?” 
The Adams-Clay team shrugged off the accusations and set to work 
to enac
t a program that they hoped would advance the welfare of the 
American people, a program based to a large extent on Clay’s Ameri
-can System. But they never had a chance of getting it through Con
-gress. The opposition, who  were mainly Jacksonians, regarded the pair 

as hav
ing unlawfully connived their way to power. Thus when Adams, 
in his ﬁ
rst annual message to Congress in December 
1825
, requested 
the building of a system of roads and canals, the founding of a national 

university and a naval academy similar to West Point, and the “erection 

of an astronomical observatory” to observe the “phenomenon of the 

heavens,” Congress laughed at him. In a burst of nationalistic enthusi
-asm, Adams declared that the “great object of the institution of civil 

govern
ment is the improvement of the condition of those who are par
-ties of the social contract.” He asked the members not to be “palsied by 

th
e will of their constituents.” 
Palsied by the will of their constituents! Forget the will of their con
-stituents is what Adams seemed to be saying, just as he and Clay had 

don
e in cheating Old Hickory out of the presidency. Furthermore, 
Jacksonians thought Adams was mad to offer such proposals. Not only 

did they declare them unconstitutional but ﬁ
 nancially preposterous. 
Only a corrupt administration spawned by a “monstrous  
union” be
-tween what John Randolph called “the puritan and the  
bl
ack-
leg” 
would propose such outlandish nonsense. Clay took offense at Ran-

dolph’s remark and challenged him to a duel. Neither man was injured 

in the ensuing exchange of ﬁ
re, although Clay’s bullet tore through 
Randolph’s trousers. 
Dueling in the United States, said Alexis de Tocqueville, the French 
author
 of Democracy in America
, had become a deadly practice. In Eu
-rope participants intended a duel to be no more than a show of honor, 

whi
ch could be achieved without inﬂ
icting mortal wounds. Not so in 
America. In the United States, Tocqueville said, the participants meant 
91 An Emerging Identity 
to kill each other. For some southerners, such as William Yancey of 
Alabama, “a duel was only a pleasant morning recreation.” 
Over the next several years the differences widened between the 
nat
ionalistic administration and the Jacksonians. The era of rule by a 
single party ended. New parties formed and the  
two-
party system re
-emerged. Under the direction of Senator Martin Van Buren of New 

Yo
rk, with the help of Vice President John C. Calhoun, the opponents 
of the administration aligned themselves in support of the candidacy of 

Jackson for President in the  
upcoming election of 
1828
. They soon took 
the name 
Demo
cratic-Republicans, or Demo
crats, and emphasized 
states’ rights and ﬁ
scal conservatism. The friends of Adams and Clay 
advocated a more active role for the government in addressing domestic 

issues and  
were known as National Republicans. Thus the ill-
termed 
“Era of Good Feelings” passed into history. 
One object of the Adams administration was the imposition of high 
tariffs in order to advance the manufacturing segment of the country. 
The tariff had been increased in 
1824
 but it did not satisfy its propo
-nents. So the  
Ho
use Committee on Manufactures, chaired by Rollin 
C. Mallory of Vermont, a strong protectionist, set about concocting 

a n
ew set of duties. But Mallory and his allies 
were outnumbered 
and outmaneuvered in the committee by Jacksonians, headed by Silas 

Wright Jr. of New York, a close associate of Van Buren. 
The new tariff recommendations, as ﬁ
nal
ly put forward by this 
committee, startled and then outraged the friends of the administra
-tion. 
Here was not a bill to encourage manufactures, but rather, as John 
Randolph rightly described it, a mea
sure to “manufacture a President.” 
The committee, explained Wright to his po
liti
cal friends in New York, 
jacked up the rates on all products from those states Jackson needed to 

win election in 
1828
. At the same time it limited protection on items 
produced by industries from states supporting Adams, particularly 

New En
gland. Consequently woolen goods, produced mainly in Mas
-sachusetts, failed to get the rates necessary to contend against British 

com
petition. How had this happened? Well, explained Wright, the 
committee raised the rates upon “all kinds of woolen cloths” as “high 
as 
our own friends
 in Pennsylvania, Kentucky & Ohio would vote them.” 
Then he jumped the rates on molasses, ﬂax, hemp, and lead to attract 

votes from western states where these products  
were produced. And 
92 
a short history of the united states 
the high duty on iron, he explained, was “the Sine qua non with Penn
-sylvania.” Thus raw materials would be favored by this tariff whereas 
New
 England’s manufactures would not. 
But these duties would hurt southerners, who  
were am
ong Jackson’s 
strongest and most loyal supporters. They wrongly believed that the 

tariff had caused the decline in the price of cotton on the world market. 

Furthermore, they argued, tariffs favored the industrial interests of the 

north, which meant that southerners had to buy their manufactured 

goods on a closed market while selling their tobacco and cotton on 

an open market, and this was unfair. Obviously, the framers of this 

bill felt that they did not have to worry about southern support for 

Jackson—it was inconceivable that southerners would vote for Adams 

in the next 
election—and therefore these framers had no need to grat
-ify their demands to win their allegiance. In 
self-defense southerners 
worked out a scheme to kill the measure. They agreed among them
-selves that if they voted 
in f
avor
 of the provisions advanced by the com
-mittee, the New En
gla
nders and their supporters would coalesce to 
defeat the bill on the ﬁ
 nal vote. 
A series of amendments 
were of
fered to make the measure less odi
-ous by raising rates on manufactured goods and lowering those on raw 

ma
terials. But they went down to defeat, thanks to the scheme hatched 
by southerners. They had no intention of making the bill more accept
-able to northerners. When the amendments failed, many of the south
-erners burst out with loud cheers of jubilation, convinced that the bill 

wa
s now lost. But by their shouts they foolishly revealed their plot to all 
the other members of the  
House. It was obvious, said one, that they 
had “voted for molasses, & some other articles with a view of making 

the Bill odious” to all protectionists, especially New En
glanders. Such 
overt expressions of victory  
were stupid. “We have not only disclosed 
our plan,” groaned Augustine H. Shepperd of North Carolina, “but 

defeated its success.” 
That started the New En
glanders wondering. “Can we go the 
hemp, iron, spirit and molasses,” asked Daniel Webster of Massachusetts, “for 

the sake of any woolen bill?” After many discussions among themselves 

they decided that indeed they could, and on ﬁ
nal passage in the  
House 
on April 
22 the mea
sure received a vote of 
105 to 94. In the Senate the 
93 An Emerging Identity 
rates  
were adjusted to increase the woolen rate to forty percent ad valo
-rum with a ﬁ
ve pe
rcent increase each year until it reached ﬁ
 fty percent. 
The Senate, then, on May 
13, approved these changes, 
26 to 21, and 
sent them back to the 
House, where, after a heated debate, they 
were sustained, 
85 to 44. Adams signed it, and in their fury southerners 
called it a “Tariff of Abominations.” 
Vice President Calhoun returned home when Congress adjourned 
an
d set to work on a document that expressed not only his outrage but 
his argument that the states may nullify any federal law they believed 
violated their basic rights. This “Exposition and Protest” was submit
-ted anonymously to the South Carolina legislature, where it was passed. 

Th
e document advanced the doctrine of nulliﬁ
cation, which Calhoun 
hoped would be the means by which states could protect their interests 

without resorting to secession. 
Adams also announced in his ﬁ
rst a
nnual message that a congress of 
the newly in
de pen
dent states of Latin America had been called by Si
-mon Bolivar, the great liberator of South America, and would be held 

in
 Panama to discuss matters of common concern and interest. He 
further announced that the United States had been invited to attend 

and that he had accepted the invitation. Democrats took sharp excep
-tion to the information, insisting that the conference departed from the 

es
tablished foreign policy of the United States. Furthermore, they 
planned to reject the nominations of the two ministers to the Panama 

Congress that the President had sent to the Senate for conﬁ
 rmation. In 
setting forth the advantages of participating in the conference, Adams 

underscored the importance of promoting “liberal commercial inter
-course” with Latin American countries. Most particularly, he said, the 

mis
sion would demonstrate to South American countries “the interest 
that we take in their welfare” and provide the foundation on which 

could be built “the most cordial feelings of fraternal friendship.” 
The Jacksonians would have none of it. Conﬁ
rma
tion of the two 
ministers was delayed so long that the Panama Congress had adjourned 

before they arrived. One of the ministers died en route; the other had 

only reached Mexico City when the conference ended. 
It was a lost opportunity, a chance that a long history of cooperation 
an
d interaction between the North and South American continents 
94 
a short history of the united states 
could have been initiated. Politics, as would happen again and again 
ov
er the years, canceled the makings of something that might have 
advanced the welfare of all the parties involved. 
Because of politics, the Adams administration left a very thin record 
of ac
hievements when placed against the things it had hoped to achieve 
at the outset. Tagged as corrupt, Adams and Clay could not silence or 

disprove these accusations to the satisfaction of most Americans. In 

running for reelection in 
1828
 Adams went down to defeat in one of the 
ﬁlthiest elections in American history. Jackson was accused of stealing 
another man’s wife when he had married Rachel Donelson Robards, 

who thought she was divorced from her ﬁ
rst husband, Lewis Robards, 
but was not. She was still married to Robards at the time she married 

Jackson and was therefore technically a bigamist. Also, Jackson’s 

mother was accused of being a prostitute who had been brought to 

this country to ser
vice British soldiers. Adams, on the other hand, was 
called a pimp. Supposedly, he had procured an American girl for the 

czar when he served as U.S. minister to Russia. 
It was all very ugly and ended when Jackson swept the South, West, 
and Northwest for a total of 
178
 electoral votes to Adams’s 
83 votes, 
almost all of which came from New En
gland. Out of a population of 
approximately 
13 million, 
1,155,340
 went to the polls, an increase of 
800
,000 voters over the last election. Of that number Jackson received 
647,276
 votes and Adams 
508
,064
. The country had changed. The Republic was evolving into a de
-mocracy, but the pro cess would be long, difﬁ
cu
lt, and even bloody. 
4The Jacksonian Era
Thousands of people
 crowded into Washington on March 
4, 1829
, to witness the inauguration of President Andrew Jackson. 
It seemed “like the inundation of the northern barbarians into Rome, 
save that the tumultuous tide came in from a different point of the 

compass.” Many could not understand what was happening. Daniel 

Webster was positively shocked. “I never saw such a crowd  
here be
-fore,” he said. “Person have come ﬁve hundred miles to see General 

Jac
kson, 
and they really seem to think that the country is rescued from some 
dreadful danger
.” Actually they had come to celebrate the inauguration of their hero, a 
man l
ike so many of them who had achieved success in America. Born 
in poverty, without an immediate family for the ﬁ
rst part of his life, he 
had risen to the highest ofﬁ
ce in the country. To ordinary citizens, he 

represented what was exceptional and exciting about America. He was 

a “self-
made man,” a term invented at this time to describe those who 
had achieved fame and fortune through their own efforts without 

the assistance of family or wealth. Ambition and determination could 

guarantee success to anyone who made the effort. 
The crowd shook the ground with screams and applause as the hero 
appeared on the east portico of the Capitol and took the oath of ofﬁ
 ce. And when the ceremony ended, the people pursued him as he made his 

way to the Executive Mansion. They poured into the  
building—men, 
women, and children “scrambling, ﬁ
 ghting, romping.” The “
Majesty of 
the People
 had disappeared,” wrote Mrs. Samuel H. Smith, wife of the 
96 
a short history of the united states 
editor of a leading Washington newspaper, and in its place there ap
-peared a rabble herd of the lowest society. “The President, after having 

been 
literally
 nearly pressed to death & almost suffocated & torn to 
pieces by the people in their eagerness to shake hands with Old Hick
-ory, had retreated through the back way or south front & had escaped 

to
 his lodgings at Gadsby’s.” 
Refreshments had been prepared for the reception, but each time 
th
e waiters attempted to enter a room to serve the guests, a mob rushed 
forward to seize the drinks. An orange punch, laced with hard liquor, 

was pitched to the ﬂ
oor moments after being brought through the pan
-try door. Cut glass and china  
were smash
ed in the melee. The general 
destruction had reached such a level that tubs of punch, wine, and ice 

cream  
were ﬁnally taken to the garden outside in the hope that they 
would draw the crowd out of the mansion. And it worked. Men dived 

through the windows in hot pursuit, and children wrestled and fought 

with each other in their effort to grab the ice cream and other refresh
-ments. In their distress on witnessing such behavior, women fainted. 

“W
e had a regular Saturnalia,” exclaimed one congressman. The mob 
was “one uninterrupted stream of mud and ﬁ
lth
. . . . However not
-withstanding the row Demos kicked up the  whole matter went off very 

we
ll thro the 
wise neglect
 of that great apostle ‘of the ﬁ
 erce democracy,’ 
the Chairman of the Central Committee, which body corporate so far 

from being defunct by the election of Old Hickory seems now to have 

gathered fresh vitality and has I believe even taken the old man under 

their parental guardianship.” 
The Central Committee. It was a new age, a demo 
cra
tic age. Many 
more 
people—that is, white  
males—had won the suffrage, and now 
politicians formed committees to guide and direct them to the polls so 

that large majorities could be built for favored candidates. Politics en
-couraged the use of parades and barbecues to attract public interest. 

Hi
ckory poles  
were erected in town squares to salute and celebrate the 
accomplishments of the “Hero of New Orleans.” Newspapers 
were not 

only a source of information about local, national, and world events and 

a means of deﬁ
ning party doctrine, be it Demo
cratic or National Re
-publican, but a way of assisting the formation of organizations to 

adva
nce the parties’ po
liti
cal goals. Hundreds of new journals had 
appeared during the election of 
1828
, so that about 
600 newspapers 
97 The Jacksonian Era 
circulated in various parts of the United States: ﬁ
fty of them dailies, 
150
 semiweeklies, and 
400
 weeklies. “I had a meeting of 
12 to 15 friends . . .  
at my 
house last eve
ning,” bragged William L. Marcy, one 
of Van Buren’s most trusted lieutenants in New York, “& arrangements 
were made to publish and distribute extensively some of the best things 

that have appeared against the [Adams] administration and in favor of 

Genl Jackson.” 
So efﬁ
 cient 
were these editors and writers that after Old Hickory’s 
victory they descended on Washington like vultures, looking for their 

reward. Among them  
were Isaac Hill from New Hampshire, Nathan
-iel Greene from Massachusetts, Gideon Welles from Connecticut, 

Mo
rdecai Noah from New York, and Amos Kendall from Kentucky. 
They became party spokesmen, and for their efforts they received po
-liti
cal appointments or lucrative contracts for public printing, or both. 
Everything about politics changed in this Jacksonian era. When the 
gover
nment ﬁrst got under way in 
1789
 most, if not all, congressmen 
spent only one or two terms in public ser
vice, after which they returned 
to their regular professions back home. By and large, government was 

not a means of making money; nor was it regarded as a lifetime career. 

That changed after the War of 
1812
. Now congressmen served longer 
terms and fashioned their ser
vice into a proﬁ
table career. But this ne
-cessitated winning  
elect
ions—every two years in the case of represen
-tatives in the  
Ho
use—which could best be achieved by creating strong 
politi
cal organizations within the states or districts and making certain 
that one’s constituents 
were pleased with one’s per
formance. Not sur
-prisingly, these needs produced a number of unfortunate consequences: 

th
e pork barrel, conﬂ
icts of interest, and  
wholesale bribery. True, these 
practices probably occurred early in legislative history, but with the 

advent of democracy they developed rapidly over a long period of time. 

Lobbyists became more apparent and more insistent in representing 

their clients. 
The type and character of the individuals who ran for ofﬁ
 ce a
lso 
changed—and not necessarily for the better. A  wider-
based electorate 
encouraged the candidacy of many men who really lacked the educa
-tion and knowledge and background to serve in Congress. Alexis de 

To
cqueville, the author of 
Democracy in America
, attended sessions of 
both the 
House and the Senate and was appalled by what he witnessed. 
98 
a short history of the united states 
“On entering the  
Ho
use of Representatives at Washington,” he re
-ported, “one is struck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. 
Of
ten there is not a distinguished man in the  
whole number. Its mem
-bers are almost all obscure individuals, whose names bring no associa
-tions to mind. They are mostly village lawyers, men in trade, or even 

pe
rsons belonging to the lower classes of society.” Indeed, the 
New York 
Tribune
 reported that Representative William Sawyer of Ohio was one 
such member of the lower class. He regularly left his seat in the  House 

at one  
o’clock in the afternoon and went to a window with a recess, 
opened a bundle wrapped in newspaper, and pulled out a sausage for 

lunch. He would devour the sausage, then brush away the crumbs, dis
-pose of the newspaper, and return to his seat. A man of rustic manners, 

decl
ared the 
Tribune
, from “some backwoods benighted region in 
Ohio”—this was the new type of legislator that now sat in Congress 

and framed the nation’s laws. Contrast Sawyer with such men as Mad
-ison, Ames, Sedgewick, and Mühlenberg et al. who sat in the  House 

ear
lier and helped establish the government under the Constitution, 
and the marked change in the operation of the government  becomes 

immediately apparent. Such a change in just a few years, marveled 

some. Contemporaries worried that the increase in the suffrage had 

lowered the standards for running for elective ofﬁ
 ce. The most obvious change was Jackson himself. He followed a dis
-tinguished line of public servants from Washington to Adams, all men 

of
 outstanding public ser
vice. And Jackson had a nickname: Old Hick
-ory. None of his pre
deces sor
s possessed such a  
nickname—but many of 
the Presidents who followed him did, such as Martin Van Buren, 

known as the “Little Magician”; or William Henry Harrison, dubbed 

“Tippecanoe”; James Knox Polk, called “Young Hickory”; and Zach
-ary Taylor, known as “Old Rough and Ready.” To many commentators 

at
 the time, this use of a new kind of nomenclature surely marked a 
decline, in their minds, in the caliber of men who served as President 

of the United States. With the possible exception of Polk, none of them 

could be regarded as 
ﬁ rst-
rate statesmen. 
Still, Andrew Jackson proved to be one of the most outstanding chief 
ex
ecutives in U.S. history. He had a reform program that he asked 
Congress to enact into law. In his ﬁ
rst message he proposed a constitu
-tional amendment to replace the electoral system with a pop 
ular
 vote, 
99 The Jacksonian Era 
so that the “fair expression of the will of the majority” would decide 
who serves as President. As a ﬁ
rm believer in democracy, he preached a 
simple deﬁ
nition of what that meant. “The people are the government,” 
he said, “administering it by their agents; they are the Government, the 

sovereign power.” In this message he reiterated his claim that “
the ma
-jority is to govern
.” A
mending the Constitution to abolish the College of 
Electors would ensure that the disastrous election of 
1824
–1825 
would 
never be repeated. 
He also hoped to settle existing differences with foreign countries, 
in p
ar
tic 
ular the money due to Americans for property depredations 
during the Napoleonic Wars. These obligations by Eu
rope had been 
disregarded for de 
cades and he had every intention of collecting what 
foreign nations owed American citizens. He also expected to root out 

the corruption that he believed had seeped into the government during 

the previous administration. To accomplish this he applied a reformed 

policy of appointment to ofﬁ
ce, a policy his opponents called a “spoils 
system.” “Rotation in ofﬁ
ce,” is what he called it. “There has been a 
great noise made about removals,” he declared. Those who have been 

in ofﬁ
ce for a few years think they have a vested right to it. “In a coun
-try where ofﬁ
 ces are created solely for the beneﬁ
t of the people no one 
man has any more intrinsic right to ofﬁ
cial station than another.” It is 
by a periodic rotation of men in ofﬁ
ce that we can “best perpetuate our 
liberty.” 
Furthermore, he thought the tariff should be readjusted to a more 
“m
iddle and just” level so that all sections of the country might beneﬁ
 t. Obviously the Tariff of Abominations had created considerable contro
-versy, especially in the South, and Jackson believed that appropriate 

“a
djustments” could and should be undertaken. Most particularly he 
believed that the Indian tribes should be moved beyond the Mississippi 

River for their own  
safety—to escape probable  
annihilation—and more 
particularly for the safety of the nation. As far as he was concerned 

the presence of Indians in certain parts of the country, especially the 

Southeast, jeopardized the ability of the nation to defend itself. Finally, 

he wanted changes in the operation of the Second Bank of the United 

States inasmuch as it had failed, he said, to establish “a uniform and 

sound currency.” Only with such changes would it be possible to “pre
-vent our liberties” from being “crushed by the Bank & its inﬂ
 uence.” 
100 a short history of the united states 
After an unfortunate interlude in which a constitutional crisis re
-sulted from the ostracizing of Peggy  O’Neale Eaton, the wife of his 
secreta
ry of war, John H. Eaton, because of her reputation as a “scan
-dalous woman,” the President shufﬂ
ed hi
s cabinet to gain the kind of 
support he needed to enact his reforms. He defended Peggy, as he had 

his wife, seeing her as a victim of malicious troublemakers within the 

administration who would use an innocent woman to gain what
ever 
advantage they could to control the operation of government. 
The ﬁ
 rst important bill to be enacted under Jackson’s guidance was 
the Indian Removal Act of 
1830
. Because Native Americans  
were a threat to the safety and security of the  nation—the Creek War during 

the War of 
1812
 was a prime  
example—they had to be relocated to an 
area where they could do no harm. He also believed that unless they 

were removed they would be exterminated by white settlers who wanted 

their land and  
were prepared to wage an exterminating war to obtain it. 
The disappearance during the past 
100
 years of such tribes as the Ya
-massee, the Delaware, and the Mohicans and others convinced him 

that the same fate would befall the Creek, Chickasaw, Cherokee, 
Choctaw, and Seminole, the  
so-called Five Civilized Nations, if they 
remained where they 
were. The Removal Act provided funds to negotiate with these tribes and 
re
locate them to the West. It called for the creation of an Indian Terri
-tory, which later became the state of Oklahoma, and within which 

each t
ribe would occupy a select area and govern itself without interfer
-ence from the United States. The removal would involve the signing of 

tr
eaties in which there was an exchange of equivalent amounts of 
land—eastern land where the tribes now resided for western land be
-yond the Mississippi River. The federal government would provide 

tr
ansport, food, and some tools to ease the transition of the Indians to 
their new homes. Some tribes submitted without a ﬁ
ght. But others did 
not—notably the Cherokee who  
were undoubtedly the most “civi
-lized” of the Indians, boasting schools, a written language, a newspa
-per, and a constitution. So civilized  
were th
ey that, like white men, 
they even held slaves. Ultimately they took their complaint to the 

U.S. 
Supreme Court, insisting that they 
were a sovereign, i
nde pen
dent 
nation. 
Th
e case developed when the state of Georgia imposed its laws on 
Removal of the Five Southern Indian Tribes, 1830-1834
102 
a short history of the united states 
the Cherokee living within its boundaries. In 
Cher
okee Nation v. Geor
-gia, Chief Justice John Marshall decreed that the tribe was not subject 
to state laws, but he also denied that it was sovereign and in
de pen
dent. 
Rather, the Cherokee 
were wards of the federal government. They 
were, he declared, “domestic dependents in a state of pupilage.” 
Georgia, of course, paid no attention to the ruling and had the 
im
plicit approval of President Jackson. The Georgia legislature fol
-lowed through by prohibiting white men from entering Indian territory 
wi
thout the state’s explicit permission. Two  
missionaries—Samuel 
Worcester and Dr. Elizur 
Butler—refused to comply and  
were impris
-oned. They sued and in the case 
Worcester v. Georgia
 th
e Supreme 
Court ruled against the state and ordered it not to interfere. Where
-upon Jackson stepped in and pressured the governor of Georgia, Wil
-son Lumpkin, to free the missionaries at the same time he urged the 

Ind
ians to move. Through fraud and chicanery, a removal 
treaty—the 
Treaty of New  
Echota—was approved by the Cherokee Nation and the 
tribe was rounded up, its members held in stockades while they awaited 

transport, and then hurried westward along what the Indians called a 

“Trail of Tears.” It was an 
800
-mile journey of sickness, misery, and 
death. Some 
18,000 Cherokee 
were removed from their homeland, and 
4,000 of them died along the way. 
One reason Jackson was anxious to settle the quarrel with Georgia 
wa
s the fact that a greater crisis had developed with South Carolina, and 
the President wanted to bring it to a speedy conclusion without provok
-ing civil war. The last thing he needed was a confrontation with Geor
-gia when he was about to face down the nulliﬁ
ers i
n South Carolina. 
The quarrel began over passage of the Tariff of Abominations and 
th
e doctrine put forward anonymously by Calhoun that the states 
could reject federal laws which violated their rights. This notion of 

“interposition” would protect minority rights, declared Calhoun, and 

prevent the tyranny of the majority, always a danger in a demo 
cratic 
society. States must remain strong so that they can block the central 

government from assuming absolute authority. It was an additional 

check in a federal system of checks and balances. It was the only way of 

protecting liberty and individual rights. 
These views received a thorough airing in January 
1830, at the very 
start of Jackson’s administration, when Daniel Webster of Massachu
-103 The Jacksonian Era 
setts and Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina got into a ﬁ
erce debate on 
the Senate ﬂ
oor over the nature of the  
Union. Hayne defended the 
Calhoun doctrine and argued that the  
Union could last only if the 
rights of the 
states—including their right to hold slaves—were  
respected 
and protected. The national government was nothing but the agent of 
the states. States 
were sovereign, and the  
Union was simply a compact of 
states. 
Webster countered in his famous second reply to Hayne, in which 
he
 denied that the 
Union was a confederation of states. Rather, it was a 
Union of people. “I go for the Constitution as it is, and for the  
Union as 
it is,” he thundered. “It is, Sir, the people’s Constitution, the people’s 

government, made for the people, made by the people, and answerable 

to the people.” As for the argument that liberty can be safeguarded 

only by strengthening the states, Webster insisted that individual lib
-erty depended on the perpetuation of the 
Un
ion. “Liberty and  
Union,” 
he cried, “now and forever, one and inseparable.” 
Jackson thoroughly agreed. At a commemorative celebration to 
ho
nor Thomas Jefferson on April 
13, 1830
, many dignitaries 
were pres
-ent, including Calhoun. Several toasts were offered, and Jackson pro
-posed the ﬁ
rst. Acco
rding to tradition he looked squarely at Calhoun 
and said, “Our 
Union, 
it must be preserved
.” Calhoun responded with, 
“Our 
Union, next to our liberty, the most dear; may we all remember 
that it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the States and 

distributing equally the beneﬁ
t and burden of the  
Union.” Jackson later 
allowed the word “federal” to be added to his toast, so that it declared, 

“Our federal 
Union, 
it must be preserved
.” Congress attempted to settle the problem by passing the Tariff of 
183
2, which removed some of the abominations of the Tariff of 
1828
. But it merely 
modiﬁ
ed—it did not appreciably  
lower—the rates, and 
the effort proved unsatisfactory to the nulliﬁ
ers. Whereupon the gov
-ernor of South Carolina called a special session of the state legislature, 

whi
ch in turn ordered an elected convention to meet on November 
19, 1832
, to take appropriate action. When this convention assembled, the 
nulliﬁ
ers proposed and obtained passage of an Ordinance of Nulliﬁ
 ca-tion on November 
24 by a vote o
f 136
 to 26, declaring the tariff laws 
of 1828
 and 
1832
 to be “null, void, and no law, nor binding” on South 
Carolina, its ofﬁ
cers, or its citizens. 
104 
a short history of the united states 
This was quite a challenge. The convention further decreed that 
afte
r February 
1, 1833
, it would be unlawful to collect the tariff duties 
imposed by the nulliﬁ
ed law, and warned the federal government 
against attempting to force compliance, threatening secession and the 

establishment of a “separate Government.” 
Jackson responded immediately with a Proclamation on December 
10, 183
2, in which he reminded the people of South Carolina, his native 
state, that as President he had the duty and responsibility of enforcing 

the laws of the United States. “Those who told you that you might 

peacefully prevent their execution deceived you
. . . . 
Disunion by armed 
fo
rce is 
treason
. Are you really ready to incur its guilt? . . .  
On your un
-happy State will inevitably fall all the evils of the conﬂ
ic
t you force 
upon the Government of your country.” 
More importantly, Jackson declared, “I consider . . . 
th
e power to 
annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, 
incompatible 

with the existence of the Union
.” The people, not the states, he went on, 
formed the  
Union. The people are the sovereign power, and the  Union 
is perpetual. Jackson was the ﬁ
rst President to announce publicly that 
the  
Union is indivisible, a position endorsed by some Americans at the 
time but certainly not by all. To southerners especially, the right of se
-cession was fundamental in a free society. 
In the interim Calhoun resigned as Vice President and had himself 
elect
ed to the Senate, where he hoped to block any action the govern
-ment might attempt against his state. Henry Clay, now a senator from 

Ke
ntucky, was also anxious to prevent bloodshed, and through his 
skillful handling of a new tariff bill succeeded in satisfying the nulli
-ﬁers. The Tariff of 
1833
 provided a 
ten-
year truce during which rates 
would slowly fall until, at the end of that period, duties would stand 

at a uniform twenty percent ad valorum rate and remain there. Jack
-son signed both this Compromise Tariff and a Force Bill that gave 

hi
m the authority to deploy the military to put down any attempt at 
armed rebellion. 
South Carolina quickly convened another convention and expressed 
it
s approval of the Compromise by repealing its Ordinance of Nulliﬁ
 -cation. But it showed its deﬁ
an
ce by nullifying the Force Bill. “If this is 
to be no more than a swaggering conclusion of a blustering drama,” 

snorted the 
Washington Globe
, the administration’s mouthpiece, “it will 
105 The Jacksonian Era 
speedily be consigned to the contempt of an enlightened and patriotic 
public.” 
“Nulliﬁ
cation is dead,” Jackson rightly concluded. But the danger 
inherent in the controversy still lingered on. “The next pretext,” he 
warned, “will be the negro or slavery question.” 
At t he t ime 
he is
sued his Proclamation of December 
10, Jackson 
had just won reelection as President over Henry Clay. The major issue 
of the campaign involved the rechartering of the Second National 

Bank of the United States (BUS). It had developed when the President, 

in his ﬁ
rst annual message to Congress, had asked for changes in the 
operation of the BUS. Headquartered in Philadelphia with 
twenty-
six 
branches throughout the country, the institution was run by a board of 

twenty-
ﬁve directors, of whom ﬁ
 ve were appointed by the government 
and the rest  
were chosen by stockholders. But the actual manager of 
the Bank’s 
affairs was its president, Nicholas Biddle, a  
well-
educated, 
extremely intelligent scion of a wealthy and socially prominent Phila
-delphia  
family. 
Congress paid no mind to the President’s call for changes, because 
hi
s claim that it had failed to provide the nation with sound credit and 
currency was patently untrue. But a more important reason for Jack-

son’s hostility arose from his distrust of speculation and paper money, a 

distrust that emanated from a horrible experience he endured as a 

young man, when he almost landed in debtors’ prison. And lately he 

began to notice that the BUS used its inﬂ
uence and money to arrange 

the election of individuals who  
were friendly toward it and would sup
-port its interests. Furthermore, as someone totally dedicated to the 

sovereign
ty of the people, he felt that the Bank tended to serve the in
-terests of the wealthier classes in America at the expense of ordinary 

citi
zens. 
The matter ﬁ
na
lly came to a head when Henry Clay proposed that 
Congress renew the Bank’s charter four years before it was due to ex
-pire. He had a po
liti
cal objective. He thought this might provide the 
issue by which he could defeat Old Hickory in the presidential election 

of 1832
. He ﬁ
gured that if Jackson signed the legislation it would end 
all the nonsense about improving the institution. But if he vetoed it, 
106 a short history of the united states 
then Clay could challenge Jackson in the election and accuse him of 
dest
roying a necessary ﬁ
nancial institution, one that provided the peo
-ple with sound credit and currency. Clay was certain that citizens 

woul
d never permit the destruction of the BUS; that they would chose 
him over Old Hickory; and that he, as President, would then sign a 

new rechartering bill. 
So a bank bill was introduced in January 
183
2, and by July it had 
passed both 
houses of Congress. On July 
10 Jackson sent it back with a 
ringing veto, one of the most important presidential vetoes in American 

history. What it did was open new ground for a President to reject a bill. 

Previously, all vetoes cited a constitutional reason for rejection of a bill. 

In the present veto, Jackson did include his constitutional objection, but 

he also went far beyond that. He cited po
liti
cal, economic, and social 
reasons for his action. He argued that by this charter the government 

had granted the Bank monopolistic advantages, where by right it should 

act as an honest broker among all classes and all interests. He accused 

the BUS of interfering in the electoral pro 
cess by  
favoring certain can
-didates over others, and thus tampering with the demo 
cratic system of 
government. Moreover, some of its investors  were foreigners, which 

meant that they were enriched from the proﬁ
ts provided by American 
taxpayers. He also challenged the decision of the Supreme Court about 

the Bank’s constitutionality. In 
McCulloch v. Maryland
, Chief Justice 
John Marshall agreed with Alexander Hamilton’s contention that Con
-gress possessed an implied power to create the Bank inasmuch as it was 

“n
ecessary and proper” to fulﬁ
ll the legislature’s enumerated responsi
-bilities. “To this conclusion,” said Jackson in his veto message, “I cannot 

as
sent.” Both Congress and the President “must each for itself be guided 
by its own opinion of the Constitution
. . . . 
The authority of the Su
-preme Court must not be permitted to control the Congress or the Ex
-ecutive when acting in their legislative capacities, but to have only such 

inﬂ
uence as the force of their reasoning may deserve.” 
He ended his message with a dynamite passage. “It is to be regretted 
th
at the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to 
their selﬁ
sh purposes.” When the laws attempt to make “the rich richer, 
and the potent more powerful,” he continued, “the humble members of 

society—the farmers, the mechanics, and  
laborers—who have neither 
the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a 
107 
The Jacksonian Era 
right to complain of the injustice of their Government.” Government 
must treat all equally, rich and poor, and this Bank bill constitutes a 

“wide and unnecessary” departure from that principle. 
What Jackson did was put Congress on notice that he was a partici
-pant in the legislative pro 
ces
s. Since he could invalidate a bill for any 
reason—not simply the dubious constitutionality of a 
measure—it 
behooved legislators to check with the President to see if he had any 

objection to their intended action. If they did not, if they disregarded 

his authority in the matter, they risked a veto, which, under ordinary 

circumstances, is extremely difﬁ
cult to override, since it needs a 
two-
thirds vote from both 
houses of Congress. 
Friends of the BUS  
were ap
palled. It was a “manifesto of anarchy,” 
snarled Nicholas Biddle, “such as Marat and Robespierre might have 

issued to the mobs” during the French Revolution. Senator Daniel 

Webster was incensed. Jackson, he thundered, “claims for the Presi
-dent, not the power of approval, but the primary power of originating 

la
ws.” Naturally, Clay agreed. The message, he said, was “a perversion 
of the veto power.” 
The found
ers o
f this country, in writing the Constitution, had at
-tempted to make Congress the centerpiece of government.  
Her
e Jack
-son attempted to alter that arrangement by making the President the 

he
ad of government. “Congress is the 
demo cratic
 branch of the govern
-ment,” said the 
Nat
ional Intelligencer
, not the executive. “If power is safe 
anywhere in a Republic it is safe with the representatives.” 
Madison’s claim that the executive was the weaker branch of gov
-ernment had suddenly changed. The reverse was now true. “We have 

ar
rived at a new epoch,” declared Webster. “We are entering on ex
-periments with the government and the Constitution, hitherto untried, 

an
d of fearful and appalling aspect.” 
Shortly after Jackson defeated Clay in the presidential election of 
183
2, he decided to remove the government’s deposits from the BUS. 
When his secretary of the treasury refused to carry out his order and 

refused to resign, Jackson ﬁ
red him, the ﬁ
rst cabinet ofﬁ
cer to be so 
removed. And this was an important ﬁ
 rst. It meant that the President 
had absolute control over the entire administrative apparatus. 
In the pro 
cess of withdrawing government funds from the BUS, the 
administration drew out the money it needed to operate while new 
108 
a short history of the united states 
revenues  
were deposi
ted in selected state banks in the major cities, 
called “pet” banks by the opposition. In retaliation, Biddle ordered a 
general curtailment of loans throughout the banking system. He re
-fused to increase discounts, and he restricted discounted bills of ex
-change to ninety days. “This worthy President thinks that because he 

has sc
alped Indians and imprisoned  
Judges”—this was a reference to 
Jackson’s imprisonment of Judge Dominick Hall for issuing a writ of 

habeas corpus to release a journalist in deﬁ
ance of Jackson’s order es
-tablishing martial law in New Orleans in 
181
5—“he is to have his way 
with the Bank. He is mistaken.” As a result of Biddle’s actions the 

country was pitched into a sharp recession in the winter of 
1833
–1834
. Meanwhile the Senate, under the prodding of Henry Clay, passed a 
re
solution on March 
28, 1834
, censuring Jackson for assuming “upon 
himself authority and power not conferred by the Constitution and laws, 

but in derogation of both.” The vote was 
26 to 20. Outraged, the Presi
-dent ﬁ
red back a “
Protest” on April 
15, denying the Senate’s right under 
the Constitution to “take up, consider, and decide upon the ofﬁ
 cial acts 
of the President.” Impeachment is the exclusive right of the  House of 

Representatives, he went on, and the Senate cannot attempt what in ef
-fect is a resolution of impeachment. He then added something that had 

been im
plicit in many of his previous actions and messages: that he was 
the direct representative of all the people and responsible to them. 
Along with many other senators, Daniel Webster denounced Jack-
son
’s “outrageous contentions.” Where is the “authority for saying the 
President is 
the direct representative of the People
? . . . I hold this, Sir, to 
be a mere assumption, and dangerous assumption.” If he is allowed to 

claim that he is the “SOLE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMER
-ICAN PEOPLE, then, I say, Sir, that the government . . . 
has a
lready 
a master. I deny the sentiment . . .  
and protest the language.” 
It was during this prolonged controversy over the BUS, the transfer 
of go
vernment deposits to pet banks, and the censure motion that a 
new party arose from the remnants of the Federalist and National Re
-publican parties, along with some nulliﬁ
ers a
nd those who abominated 
Jackson’s policies and conduct. They called themselves Whigs, a refer
-ence to those in their colonial past who opposed the king and sup
-ported republican rule. They dubbed Jackson “King Andrew,” and 

vowed to o
verturn all his works. 
109 
The Jacksonian Era 
Jackson, during his two terms in ofﬁ
ce, actually redeﬁ
ned the role of 
the President, placing him squarely at the head of the government. 
And this redeﬁ
nition won immediate ac 
ceptance by the electorate. 
Sighed one senator, “Until the President developed the faculties of the 

Executive power, all men thought it inferior to the  
legislature—he 
manifestly thinks it superior; and in his hands the monarchical part 

of the Government (for the Executive is monarchical . . . 
) has proved 
far stronger than the representatives of the States.” The President, not 

Congress, had become the instrument of the pop ular 
will. 
Biddle’s action in 
initiating a ﬁ
nancial panic proved to the 
American people that they did not want an unelected controller of the 

nation’s ﬁ
nances with power to dictate to the government and force it 
into 
submission. The  
House of Representatives agreed. Under Demo
-cratic leadership, it passed a series of resolutions that condemned the 

Ban
k for calling in loans and attempting to force a recharter by ﬁ
 nan
-cial pressure. The  
Ho
use rejected rechartering, advised that govern
-ment funds be kept in the pet banks, and called for an investigation of 

th
e operations of the BUS and the causes of the ﬁ
nancial panic. And 
that about killed the bank. “The Bank is dead,” ventured one cabinet 

ofﬁ
cer. It had proved itself unworthy of trust. Jackson, of course, was 
delighted. “I have obtained a glorious triumph,” he exulted. The House 

resolutions “has put to death that mammoth of corruption and power, 

the Bank of the United States.” 
To a very large extent this “Bank War,” as it has been called, was a 
po
wer struggle between Andrew Jackson, who represented demo 
cratic 
government as he understood it, and Nicholas Biddle, who represented 

privilege and ﬁ
 nancial 
control. And the issue was whether elected of
-ﬁcials or captains of industry would determine the direction and future 
course of the country. In a real sense it was a question of whether this 
nation could survive as a democracy if private, unaccountable concen
-trations of wealth 
we
re more powerful than demo
cratically elected 
ofﬁ
cials of the government. And this power struggle has inﬂ
 uenced 
reformers and progressives throughout the history of the United States. 

Again and again, it has happened that individuals and groups have at
-tempted to use the government to advance their special interests, and at 
110 
a short history of the united states 
times they have gotten away with it. Only a vigilant electorate can pre
-vent this. Today lobbyists regularly corrupt congressmen to better serve 

th
eir clients, and the people suffer as a result. 
In addition, Jackson’s action and claims altered the relationship 
between t
he executive and the electorate. Insisting on his position as 
representative of all the people, Jackson created a national power base 

on which presidential authority could securely rest. When he opted to 

destroy the BUS and Congress thwarted his will, he turned to the 

people and asked for their support. This was the ﬁ
rst time in American 
history that a major issue was taken to the people for resolution. That 

is rarely done, even today. People hate to decide issues. They are not 

always certain they are competent to decide momentous questions. 

Members of Congress are chosen to perform this duty and are paid 

accordingly. But in 
1832
 the future of the Bank rested on whether the 
electorate would choose Jackson or Clay. In favoring Old Hickory so 

decisively, the people rallied to him and give him a mandate to destroy 

the BUS, or so he claimed, despite ﬁ
erce congressional opposition. 
Presidential power had been buttressed by mass support. The executive 

ofﬁ
ce would never be the same again. All it takes is a President with 
determination, pop 
ular support, and leadership skills to direct both 
domestic and foreign policy and decide the future course of American 

history. 
Unfortunately, pet banks did not and could not replace a function
-ing central bank so that the nation’s currency and credit would be 

respected throughout the world. For almost 
100
 years the nation did 
without central banking, until passage of the Federal Reserve System 

during the administration of Woodrow Wilson. Out from under the 

control of the BUS, state banks enjoyed considerable freedom and took 

advantage of it by irresponsibly issuing paper money without adequate 

security. To stop this inﬂ
ation of the currency, Jackson issued his Spe
-cie Circular in 
1836
, whi
ch required gold and silver for the purchase of 
land from the government. One of the most important components of 

the economy was the sale of public land. Neverthel
ess, the continued 
ﬂood of paper currency helped sustain and augment industrial growth 
and the expansion of the country. 
But disaster soon struck. Jackson was not two weeks from leaving 
th
e presidency to his successor, Martin Van Buren, who won election 
111 The Jacksonian Era 
over such Whigs as Daniel Webster, Hugh L. White, and William 
Henry Harrison, when the nation suffered a ﬁ
nancial collapse. On 
March 
17, 1837
, the I. and L. Joseph Company of New York, one of the 
largest dealers in domestic exchange, went bankrupt because of the 

failure of the New Orleans cotton market. This set off a chain reaction 

in which many banks and a variety of commercial and mercantile en
-terprises collapsed. Over the next several months many other bank
-ruptcies followed, and this Panic of 
1837
 was so severe that it lasted for 
the remainder of the de 
cade and well in the 
1840
s. Va n Bu r en spen t 
his entire administration trying to cope with 

th
is depression, but the best he could do was win passage of the In
de-pen
dent  
Treasury—a “divorce” or subtrea
sury plan—which required 
that public money be managed by the government itself without the 

assistance of private banks. Deposits of cash would be stored in subtrea
-sury buildings in the leading cities of the country and withdrawn as 

ne
eded by the government. This plan was repealed in John Tyler’s ad
-ministration, which followed Van Buren’s, but was reenacted in the 

adm
inistration of James Knox Polk. The In
de pen
dent Trea
sury re
-mained the basic banking system for the next seventy years. 
The Panic of 
1837
 al
so toppled Van Buren from ofﬁ
ce when he ran for 
reelection in 
1840
. General William Henry Harrison, presumably an
-other version of the military hero who had defeated Indians at the Battle 

of T
ippecanoe Creek in 
1811
; and his running mate, John Tyler of Vir
-ginia, overwhelmed the Little Magician, in a rollicking campaign of 

song
s, parades, noise, and nonsense. “Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too,” 
shouted the Whigs; “Van, Van is a  
used-
up man.” Complete with hard 
cider, coonskin hats, rolling balls, and other such paraphernalia, this 

campaign was one of the liveliest and funniest in American history. Was 

this another result of a democracy run wild? Another effect of Jackso
-nian Democracy? Had the nation abandoned rationality and statesman
-ship for bombast and mindless buffoonery? Many Whigs thought so, 

an
d feared that this development would in time destroy the Republic. 
Still they won. 
In the election, Harrison captured nineteen of the  
twe
nty-
six states 
for a total count of 
214
 electoral votes to Van Buren’s 
60. A third party 
112 
a short history of the united states 
that favored the abolition of slavery, the Liberty Party, nominated 
Ja
mes G. Birney, who garnered a little over 
7,000 pop
ular but no elec
-toral votes. 
The appearance of the Liberty Party as an instrument for ending 
slaver
y in the United States was only one expression of a general feeling 
around the country that horrible conditions existed in society and 

needed to be reformed. This zeal for  
reform—or, as Ralph Waldo Em
-erson called it, “the demon of 
refo
rm”—had infected a population in 
every section of the nation. It was not abolition alone that stirred peo
-ple to action but a wide range of causes that 
we
re expected to revitalize 
and humanize social institutions. 
Much of this enthusiasm carried forward from the Enlightenment 
in
to a new age of Romanticism. Americans of this era believed in the 
perfectability of man and the inevitability of improvement. They 

preached the need to improve the conditions in which men and women 

worked and  
lived—the need, as one reformer declared, “to raise the life 
of man by putting it in harmony with his idea of the Beautiful and the 

Just.” Emerson expressed this romantic notion when he said that “one 

day all men will be lovers; and every calamity will be dissolved in the 

universal sunshine.” 
Improve society. Reform what is wrong. Fix what is broken. This, 
insisted these Romantics, was an obligation upon all, and human be
-ings had the capacity to achieve these goals because they could “tran
-scend” experience and reason and through their intuitive powers 

discover u
niversal truths. A group of men and women in New  
England, 
including Bronson Alcott, George Ripley, Nathaniel Hawthorne, 

Orestes Brownson, Margaret Fuller, Henry Thoreau, and Emerson, 

espoused this “Transcendental” idea by proclaiming that man was not 

only good but divine. The old Puritan notion about man’s sinfulness 

was replaced by a belief in his divinity. “Pantheism is said to sink man 

and nature in God,” wrote one Transcendentalist; “Materialism to sink 

God and man in nature; and Transcendentalism to sink God and na
-ture in man.” 
Transcendentalists saw beauty in nature but ugliness in a materialis
-tic society full of greed and avarice. “I know of no country, indeed,” 

declared Alexis de Tocqueville, “where the love of money has taken 
113 
The Jacksonian Era 
stronger hold of the affections of men” than in the United States. Still, 
man had it in his power to change this because he was “endowed with 

an inﬁ
nite faculty for improvement.” This faculty emanated from an 

American belief in equality, Tocqueville insisted. Clergymen who  
were at the forefront of the Transcendentalist movement put it another way, 

a more romantic way. For example, Emerson declared, “What is man 

born for but to be a Reformer, a  
Re-
Maker of what man has made, a 
renouncer of lies, a restorer of truth and good, imitating that great Na
-ture which embosoms us all?” 
At ﬁrst these Transcendentalists met at George Ripley’s home in 
Boston to discuss their beliefs and ideas, but then a few of them 
founded a community called Brook Farm in West Roxbury, Massachu
-setts, where they could live together and put their ideas into practice. 

Th
e farm never numbered more than 
150
, but they 
were visited by 
thousands who came to hear what they had to say. This experiment in 

communal living attracted many Americans, although Brook Farm 

died out after a disastrous ﬁ
 re in 
1847
. But communitarianism itself enjoyed a remarkable spurt when any 
nu
mber of communities  
were established to create cooperative units 
whereby individuals would be provided with a more harmonious way of 

life. They 
were called “phalanxes” and  
were ﬁrst introduced by Charles 
Fourier, a French socialist. Members of these phalanxes would live to
-gether and work at tasks they enjoyed and found fulﬁ
 ll
ing. Presumably 
such an environment would result in a productive society in which all 

the members would beneﬁ
t equally. Fourier’s ideas  
were propagated in 
this country in 
1840
 by Albert Brisbane of New York, whose book 
So-cial Destiny of Man
 described the “vast and foolish waste which results 

fr
om our present social mechanism and . . . 
the colossal economics and 
proﬁts which would arise from Association and Combination in indus
-trial interests.” 
Another, and different, communal experiment was founded by Rob
-ert Owen, a successful Scot manufacturer, known for his humanitarian 

act
ivities. He founded his community in New Harmony, Indiana. 
Through collective ownership of property and cooperative labor, New 

Harmony was expected to ﬂ
ourish as a model society in which every
-one would lead a happy and productive life and poverty and crime 
114 
a short history of the united states 
would be extinguished. But within two years this experiment failed. 
Ow
en’s rather strange ideas about “free love,” among other things, gen
-erated internal discord and conﬂ
 ict
. Much more successful attempts at communal living had a religious 
basis. T
he most notable, perhaps, was the Shaker movement, founded 
by Mother Ann Lee, an En
glishwoman who came to the United States 
in 1776
 and settled in Albany, New York. She taught that God had a 
dual personality: male as exempliﬁ
ed by Christ; and female, which her 
followers believed she epitomized. She preached the evil of sexual lust 

and insisted that her followers practice celibacy, which meant that their 

society continually needed converts to survive. Her disciples  were 

known as Shakers because of the religious dance they practiced. They 

would form lines, three abreast, and race around the room in a wild 

gallop, presumably shaking sin from their bodies, and singing as loudly 

as possible. By the 
1840
s some 
6,000 Shakers resided in over two dozen 
communities that had been established from Maine to Indiana. The 

Shaker movement continued well into the twentieth century but ﬁ
 nally 
died out. 
Perhaps the most remarkable and certainly the most distinctively 
American and important religious group to appear during the Jackso
-nian era 
were th
e Mormons, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-
Day Saints, founded by Joseph Smith. He claimed he was visited 
and instructed by an angel, Moroni, to dig up and transcribe a book 

written on golden plates and buried in a stone box. The resulting Book 

of Mormon, published in 
1830
, purported to provide an account of the 
lost tribes of Israel. And the name Mormon was derived from a prophet 

who lived among the early settlers of America. Smith gathered follow
-ers to his new faith and led them from New York, where he was born, 

to O
hio, then Missouri, and ﬁ
nally Nauvoo, Illinois. At age  
thirty-
eight 
he was murdered in Carthage, Illinois, because of the hostility to his 

faith among neighbors in the surrounding towns and the fact that some 

Mormons, including Smith, practiced polygamy. Brigham Young then 

assumed leadership of the Mormon community and moved it to a desert 

region near the Great Salt Lake in Utah, where the church ﬂ
 ourished 
and steadily grew in wealth and number. Over the past 
150
 years it has 
spread around the world because of the missionary efforts of its young 

people. By the middle of the  
twenty-
ﬁrst century membership in the 
115 
The Jacksonian Era 
church is expected to exceed ﬁ
 fty million and will rank among the top 
ﬁve Christian denominations in the United States. 
The Shaker and Mormon phenomena was one expression of a re
-markable outburst of religious frenzy that swept across much of the 
coun
try in the late eigh
teenth century and the early nineteenth. This 
was the Second Great Awakening, and it is one of the most important 

reasons for the reforming zeal of the Jacksonian era. It inﬂ
 uenced al
-most every aspect of American thought and activity. It was the begin
-ning of an evangelical movement that started with a series of revival 

me
etings at the turn of the nineteenth century and reached its zenith 
in the 
1820
s and 
1830
s. Itinerant preachers who had little formal theo
-logical education but mesmerizing theatrical talents summoned wor
-shippers to repent their sins and reform their lives. Their words, their 

own de
ep commitment, and their physical involvement resulted in 
emotional orgies, with men and women tearing their hair, beating their 

breasts, rolling on the ground, begging God’s forgiveness, publicly 

confessing their sins, and promising to devote themselves to doing 

good and improving society. 
It is no surprise that many of the reforms during the Jacksonian age 
were in
itiated and advanced by religious leaders. They called on their 
followers to band together and establish organizations to improve soci
-ety and ameliorate human suffering. Charles Grandison Finney was 

th
e most prominent preacher of his day and the originator of modern 
evangelical Protestantism in America. “The evils have been exhibited,” 

preached Finney, “the call has been made for reform
. . . . 
Away with 
th
e idea that Christians can remain neutral and keep still, and yet enjoy 
the approbation and blessing of God.” So men and women like Horace 

Mann, Dorothea L. Dix, Frances Wright, Neal Dow, Lucretia Mott, 

William Ladd, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, along 

with many others, responded to these pleas and set about improving 

penal institutions and insane asylums, ending slavery, providing equal 

rights and better education for women, promoting temperance, assist
-ing the poor, advocating better working conditions, and fostering peace 

around the world. Horace Mann shared his creed with the graduating 
class of Antioch College in Ohio just a few weeks before his death. “Be 

ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity,” he 

said. 
116 
a short history of the united states 
The improvement in public education to which Mann devoted his 
li
fe also stimulated the improvement of textbooks. Virtually all the 
early manuals  
were of poor quality, and not until Noah Webster intro
-duced his 
Spell
ing Book
 and 
Reader
 did education improve substantially. 
In 1836
 William H. McGuffey’s 
Eclectic Reader
 was published and had 
an immediate and tremendous impact on elementary school instruc
-tion. The book emphasized cultural and moral standards and preached 
a pat
riotism that exactly ﬁ
tted the country’s growing sense of national
-ism. There is little doubt that McGuffey had a greater inﬂ
 uence 
on 
American life than any other writer or politician of the age. 
How did this happen? What could have brought on this strange and 
won
derful phenomenon, this Age of Reform, this Second Great Awak
-ening? As with most important events in history, there are a number of 

reaso
ns. For one, Americans  
were in the midst of a series of enormous 
changes, and the changes came with a staggering number of sudden 

jolts to the body politic. It has been argued that the United States 

changed more profoundly during the thirty years from 
1790
 to 1820 
than during any other period in its entire history. It should be remem
-bered that Americans had just concluded a Revolution in which they 

ca
st off monarchical rule and established a republican government. 
Then, in the midst of their “experiment in freedom” under the Consti
-tution, po
liti
cal parties formed to run the government. But the experi
-ment elicited contempt from Eu
ro
pean powers, and ultimately resulted 
in a war with En
gland. Only the incredible victory at New Orleans by 
General Jackson and his troops spared the United States from utter 

humiliation. 
Additional changes followed the war. The industrial revolution be
-gan and would eventually convert the nation from an agricultural to an 

indu
strial society. It was followed by a Transportation Revolution in 
which communication between sections and regions advanced the ex
-pansion of the nation. Most profoundly, the evolution from a republi
-can government to a demo 
cr
atic government brought a new and 
different generation of leaders into power. Washington, Franklin, 

Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, and Madison had been replaced by Old 

Hickory, the Little Magician, Tippecanoe, Young Hickory, and Old 

Rough and Ready. Small wonder, then, that Americans who  were 

caught up in these many changes turned to religion to ﬁ
nd stability and 
117 
The Jacksonian Era 
purpose in life and meaningful activities that could reform society and 
make it better. 
This generation of 
ro
manticists also produced a ﬂ
owering of a 
national literature. A large number of creative artists ﬂ
 ourished during 
the Jacksonian era. Nathaniel Hawthorne, for example, experienced the 
ideas of Transcendentalism while living in Concord, Massachusetts, 

and conveyed them in 
Twice- Told Tales
 and his novels 
The Scarlet Letter 
and 
The House of the Seven Gables
. Henry Thoreau, a close friend of 
Emerson’s and another prominent Transcendentalist, spent two years 

at Walden Pond before producing his masterpiece, 
Walden
, which ex
-pressed his philosophical, religious, and economic views and the joy of 

living close to nature. “I went to the woods,” he wrote, “because I 
wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and 

to see if I could learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, 

discover that I had not lived.” He refused to pay a Massachusetts tax to 

support a war and preferred to go to jail rather than allow a sovereign 

state to coerce his free will. He wrote the vastly important “Civil Dis
-obedience,” a work that had an enormous inﬂ
uence o
n Mahatma Gan
-dhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Probably the most gifted writer of this generation was Herman 
Me
lville, whose monumental novel 
Moby-Dick
 grappled with the 
problem of man’s eternal struggle with evil. He even included in this 

work a tribute to Andrew Jackson and the democracy that bore his 

name: 
If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I 

shal
l hereafter ascribe high qualities . . . 
then against all mortal 
critics bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast 

spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me 

out in it, thou great demo 
cratic God! . . .  
Thou who didst pick up 
Andrew Jackson from the pebbles, who didst hurl him upon a 

war
horse, who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou 
who, in all Thy mighty earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy 

selectest champions from the kingly commons, bear me out in it, 

O God. 
118 
a short history of the united states 
No one writer epitomized romanticism in his works more than Ed
-gar Allan Poe, who created the detective novel in such books as 
Mur
-ders in the Rue Morgue
 and 
The Purloined Letter
. His poetry, “The 
Raven,” “The Bells,” and “Annabel Lee”; his short stories, such as “The 
Gold Bug” and “The Fall of the 
House of Usher,” proved him to be a 
singularly inventive and exciting writer. Other poets of the Jacksonian 

age include Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and 

John Greenleaf Whittier. Longfellow romanticized Indians, Lowell 

satirized the Mexican War, and Whittier attacked slavery. But the out
-standing poetic genius of the antebellum era was Walt Whitman, 

whose 
Leaves of Grass
 emphasized the Transcendental themes of man’s 
goodness and the beauty of nature. His work is a landmark of Ameri
-can literature. 
Although the South did not produce literary masterpieces compa
-rable to those from the North, several southern writers produced works 

of
 more than common interest and value. William Gilmore Simms 
wrote a number of romantic novels about the old South, such as 
The Yemassee
 and 
The Partisan
. Both Augustus B. Longstreet, who wrote 
Georgia Scenes
; and Joseph Baldwin, who penned 
The Flush Times of 
Alabama and Mississippi
, sought to capture the rawness and vitality of 
backwoods life. But as Simms so graphically said, “The South don’t give 

a d—d for literature or art.” And certainly not for genuine American 

literature, which described southerners’ surroundings. 
A different kind of artist, but a major one nonetheless, John James 
Audubon
, produced magniﬁ
cent paintings in 
Birds of America
, captur
-ing the beauty and variety of these creatures and demonstrating the 

lu
sh and gorgeous background of the American forest. 
Americans also showed a preference for applied scientiﬁ
 c tec
hniques 
over pure scientiﬁ
c theory. They 
were pragmatists and sought what 
could be useful and proﬁ
table. One foreign observer commented, 
“Where in Eu
rope young men write poems or novels, in America, 
especially Massachusetts and Connecticut, they invent machines and 

tools.” Indeed. During the Jacksonian era several important machines 

and techniques  
were invented, including the mechanical reaper for 
harvesting grain, invented by Cyrus McCormick in 
1831
; the revolver, a 
weapon developed by Samuel Colt in 
1835
; the vulcanization of rubber, 
produced by Charles Goodyear in 
1839
; the telegraph, the work of the 
119 
The Jacksonian Era 
artist Samuel F. Morse in 
1844
; and the sewing machine, by Elias 
Howe in 
1846
; and many other discoveries of such lesser renown as the 
discovery of anaesthesia by William T. G. Morton, a dentist, in 
1842
. A further result of this creativity was the establishment of new busi
-nesses and new markets. Americans became experts at converting inven
-tions into marketable commodities and then selling them around the 
wor
ld. What happened was that these new Americans of the antebel
-lum era possessed characteristics that set them apart from Europeans. 
So
me of those characteristics included an intensely pragmatic outlook 
on life and a burning desire to get ahead and improve their position in 

society. 
Of the many economic, religious, and social reforms that occurred 
du
ring this Jacksonian period, none was more eventful than the in
-creasingly determined demands by northerners that slavery be abol
-ished throughout the country. After all, a free, supposedly civilized, 

Ch
ristian people holding slaves and proﬁ
ting from the institution of 
slavery seemed to many a contradiction of everything the nation es
-poused about freedom and democracy. 
There was a long tradition of opposition to slavery in the United 
St
ates, especially among religious groups such as the Quakers. But as a 
result of the reform impetus following the War of 
1812
, the demand for 
abolition intensiﬁ
ed. A striking example was the debate in Congress 
over the admission of Missouri into the 
Union: secession and even civil 
war  were threatened by southerners if their “peculiar institution” was 

jeopardized in any way. A series of compromises spared the  
Union a 
possible breakup. But they prompted Jefferson, now in retirement, to 

warn that the conﬂ
ict was “a speck on our horizon” that might well 
“burst on us like a tornado.” It was frightening, he said, like hearing “a 

ﬁ re-bell in the night.” 
Another frightening sound came in 
1822
, when Denmark Vesey, a 
free mulatto, led a small army of followers (whites exaggerated the 

number by claiming that it reached 
9,000) in preparing for a general 
revolt to win their freedom in Charleston, South Carolina. This “ser
-vile insurrection” was brutally suppressed by ﬁ
ve com
panies of the 
South Carolina militia, and some 
thirty-
ﬁve slaves  
were hanged and 
another 
thirty-
seven  
were banished from the state. But the fear of future 
insurrections lingered in the minds of southerners. They convinced 
120 
a short history of the united states 
themselves that blacks would rise up one day and indiscriminately 
mu
rder whites, just as blacks on the island of Santo Domingo in the 
Carib
bean had done a short while before. “Let this never be forgotten,” 
warned one man, “that our NEGROES . . . are the 
anarchists
 and the 
domestic enemy
; the 
common enemy of civilized society
, and the barbarians 
who would, IF THEY COULD, become the DESTROYERS 
of our 

race
.” An even worse incident occurred less than ten years later. Nat Turn-
er’
s rebellion is undoubtedly the worst slave insurrection in American 
history. It probably knocked all southerners into a permanent state of 

fear and terror with respect to their relationship to African-
Americans. 
Turner was driven by the horrors regularly visited on his race because 

of their servitude. Some say he was a religious fanatic intent on leading 

his people to freedom. In any event, on August 
22, 1831
, at a place called 
Jerusalem in southeast Virginia, he and about 
100
 slaves slaughtered 
sixty whites, including some women and children. They continued 

their murderous rampage throughout the day and virtually wiped out 

the entire white community. 
The local constabulary rushed to the scene and began a systematic 
massacre of every black they could ﬁ
 nd, guilty or not. Several of these 
bloodthirsty avengers swore that they would kill “every black person 

they saw in Southampton County.” Some slaves 
were beheaded, their 
heads hoisted on poles and publicly displayed. It is uncertain how many 

blacks 
were executed in this mad act of revenge, but the ﬁ
 gure surely 
ran to several hundred. 
The Turner Rebellion sent shock waves across the entire South. “Fear 
wa
s seen in every face,” reported one Southerner. And what made it 
worse was the growing presence of abolitionists, who demanded the out
-lawing of the institution or at least a decision by Congress to ban the 

im
portation of slaves into the territories. The founding in 
1833
 of the 
American Antislavery Society provided or
ganiza
tion
al structure to 
the movement, and the establishment of a network of stations on the 

“underground railroad” assisted runaway slaves in their ﬂ
ight to freedom. 
This abolitionist activity was augmented by a number of northern states 

that passed “personal liberty laws,” forbidding state ofﬁ
cials from assist
-ing in the capture and return of these fugitives. 
121 
The Jacksonian Era 
To make matters worse, race riots regularly occurred in a number of 
cities, including Washington. What triggered the outbreak in the cap
-ital was the attempt by an abolitionist to distribute “incendiary publica
-tions among the negroes of the district” which  
were “c
alculated to 
excite them to insurrection and the bloody course” that had resulted in 
the Turner Rebellion. The rioting in Washington went on for days and 

necessitated the calling out of armed troops to restore order and protect 

public buildings. The 
National Intelligencer
 commented, “We could not 
have believed it possible” that such violence could occur in the capital 

of a free people. 
Neither the Whig Party nor the Demo
cr
atic Party would adopt a 
platform calling for the abolition of slavery or the prohibition of its ex
-pansion into the territories. Demo
cr
ats argued that the situation of the 
black man had been decided by the Constitution in a compromise that 

called for the counting of 
three-
ﬁfths of slaves in determining each 
state’s repre
sen
tation in the lower  
house of Congress. That was the 
agreement. To change it by freeing the slaves would void the contract 

and lead to disunion. The Whigs  
were torn between those in the South 
who decried any interference in their right to hold slaves and to take 

them into the territories and those in the North who recognized the 

need to address the problem but could not agree on a single solution. 

Many of these northerners later drifted away from the party in the 
1850
s and eventually formed the Republican party. 
Petitions ﬂ
ooded into Congress demanding that some action be 
taken to limit slavery. But southerners would have none of it, and on 

May 
26, 1836,
 in the  House of Representatives the members voted to 
table (in effect, to kill) any petition that related “in any way or to any 

extent whatsoever to the subject of slavery or the abolition of slavery.” 

John Quincy Adams, now a member of the  
House, defended the “right 
of petition” and over the next several years fought to have this “gag 

resolution” rescinded. Year after year the “gag” was reimposed, until 

December 
3, 1844
, when it failed to win passage by a vote of 
108
 to 80. Northern members 
were at last responding to the increased demands 
of their constituents to protect the right of petition. “Blessed, forever 

blessed, be the name of God,” pronounced Adams on ﬁ
 nally winning 
this battle. 
122 
a short history of the united states 
The right of petition had been sustained, but the basic problem re
-mained: slavery. And the continuance of the  
Un
ion lay in the balance. 
The whigs had 
triumphed in the election of 
184
0, and with both 
houses of Congress and the ofﬁ
ce of the chief executive in their con
-trol, they expected to dismantle Jackson’s program, charter a new bank, 
an
d raise the tariff once the  
ten-
year truce ended in 
1843
. But President 
William Henry Harrison died a month after his inauguration in 
1841
. Now John Tyler succeeded him, and Tyler reverted to his old loyalty to 

the Demo
cratic Party. He not only vetoed the Whig-sponsored mea
-sures to revive the national bank and raise the tariff, but he sought the 

an
nexation of Texas, which won its in
de pen
dence from Mexico in 
1836
. This reaching out for additional territory in the west inaugurated a new 

concept in American thinking, one John L. O’Sullivan, editor of 
The Demo cratic Review
, called Manifest Destiny. His essay in the 
Review 
stated that it is “the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to 

possess the  whole of the continent which Providence has given us for 

the development of our great experiment of liberty and federated self 

government entrusted to us.” 
Years earlier, Jackson had encouraged expansion. He said it was es
-sential for American security, especially in the Southwest along the 

Gulf of Mexico. It was dangerous, he declared, “to leave a foreign 
power in possession of heads of our leading branches of the great mis
-sissippi.” Expansion was “necessary for the security of the great empo
-rium of the west, Neworleans.” Besides, he went on, “the god of the 

un
iverse had intended this great valley to one nation.” And that 
nation—obviously—was the United States. Which is why he regarded 

the presence of the British, the Spanish, and Native Americans to be a 

constant threat to the safety of the American people and why he was 

determined to get rid of them. One by one he had defeated all of them 

militarily. But that was not enough. Jackson was simply repeating what 

he had said just before the War of 
1812
: that he sought the acquisition 
by the United States of “all Spanish North America.” 
Manifest Destiny quickly captured the imagination of the Ameri
-can people and their government, and it is small wonder that when 

Tyler proposed a joint resolution of both 
houses of Congress (an earlier 
123 
The Jacksonian Era 
attempt at a treaty of annexation, which required a  
two-
thirds vote, 
was defeated in the Senate) that required only a majority vote from 
each  
house, it passed. The President signed it on March 
1, 1845
, a few 
days before he was succeeded by James Knox Polk, who had defeated 

Henry Clay in 
1844
 in a very close presidential election. Texas ratiﬁ
 ed the annexation on July 
4, 1845
, and was admitted as a slave state on 
December 
29, 1845
. But Polk, a protégé of Andrew Jackson, was not satisﬁ
ed
 with Texas. 
Like Jackson, he lusted after “all Spanish North America.” In par
tic 
u-lar he wanted California, with its incomparable seaports fronting the 

Pac
iﬁ
c Ocean and the possibility of an expanded trade with the Ori
-ent. During the presidential campaign of 
184
4, the Demo
crats not only 
demanded all of Texas to the Rio Grande but raised the cry of “
54°40' or 
Fight,” by which they meant the reoccupation of 
Oregon—that is, all 
the territory of the extreme northwest, right up to the border of Rus
-sian Alaska. The area in 
di
spute—roughly from the Rocky Mountains 
to the Paciﬁ
c Ocean and from the northern border of California to 

54°40'—was jointly occupied by Britain and the United States. Polk’s 
victory over Clay encouraged Tyler to move forward on Texas, but he 

made no move toward the Oregon country. When Polk succeeded to 

the presidency, he was more concerned about acquiring California and 

the area west of Texas than challenging Great Britain over Oregon, so 

he readily agreed to establish the 
49th parallel as the border separating 
Canada and the United States. A treaty was speedily arranged with 

Great Britain on June 
15, 1846
, and the Senate hastily ratiﬁ
 ed it. 
Mexico regarded the annexation of Texas as a clear indication of the 
United States’  
ever-
expanding lust for additional territory, and it in
-sisted that the Nueces River, not the Rio Grande, separated the two 

coun
tries. Furthermore, Mexico rejected offers by the United States to 
buy California. Whereupon Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor, 

commander of about 
3,500
 troops stationed on the Nueces River, to 
advance to the Rio Grande, a sort of 
no-
man’s-land between the United 
States and Mexico. This action virtually invited a Mexican attack, 

which not surprisingly occurred on April 
25, 1846
, when a detachment 
of Mexican troops crossed into the “no-
man’s-land,” ambushed an 
American scouting party of sixty-
three soldiers, killed sixteen of them, 
and captured the others. 
124 
a short history of the united states 
When word of this engagement reached Washington, Polk immedi
-ately prepared a war message. He told Congress that Mexico had “shed 
Am
erican blood on American soil,” and he asked the  House and Sen
-ate to “recognize the existence of war” between the two countries. A 

bil
l appropriating $
10 million and authorizing the President to call for 
50,000 volunteers prompted the protests of Whig congressmen, who 
claimed they 
were being asked to vote on providing volunteers before 

war had been declared, an act of outright aggression. To resolve the 

problem the administration’s leaders in Congress attached a preamble 

to the bill stating that war already existed by virtue of the invasion of 

Texas by Mexico. The mea
sure passed and the President signed it on 
May 
13, 1846
. The war itself provided one military victory after another for the 
United States. General Taylor defeated a superior force of Mexicans at 
Buena Vista in February 
1847
; and General Winﬁ
eld Scott led an expe-

The Jacksonian Era 
dition that landed at Vera Cruz and swept inland to Mexico City. On 
September 
14, 1847
, American troops captured the capital and Scott ac
-cepted its formal surrender by the city council. Meanwhile John C. 

Fr
émont, captain of an engineering corps, arrived on an exploring 
expedition in California and upon hearing that the United States had 

declared war against Mexico helped a band of frontiersmen proclaim 

the in
de pen
dence of California. At ﬁ
rst they set up the Bear Flag Re
-public, but then they raised the Stars and Stripes. 
At about the same time Col
on
el Stephen W. Kearny, stationed at 
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, was ordered to invade New Mexico. He 

arrived at Santa Fe in August, forced the retreat of a Mexican force 

that was more than twice the size of his own army, and proclaimed 

New Mexico a territory of the United States. He then proceeded west, 

where he joined Frémont and completed the conquest of California. 
In an effort to end the war as quickly as possible, Polk dispatched a 
cl
erk in the State Department, Nicholas Trist, to Mexico as his peace 
commissioner. Trist succeeded in producing the Treaty of Guadalupe 
Continental expansion of the United States
126 
a short history of the united states 
Hidalgo on February 
2, 1848, and the Senate ratiﬁ
ed it on March 
10 by a vote of 
38 to 14. By the treaty the United States received title to 
over 
500
,000 square miles of territory, including the present states of 
California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona; the western 
slope of Colorado; and a corner of Wyoming. Mexico also recognized 

the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas. In return, the United States 

paid Mexico $
15 million plus $
3.25 million in assumed claims by its 
citizens against Mexico. American casualties in the war came to 
1,721 from combat, and 
11,550 from disease. Both Daniel  
Webster and Henry 
Clay, who had opposed the war, lost sons in the conﬂ
 ict. Mexican ca
-sualties amounted to 
50,000. Manifest Destiny had brought the nation to a new era in its history, 
on
e that generated pride in what had been accomplished, especially the 
acquisition of a territorial empire. But the consequences of the Mexi
-can War also brought a series of crises during the next de cade that 

ended i
n secession and civil war. 
5The Dispute over Slavery,
Secess
ion, and the Civil War
Already the nation
 was reeling. On August 
8, 1846
, a young, 
impetuous, 
ruddy-
complexioned freshman member of the  
House 
of Representatives by the name of David Wilmot,  
rose in the chamber 
and proposed a Proviso to an appropriations bill. The Wilmot Proviso 
took everyone by surprise. It stated “that, as an express and fundamen
-tal condition to the acquisition of any territory from the Republic of 

Me
xico . . .  
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in 
any part of said territory.” Wilmot claimed that he did not oppose slav
-ery where it already existed, as in Texas; but free territory, such as the 

te
rritory received from Mexico, was totally different. “God forbid,” he 
declared, “that we should be the means of planting this institution 

upon it.” 
All hell broke loose in the  
Hou
se. Southerners expected to take 
their slaves into a territory they had done so much to acquire. They 

raved and ranted in the heated debates over passage of the Wilmot 

Proviso, threatening secession. The  House became one continuous riot 

of angry and frustrated men who frequently ended their outbursts with 

challenges to meet on the dueling ground. 
Southerners tried to block passage of the Proviso, but it passed in 
th
e  House by a vote of 
80 to 64. In the Senate, however, where south
-erners had greater voting strength, they killed it. Session after session 

du
ring the next several years the Proviso won passage in the  House and 
128 
a short history of the united states 
defeat in the Senate. “As if by magic,” editorialized the 
Bos
ton Whig
, the Proviso “brought to a head the great question which is about to 
divide the American people.” Still, the issue could not be left hanging 

indeﬁ
nitely, especially after the Mexican War ended and the country 
received millions of acres in the Southwest that seemed ripe for the 

introduction of the “peculiar institution.” 
With a presidential election approaching, Polk decided to step down 
af
ter one term as chief executive, and the Democrats nominated Lewis 
Cass of Michigan to replace him. Cass supported the doctrine of pop
-ular sovereignty, whereby local government, not the national govern
-ment, should decide whether or not to allow slavery within its borders. 

As h
is running mate, William O. Butler was chosen. 
Because of the growing controversy, a number of Democrats split off 
fr
om the party, nominated Martin Van Buren for President, and en
-dorsed the Wilmot Proviso. The Liberty Party, which supported aboli
-tion, joined these dissenters, and together the two groups met in 

Bu
ffalo, where they formed the Free Soil Party in support of Van Bu
-ren and Charles Francis Adams, the son of John Quincy Adams, for 

Vi
ce President. Their platform called for “free soil, free speech, free 
labor, and free men.” The Whigs decided to try another general as 

their candidate and picked Zachary Taylor to head their ticket, along 

with Millard Fillmore. 
In another extremely close election Taylor defeated Cass by winning 
163
 electoral votes to Cass’s 
127
. The pop 
ular vote was 
1,361
,000 for Taylor; 
1,222,000 for Cass; and 
291
,000 for Van Buren. The former 
President received no electoral votes, but he deprived Cass of enough 

pop
ular votes to give New York, and with it the election, to Taylor. 
Had New York or Pennsylvania voted for Cass, he would have won the 

election. 
Then, an event in California necessitated immediate congressional 
act
ion concerning the territories acquired from Mexico. Shortly after 
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, ending the war, work
-men constructing a mill for John Sutter, a Swiss immigrant, discovered 

gol
d in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in the Sacramento valley. 
Sutter tried to keep the discovery secret, but word of it quickly spread 

and a mad rush to the gold ﬁ
elds began. Thousands ﬂ
ooded into the 
region, crossing the plains by wagon, or sailing around Cape Horn at 
129 The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
the tip of South America, or ﬁ
ghting their way through the jungle of 
the Isthmus of Panama. These  
were the  
forty-
niners, northerners 
for the most part, and their numbers swelled within a year so that the 
population of California skyrocketed from 
6,000 to over 
85,000. When 
delegates met in September 
1849
 to write a constitution, they excluded 
slavery. And they demanded admission into the  
Union as a state, not as 
a territory. 
It was the intention of the new President, Zachary Taylor, to bring 
Ca
lifornia and New Mexico into the  
Union quickly and if possible 
sidestep any ﬁ
ght in Congress. But the plan was hopeless. As soon as 
Congress convened in December 
1849
, the two sections of the country, 
North and South, began accusing each other of actions that they found 

intolerable and that, if pursued, would likely shatter the  
Union. In one 
exchange, Representative Robert Toombs of Georgia, “a stormy pe
-trel . . .  
and always intolerant, dogmatic and extreme” shouted his pro
-test. “I . . .  
avow be
fore this  
House and country, and in the presence of 
the living God, that if by your legislation you seek to drive us from the 

territories of California and Mexico . . . thereby attempting to ﬁx a 

national degradation upon the States of this Confederacy, 
I am for dis
-union 
and . . .  
I will devote all I am and all I have on earth to its con
-summation.” 
Northerners sneered. They had heard it all before, many times over. 
Ho
w often can you threaten to leave the  
Union, only to ﬁ
nd an excuse 
to remain? But other southerners reiterated Toombs’s threat. Alexander 

H. 
Stephens of Georgia jumped to his feet. “I tell this  
Ho
use that every 
word uttered by my colleague meets my hearty response
. . . . 
I would 
ra
ther that the southern country should perish . . . than submit for one 
instant to degradation.” 
At one point the quarreling in the  
Ho
use became so intense that it 
resulted in a melee. Members physically attacked one another. “Had a 

bomb exploded in the hall,” reported the sergeant at arms, Nathan 

Sargent, “there could not have been greater excitement.” It seemed as 

though the nation was headed toward dissolution unless some compro
-mise could be found that would be satisfactory to both sides. 
Fortunately, the “Great Compromiser” himself sat in the Senate, 
an
d on January 
29, 1850
, Henry Clay proposed a series of resolutions 
that he believed both the North and the South would ﬁ
 nd satisfactory. 
130 
a short history of the united states 
These resolutions included the admission of California as a state with
-out reference to slavery; the establishment of territorial governments 
fo
r New Mexico and Utah based on pop 
ular sovereignty; settlement of 
the boundary of Texas and the assumption of Texas’s debt on condition 

that Texas relinquish all claim to any part of New Mexico; passage of 

a more effective fugitive slave law; agreement to the “inexpediency” of 

abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia without the approval 

of the people living there and the “expedience” of abolishing the slave 

trade within the District; and the denial of congressional authority to 

interfere in the interstate slave trade. 
During the debates Senator Daniel Webster delivered his famous 
7th of March speech, in which he said: “I wish to speak today not as a 
Massachusetts man, not as a Northern man, but as an American
. . . . I spea
k today for the preservation of the  Union.  
Hear me for my cause.” 
On the other hand, the dying John C. Calhoun (his speech had to be 

read by a colleague) blamed the North for all the nation’s problems and 

demanded the restoration of southern rights through a constitutional 

amendment. “Disunion is the only alternative that is left us,” he warned. 

Shortly thereafter, on March 
31, 1850
, he died. Clay appealed for mu
-tual concessions, which, he said,  were the only basis for compromise. 

Ea
ch side must give something and each must gain something. Neither 
can win or lose. Both must yield to the needs to the other. 
This debate is arguably the most celebrated in American history. 
Wh
en it came time to vote, the eight proposals 
were offered as a single 
package, an Omnibus Bill, and as such it went down to defeat on July 

31. A single package gave the senators no choice. It was approval for all 
eigh
t resolutions or nothing. Fortunately, after the defeat, Senator Ste
-phen A. Douglas of Illinois unraveled the Omnibus Bill and arranged 

to
 bring each one of the proposals up for a separate vote. He realized 
that the senators could not be expected to vote across the board in favor 

of the entire mea
sure. By separating them he gave each senator the op
-tion of voting for one and against another. As it turned out there was a 

maj
ority for every one of the proposals, and they passed the Senate in 
August and September 
1850
. The  
House of Representatives also ap
-proved, and the bill was signed by Millard Fillmore, who had suc
-ceeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Zachary Taylor on 

Jul
y 9. 131 
The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
The Compromise of 
1850
 ranks among the greatest and most impor
-tant legislative acts in the entire history of the United States. If nothing 
else
, it postponed secession and civil war by ten years, a period that 
made possible the salvation of the  
Union. During those ten years the 
North underwent rapid industrialization that would enable it to pum
-mel the South into submission; and the ten years also provided the 

ti
me necessary to bring about the politi
cal rise of Abraham Lincoln, 
the sole ﬁgure most responsible for saving the  
Union. 
The importa n t ch a nges 
occurring in the United States were 

au
gmented by a great new wave of immigrants. During the Jacksonian 
era the number of immigrants arriving in this country steadily in
-creased from approximately 
8,000 a year t
o 80,000. Then, between 
1840
 and 
1860
, that number climbed to 
4.2 million—six times what it 
had been over the previous twenty years. En
gland, Scotland, and Wales 
provided 
500
,000 people in the antebellum period, but far and away 
the largest number of immigrants came from Ireland. The widespread 

famine during 
1845
 and 
1846
, resulting from a disease that destroyed 
Ireland’s potato 
crop—its chief food 
supply—caused the death of 
1 million men, women, and children. Another 
2 million abandoned their 
homeland and came to America between 
1846
 and 
1860
. Although for 
the most part they 
were farmers, they did not have the money to pur
-chase land in the West, so most of them settled in the cities, especially 

Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and other port cities along the coast. 
They tended to cluster together for support and thus created the ﬁ
 rst 
American ghettos. They found employment as domestic help, factory 

workers, and construction laborers on the railroads and slowly ad
-vanced their status in society. They also turned to politics to protect 

th
eir interests, and since they spoke En
glish, they did not encounter 
the problems that other, non-
English- 
speaking immigrants faced. In 
fact it did not take long for them to assume politi
cal leadership in the 
many cities where they settled. 
Another national group to migrate to the United States at this time 
were th
e Germans. Following the revolution of 
1848
 thousands of po
-liti
cal refugees ﬂ
ed Germany. Some of them 
were intellectuals, but 
most of these immigrants  
were peasants who had more money than the 
132 
a short history of the united states 
Irish and therefore tended to move to the farming communities along 
the
 frontier or to western cities. 
There  
were ar
tisans and skilled craftsmen among these immigrants, 
and they helped advance the industrial development of this country. 

Once the United States recovered from the prolonged Panic of 
1837
, the 
rate of economic growth, especially in the manufacturing sector, 

accelerated rapidly. About 
1.3 million skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled 
workers found jobs in industry. The opening of rich coal mines in 

Pennsylvania allowed companies to switch from wood-
burning to 
coal-
burning sources of heat. This was particularly true in the iron 
manufacturing industry. Steam power, applied to steamboats and rail
-roads, also transformed transportation. The demand for railroad con
-struction intensiﬁ
ed in the 1850
s, so that by the end of the de 
cade 
30,000 miles of track had been laid in the United States, and railroads 
such as the Erie, the New York Central, the Pennsylvania, and the 

Baltimore and Ohio connected cities in the Midwest, especially Chi
-cago, to eastern cities. The  
mach
ine-
tool industry in America devel
-oped quite rapidly, and more and more products sold at home and 

abr
oad  
were the result of machine labor. 
There was some manufacturing in the South, but nothing compared 
wi
th what developed in the North. The South remained primarily an 
agricultural area, although it did have merchants, lawyers, and other 

professionals. The overwhelming number of southerners were farmers, 

raising cotton, tobacco, hemp, sugar, and rice, depending on their loca
-tion. Of the 
8 million southern whites in 
186
0, only a third owned 
slaves. The rest worked small farms themselves, with members of their 

family. Most of those who did own slaves had only a few, perhaps one 

or two. The idea of the South as a vast collection of huge plantations 

manned by hundreds of slaves, where the master lived in a large colon
-naded mansion and the slaves resided in small shacks behind the big 

ho
use, is totally false. There  
were few such plantations, although some 
did exist in each state. These plantations usually consisted of about 

1,000 acres, with ﬁ
fty slaves, and their own
ers constituted the upper 
class of society in the South. Andrew Jackson, for example, owned 
150 
slaves at one time, but that was quite extraordinary. On these particu
-larly large 
1,000-acre  
farms—Jackson always called his property “the 
farm”—the own
er would normally hire an overseer to supervise the 
133 The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
work of the slaves. Overseers 
were usually poor whites who would ad
-minister the workforce by dividing the slaves into smaller units directed 
by tr
usted and able blacks called drivers. “Mammies”  
were the domes
-tic equivalent of drivers and had charge of maintaining the big  
ho
use where the own
er and his family lived. Smaller plantations of from 
300 
to 500
 acres  
were worked by maybe ten or twelve slaves. Yet although 
most southerners owned no slaves at all, it was the slave culture that 

deﬁned life from Virginia to Texas. The “peculiar institution” of slav
-ery informed the legal, po
liti
cal, and economic framework of society 
throughout the South in the antebellum period. 
Slaves 
were consi
dered property, chattel. They could be bought and 
sold at the plea
sure of the master. Indeed, slave families could be bro
-ken up: wives separated from husbands, children taken from parents. 

In sum, t
he slave had no rights. Although it was a crime in most south
-ern states to kill a slave, still, when such a killing occurred, the perpe
-
trator invariably escaped punishment. Slaves could not go to court, or 

br
ing charges or testify against whites. They depended almost totally 
on the goodwill and decency of their own
er. Naturally, the relationship 
between slave and master varied from place to place. It was complex 

and has been described by many historians as paternalistic, with both 

master and slave having responsibilities. 
Despite this cruel and oppressive system, black men and women did 
mana
ge to carve out a space in which they could maintain a degree of 
dignity. Some even learned to read and write. Many 
were craftsmen 
who built the mansions that 
housed their own 
ers. Family and religion 
became the center of black culture. Frequently adopting Evangelical 

Protestantism as their religion, the slaves combined it with remnants of 

their west African heritage that energized, enlivened, and humanized 

their religious ser
vices. 
The harshness of slavery varied according to location and type of 
pl
antation operation. It was undoubtedly harsher in the deep South 
than along the border states of Mary
land, Kentucky, and Tennessee. 
There  
were ﬁve basic types of plantations, and they varied in size, or
-ganization, and operation. The ﬁ
rst type, the cotton plantation, em
-ployed about  two-
third
s of the slaves from North Carolina to Texas. 
Long-
ﬁ ber cotton had been grown on the southern Atlantic coast, but 
with the invention of the cotton gin in 
1793
 it was possible to proﬁ
 tably 
134 
a short history of the united states 
grow 
short-
ﬁber cotton farther west. After the War of 
1812
 the cultiva
-tion of cotton spread into Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, 
an
d Texas, so that by the 
1850
s southerners could boast that “cotton is 
king.” The second type of plantation involved the cultivation of to
-bacco. It began in eastern Mary
la
nd, Virginia, and North Carolina and 
then spread in the nineteenth century to Kentucky, Tennessee, and 

Missouri. The third type was the rice plantations, which  were located 

in the swampy coastal areas of North and South Carolina, in Georgia, 

and along the banks of the Mississippi River in southern Louisiana. 

These rice plantations required large capital investments and  were rela
-tively few. The fourth type, the sugar plantations, existed almost exclu
-sively in Louisiana. These plantations not only grew sugarcane but 

reﬁne
d it into basic sugar, thus combining manufacturing with agricul
-ture. Like the rice plantations, they required a large outlay of capital. 

Fo
r example, the smallest sugar plantation had an investment of 
$40,000. The ﬁ
fth type was the hemp plantation, which was limited to 
Kentucky and parts of Missouri. It was the smallest operation that re
-quired slaves and therefore the smallest in number. 
Make no mistake, slavery was the most basic and most ﬁ
 nan
cially 
rewarding economic operation in the United States prior to the Civil 

War. And although it was proﬁ
 table for individuals, it did not encour
-age the creation of the infrastructure of an industrial economy as was 

happ
ening in the North. But since individual southerners 
were proﬁ
 t-ing from the slave system, they were not about to see it abolished, even 

if p
erpetuating it meant dissolving the  Union. 
As slavery continued 
to
 expand westward with the acquisition 
of Texas, the demand for its abolition also intensiﬁ
ed. Indeed, at one 
time there had even been antislavery societies in the South, and many 

of these supported the American Colonization Society, which suc
-ceeded in founding a colony of free blacks in Liberia in the 
1820
s. But 
with the religious fervor of the Second Great Awakening, the aboli
-tionists of the Jacksonian age breathed a hatred for the peculiar institu
-tion that was far more intense than anything earlier. Many of them 

were ev
angelists who could recognize sin from great distances, and to 
them, slavery was sin writ large. One zealot, William Lloyd Garrison, 
135 The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
published a newspaper called 
The Liberator
 in which he even denounced 
the Constitution of the United States. It was, he wrote, “a covenant 
with death and an agreement with hell.” 
In 1852
, Harriet Beecher Stowe published a novel, 
Uncle Tom’s Cabin
, graphically depicting the cruelties of the slave system. It begged “the 

Christian and humane people of the North” to block the implementa
-tion of the Fugitive Slave Act, which had been passed as part of the 

Com
promise of 
1850
 and authorized federal marshals to return run
-away slaves to their masters. Stowe’s book sold widely and had a tre
-mendous impact on the thinking of Americans about the institution of 

slaver
y. Some, like Abraham Lincoln, declared that it helped start the 
Civil War. 
Runaway slaves had always been a problem for southerners, espe
-cially when the Underground Railroad system was set up. This con
-sisted of “stations” (usually private homes or barns) along which 

“co
nductors” could help slaves escape to freedom. Harriet Tubman, a 
runaway herself, escorted several hundred slaves to safety. It was esti
-mated that by the 
185
0s the Underground Railroad helped 
1,000 or more runaways a year escape their servitude. 
The c omprom ise of 1850
 br
ought about a period of relative politi
-cal calm, but it did not last long. It was shattered in December 
185
3, when a bill was introduced to organize the territory of Nebraska with
-out mentioning slavery, since Nebraska was north of 
36°30' as e
stab
-lished by the Missouri Compromise. A great deal of politicking took 
pl
ace in the passage of the mea
sure, and because many of the leading 
ﬁgures in the discussion favored pop 
ular sovereignty for the region, it 
was ﬁ
nally decided to split the territory in two and establish Nebraska 
to the north and Kansas to the south. In addition, the Missouri Com
-promise was declared “inoperative.” Another reason for organiz
in
g this 
territory was the desire of northern congressmen to facilitate the build
-ing of a railroad through the northern tier of states and territories that 

woul
d eventually reach the Paciﬁ
c Ocean. Building a railroad across 
organized territory with a governmental apparatus in place was far bet
-ter than building one across unor
ga
nized territory. More particularly, a 
number of congressmen had invested heavily in real estate in the 
136 
a short history of the united states 
surrounding states and  
were an
xious to protect their investment. In ad
-dition, the bill extinguished Indian titles to the land, which also helped 
wi
n approval for the entire measure. 
But the  
Kansas-
Nebraska Bill set off a titanic battle in Congress. 
Still, after the screaming and ﬁ
ghting ended in late May 
1854
, it became 
law through the healthy application of the “whip & spur” by the party 

leadership, especially by Stephen A. Douglas in the Senate and Alexan
-der H. Stephens in the  
Ho
use. Douglas claimed full responsibility. “I 
passed the  
Kansas-
Nebraska Act,” he later bragged. “I had the authority 
and power of a dictator throughout the  
whole controversy in both 
houses. The speeches  were nothing. It was the marshaling and directing 

of men, and guarding from attacks, and with a ceaseless vigilance pre
-venting surprise.” But Stephens helped. “If I had not been  here the Bill 

woul
d never have been got through. I took the reins in my hand and 
drove with whip & spur until we got the ‘wagon out of the mud.’ ” 
To make the mea
sure m
ore acceptable to southerners, it speciﬁ
 cally 
repealed the Missouri Compromise and established two territories: 

Kansas to the west of slaveholding Missouri, and Nebraska to the west 

of the free states Minnesota and Iowa. The many southerners who 

voted for it clearly intended that Kansas would become slave (they 

would see to that) and Nebraska free. But the legislation was a fatal 

mistake. It annihilated the peace brought by the Compromise of 
1850 
and sent the country spinning toward disunion. 
It also refashioned the party system. For one thing, sectional loyalty 
had repl
aced party loyalty. With the slow decline of the Whig Party, 
southerners 
were steadily drifting into the Demo
cratic Party. North
-erners too. Furthermore, on February 
24, 185
4, a number of 
Free-
Soilers, 
northern Whigs, and antislavery Democrats met in Ripon, Wisconsin, 

and recommended the formation of a new party, which they called the 

Republican Party. Months later, after passage of the Kansas-
Nebraska 
Act, a meeting was held in Jackson, Michigan, on July 
6 that formally 

adopted the new name and demanded the repeal of the  Kansas-
Nebraska 
Act along with that of the Fugitive Slave Act. 
Another party to appear in the middle of the 
185
0s was the 
Know-
Nothing or American Party. It developed as a result of the large 
number of Irish and German immigrants who entered the country. By 
137 
The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
1860
 there 
were about 
4 million immigrants, and 
native-
born Americans 
suddenly became conscious, and resentful, of this large number of for
-eigners in their midst. In addition, many of these aliens  were Roman 
Ca
tholic. So the new party evolved into an anti-
immigrant, 
anti-
Catholic, and antislavery party whose members responded with “I 

know nothing” when asked about the purposes and policies of their or
-ganization. 
Thus, in the election of 
185
4, according to Senator Douglas, the 
anti-
Nebraska movement became “a crucible” into which  Know- 
Nothings “poured Abolitionism . . .  
and what was left of Northern 
Whiggism, and then the Protestant feeling against the Catholic, and 

the native feeling against the foreigner.” And they won a great many 

seats in Congress, as did the newly or
ganized Republican Party. Of the 
forty-
three northern Demo
crats who voted for the  
Kansas-
Nebraska 
Act, only seven won reelection. So successful  
were the  
Know-
Nothings 
that some predicted they would win the presidency in 
1856
. “How can 
anyone who abhors the suppression of negroes be in favor of degrading 

classes of white people?” remarked Abraham Lincoln. “As a nation, we 

began by declaring that ‘
all men are created equal.
’ . . . When the Know 
Nothings get control, it will read, ‘All men are created equal’ except 

negroes, 
and foreigners, and catholics
.” But the  
Know-
Nothing Party was 
short-
lived. Internal divisions over slavery and the  
Kansas-
Nebraska 
Act led to its demise by 
1860
. Meanwhile in Kansas, violence erupted between free men and slave
-holders that degenerated into a local civil war known as Bleeding Kan
-sas. An investigation of the situation in that territory reported that in 

its present condition Kansas could not conduct a free election without a 
new census, impartial judges, and the presence of U.S. troops at every 

polling station. And the bloodshed in Kansas was reﬂ
ected in Con
-gress when, on May 
19, 1856
, Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts 
gave a speech in the upper  house titled “The Crime against Kansas,” in 

which he accused “hirelings picked from the drunken spew and vomit 

of an uneasy civilization” of invading Kansas in an attempt to impose a 

proslavery legislature upon the citizens by force and violence. He sin
-gled out the se
ni
or senator from South Carolina, Andrew Pickens 
Butler, as the personiﬁ
cation of that “uneasy civilization” and verbally 
138 
a short history of the united states 
assaulted him in a personal attack that was one of the most abusive 
speec
hes ever delivered in Congress. 
Retaliation came swiftly. On May 
22, 1856
, Representative Preston 
S. Brooks, a nephew of Senator Butler, strode into the nearly empty 

Se
nate chamber, where he found Sumner sitting at his desk franking 
copies of his “Crime Against Kansas” speech. “Mr. Sumner,” barked 

Brooks in a threatening voice, “I have read your speech twice over care
-fully. It is a libel on South Carolina and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of 

mi
ne.” And with that, he raised a large, heavy  
gutta-
percha cane and 
struck Sumner repeatedly over the head. The badly mauled senator 

tried to escape. He was sitting close to his desk, so he tried to push 

back his chair, but the desk was ﬁ
rmly screwed to the ﬂ
oor and the rug 
underneath made it impossible to move the chair. So Sumner simply 

rose with a mighty heave, using all his strength, and in the pro 
cess 
ripped the desk from its moorings as he toppled to the ﬂ
 oor. “Bully” 
Brooks, as he came to be called, continued raining blows about Sum-

ner’s head and shoulders until the cane broke in two. “Every lick went 

where I intended,” Brooks later boasted. “I wore my cane out com
-pletely but saved the Head which is gold.” 
Brooks resigned from the  
House, but his constituents reelected him 
overwhelmingly. To them he was a hero. Five months later he died of a 

liver disease at the age of 
thirty-
seven. Sumner survived the attack and 
after his recovery had this to say about Brooks: “Poor fellow, he was the 

unconscious agent of a malign power.” 
During this period 
of c
risis, when the nation desperately needed 
a strong, wise leader at the head of the government, one of the worst 
Presidents in the nation’s history was elected. James Buchanan, the 

Demo
cratic candidate, won election in 
1856
 over the Republican, John 
C. Frémont, and the  
Kno
w-
Nothing candidate, Millard Fillmore. 
Buchanan received 
174
 electoral votes to Frémont’s 
114
 and Fillmore’s 
8. It was a remarkable showing for the young Republican Party, and had 

Pennsylvania and either Illinois or Indiana voted for him, Frémont 

would have been elected. 
Straight off, Buchanan demonstrated his stupidity in his inaugural 
addre
ss, by announcing that the Supreme Court was about to hand 
139 
The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
down a decision which would settle the problem of slavery. The ques
-tion immediately arose as to how he knew beforehand what the court 
woul
d decide. In point of fact he was not mistaken, but he foolishly 
thought that his announcement of it would calm fears and quiet strife. 

Two days later Chief Justice Roger B. Taney delivered the Dred Scott 

decision, which declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional 

because the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution stated that no one 

could be deprived of their property without due pro cess of law. Taney 

also denied that Dred Scott, a slave suing for his freedom by virtue of 

his residence in a free state and free territory, was a citizen. As a slave, 

Scott was not entitled to sue in a federal court. The decision solved 

nothing, as Buchanan had predicted in his inaugural, and the reputa
-tion of the court plunged to its lowest level in its history. 
Meanwhile, a rigged convention held in Lecompton, Kansas, wrote 
a constitution that protected slavery and prevented the electorate from 
outlawing the institution. Voters  
were given the choice of approving 
slavery or forbidding its 
further
 introduction into the territory. Either 
way Kansas would become a slave state. 
Despite this obvious ploy to prevent a fair vote on the Lecompton 
const
itution, President Buchanan asked Congress to admit Kansas as a 
state under that constitution. And this action set off a brouhaha in 

both 
houses of Congress. In the  
House it was a wild 
free-
for-
all with 
ﬁfty or more members wrestling and punching one another. This out
-burst was the largest such melee in the entire history of that body. 

Durin
g the fracas, John F. “Bowie-
Knife” Potter of Wisconsin reached 
for the hair of William Barksdale of Mississippi and tore off his tou
-pee. “I’ve scalped him,” cried the startled Potter, and everyone burst 

int
o laughter. 
A compromise bill was ﬁ
nal
ly reached by which voters in Kansas 
could accept or reject the Lecompton constitution. On August 
2, 1858
, the electorate defeated the constitution. Kansas remained a territory 

until after the secession of southerners in 
1860
–1861
. It was admitted as 
a free state on January 
29, 1861
. In 1857 southerners  
were fu
rther outraged by the publication of 
a book by Hinton R. Helper, 
The Impending Crisis of the South, and 
140 
a short history of the united states 
How to Meet It
. He a
rgued from statistics that many southern whites 
were impoverished by slavery and that the institution was detrimental 
to their economic welfare. What increased southern anger was the fact 

that Helper was a southerner himself, from North  
Carolina. But the 
book itself provided the kind of ammunition that abolitionists used to 

attack slavery in both the northern and the southern sections of the 

country. 
The  
Lincoln-
Douglas debates in the summer of 
1858
 also infuriated 
southerners in that Lincoln asked Douglas to reconcile the doctrine of 

pop
ular sovereignty with the Dred Scott decision. Douglas replied that 
slavery could not “exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it was sup
-
ported by local police regulations.” Since he was the leading candidate 

of t
he Demo
cratic Party for the presidency in 
1860
, that remark lost 
him the South at the nominating convention. Southerners said they 

could not support a candidate who held this view. However, the de
-bates did elevate Lincoln to national attention. 
Then in 
mid-
October 
1859
, at Harpers Ferry, John Brown led a raid 
that he hoped would ignite a slave insurrection. He seized the federal 

arsenal there, and after two days of ﬁ
 ghting he was captured, tried for 
treason against the state of Virginia, and hanged on December 
2. Brown became a martyr to northern abolitionists but a frightening 

ﬁgure of madness run amok to southerners. Throughout the South 
there was a feeling that this kind of horror would be repeated because 

of the propaganda of abolitionists and the political diatribes of Repub
-licans. 
In Congress the madness surfaced in the ﬁ
 stﬁghts that broke out on 
the ﬂ
oor and the bitter words of recrimination that the members con
-tinually hurled at one another. “We will never submit to the inaugura
-tion of a Black Republican as President,” stormed a Demo
cra
t from 
Georgia. “I speak the sentiment of every Demo
crat on this ﬂ
 oor from 
the State of Georgia.” And this remark was repeated when the Demo
-crats held their nominating convention in Charleston on April 
23. No
rthern delegates 
were unwilling to satisfy the demand of the South 
that slavery be allowed in the territories, whereupon members from the 

eight southern states walked out of the convention. The party split, and 

northern Demo
crats held their convention in Baltimore on June 
18 and 
nominated Douglas and Herschel V. Johnson of Georgia for President 
141 The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
and Vice President. Southern Demo
crats also held their convention in 
Baltimore, on June 
28, and nominated John Breckinridge of Kentucky 
and Joseph Lane of Oregon. 
The Republicans met in Chicago on May 
16. Se
nator William H. 
Seward had been the leading candidate for the presidency until he gave 
a speech in Rochester, New York, on October 
25, 1858
, in which he 
said: “It is an irrepressible conﬂ
ict between opposing and enduring 
forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or 

later, become either entirely a slaveholding nation or entirely a 
free-
labor 
nation.” That “irrepressible conﬂ
ict” speech frightened a great many 
Republicans, and he lost their support. Lincoln, on the other hand, 

gave a more conciliatory but carefully worded speech at Cooper  
Union 
in New York City, known as the “House Divided” speech, in which he 

avoided any suggestion of conﬂict but did appeal for sectional under
-standing. On the third ballot the Republican convention named Lin
-coln for President and Hannibal Hamlin for Vice President. Remnants 

of the Whig and  
Know-
Nothing parties formed the Constitutional 
Union Party in Baltimore and chose John Bell of Tennessee and Ed
-ward Everett of Massachusetts as their nominees. 
Crippled by the split in its ranks, the Demo
cr
atic Party went down 
to defeat. Lincoln won eigh
teen free states for 
180
 electoral votes, a 
clear majority. Breckinridge carried eleven slave states for a total of 
72 electoral votes. Bell captured three border states for  
39 votes. Douglas 
won only one state (Missouri) and scattered votes from a second (New 

Jersey) for a total of 
12 electoral votes. In the pop ular contest Lincoln 
garnered 
1,865
,593 votes; Douglas 
1,382
,713
; Breckinridge 
848
,356
; and 
Bell 
592
,906. Many southerners had sworn that they would never remain in a 
Un
ion with a “Black Republican” President. So as soon as the results of 
this election became known nationally, the South Carolina legislature 

summoned a state convention to consider a course of action. The con
-vention met on December 
20, 186
0, and formally dissolved South Car-
olina’s ties to the other states “comprising the United States of America.” 

This action was soon followed in the rest of the lower South: Missis
-sippi seceded on January 
9, 186
1; Florida on January 
10; Alabama on Janu
-ary 
11; Georgia on January 
19; Louisiana on January 
26; and Texas on 
February 
1. These states held a convention in Montgomery,  
Alabama, 
142 
a short history of the united states 
on February 
8, an
d their representatives adopted a constitution closely 
resembling the U.S. Constitution. The document established the Con
-federate States of America and recognized the in
de pen
dence and sov
-ereignty of each state. Naturally, it protected the “peculiar institution.” 
Th
e following day the members elected Jefferson Davis as provisional 
President of the Confederacy, and Alexander H. Stephens as Vice 

President. 
There  
were at
tempts to forestall this horrendous break. A peace 
convention made up of members from northern, southern, and border 

states met behind closed doors in Washington on February 
4, 1861
, with John Tyler, the former chief executive, presiding. But the partici
-pants failed to ﬁ
nd
 an agreement acceptable to both sides. On February 
28, another effort failed to turn back secession when Congress consid
-ered a joint resolution to amend the Constitution and guarantee slavery 

in
 the states where it already existed. But some 
sixty-
ﬁ ve Republicans, 
led by Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, opposed it. Still the amend
-ment passed the  
Ho
use (133 to 65) and the Senate (
24 to 12), but the 
states did not ratify it. 
In his inaugural address on March 
4, 186
1, President Lincoln tried to 
reassure southerners that their rights, especially their right to hold 

slaves, would be protected: “I have no purpose directly or indirectly to 

interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists.” 

And he endorsed President Jackson’s claim that the  
Union was indivis
-ible, that no state had the right to separate itself from the others. 

“P
hysically speaking,” he declared, “we cannot separate.” No state, act
-ing on its own, “can lawfully get out of the  
Un
ion.” Like Jackson, he 
also reminded citizens that he was under oath to enforce the laws, and 

that duty required him to maintain federal property throughout the 

United States. His decision to provision Fort Sumter in the Charleston 

harbor, therefore, prompted the Confederates, under the command of 

General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, to attack the fort, which surrendered 

on April 
12 after more than a day of constant bombardment. And by 
this military action, the Civil War began. 
Once the ﬁ
gh
ting started, Lincoln summoned 
75,000 volunteers to 
defend the  
Union, and he called Congress into special session to begin 
on July 
4. As commander in chief he felt he had the authority to 
expand 
143 
The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
the military, authorize the purchase of armaments, and suspend the 
writ of habeas corpus wherever necessary. He also directed the states to 

increase the size of their militias so they could best serve the interests 

of the nation. When Congress convened, he told the members that he 

had done nothing they could not legislatively approve. By the summer 

of 1861
 the  
Union had 
186
,000 men under arms. Jefferson Davis also 
summoned southerners to defend their homeland and within a few 

months some 
112,000 recruits responded to his call. 
Once armed conﬂ
ict erupted, the upper South seceded: Virginia on 
April 
17, Arkansas on May 
6, Tennessee on May 
7, and North Carolina 
on May 
20. Four other slave  
states—Delaware, Mary
land, Kentucky, 
and  
Missouri—remained loyal to the  
Union, despite strong sentiment 
for the Confederacy in certain sections of these states. On the other 

hand, the western half of Virginia remained loyal to the United States, 

and seceded from the state and was admitted into the  Union as West 

Virginia on June 
19, 1863
. When Virginia seceded, the capital of the Confederacy was moved 
fr
om Atlanta to Richmond, and in no time rebel troops appeared 
across the Potomac within sight of Washington. Hurriedly, troops 

were rushed to the  
Union capital and  
were housed in the halls and 
chambers of the 
House and Senate. Once Congress met for its special 
session on July 
4, the soldiers 
were bivouacked in other parts of the 
city. 
Under the strong leadership of Thaddeus Stevens, chairman of the 
Wa
ys and Means Committee, the  
House within ﬁ
ve days approved 
legislation that permitted the secretary of the trea
sury to borrow $
250 million over the next twelve months. By the time Congress adjourned 

on August 
6 it had passed 
sixty-
six bills, all but four of which dealt 
with the war. In a little over a month it set a record for productivity, 

mainly because of vigorous leadership and a determination by a major
-ity of its members to cope with a crisis of staggering proportions. This 

recor
d of achievement continued for the next several years. 
In the belief that the Confederate capital at Richmond could be 
ca
ptured with a sudden and unexpected blow, pressure from politicians 
and the press prompted Lincoln to overrule Winﬁ
eld Scott, the com
-manding general, who argued that the troops in Washington needed 
144 
a short history of the united states 
additional training before going into battle. Accordingly, Lincoln or
-dered General Irwin McDowell, with a force of 
30,000 tr
oops, to ad
-vance and attack Confederate forces under General Beauregard at a 
pl
ace called Manassas Junction, a little town on Bull Run, or creek, 
about  
thirty-
ﬁve miles southwest of Washington. On July 
21 the two 
forces met, and at ﬁ
rst the battle went well for the  
Union. But Confed
-erate reinforcements, under General Joseph E. Johnston, arrived from 

th
e Shenandoah Valley and routed the  
Union forces, who panicked and 
ﬂed back to Washington. During the engagement General Thomas 
J. Jackson earned the nickname “Stonewall” because of his heroic stand 
du
ring the battle. Lincoln now realized the wisdom of General Scott’s 
insistence on further training for the  Union troops. McDowell was re
-placed by General George B. McClellan, who had won several skir
-mishes in western Virginia and who became general in chief upon the 

reti
rement of General Scott. 
A crisis with Great Britain was narrowly avoided when an American 
wa
rship stopped the British steamer 
Trent
 and removed James M. 
Mason and John Slidell, two Confederate commissioners bound for 

England. Secretary of State Seward ordered the men released, thus 
preventing the crisis. He declared that the American warship acted 

improperly in not bringing the 
Trent
 and the two commissioners to 
port for adjudication by an admiralty court. 
The  
Union suffered another military defeat on October 
21, at Ball’s 
Bluff near Washington, which stiffened demands by the more radical 

Republicans for an increased prosecution of the war and the abolition 

of slavery. Led by senators Benjamin Wade of Ohio and Zachariah 

Chandler of Michigan, and Representative Thaddeus Stevens, they 

called for the creation of a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the 

War, presumably as a response to Lincoln’s assumption of authority in 

conducting it. The joint committee was approved on December 
9, 1861
, immediately after Congress convened for its regular session. It was 

given broad investigatory powers to summon persons to testify and 

demand papers to document the progress of the war. The committee 

included three  
senators—Chandler; Wade; and Andrew Johnson, a 
Demo
cratic 
Unionist from 
Tennessee—and four representatives: 
George W. Julian of Indiana, Daniel W. Gooch of Massachusetts, 

John Covode of Pennsylvania, and Moses Odell, a Demo
crat from 
145 
The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
New York. Wade chaired the committee, which was dominated by 
Radical Republicans. None of these men knew much about conduct
-ing the war, but all shared distrust, if not disdain, for the military. 

Th
ey sought any opportunity to embarrass or humiliate  
top-
ranking 
generals. 
And they abused their authority. They investigated the War De
-partment for allegations of fraud and incompetence, and delved into 

th
e problem of government security, including rumors that the Presi-
dent’s wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, was a Confederate spy. Worse, they 

harassed the President about his reluctance to proceed with immediate 

emancipation of the slaves and his failure to ﬁ
 nd the necessary person 
or persons to bring the conﬂ
ict to a speedy and successful conclusion. 
The committee was, said one, “a mischievous or
ganization, which as
-sumed dictatorial powers.” It summoned generals to testify and then 

as
ked them inane questions, such as, “What do you know about war?” 
A number of obsequious and incompetent generals “scolded and carped 

and criticized, and caviled, told half truths and solid lies, and the Au
-gust and astute Committee listened with open ears.” Such testimony 

wa
s just the sort of thing the members wanted to 
hear—anything that 
belittled the military. In the course of its benighted history, it issued 

eight volumes of reports on a succession of military defeats. It also pro
-vided documentation that severely damaged the reputations of a num
-ber of unfavored generals, particularly General McClellan, whom the 

me
mbers loathed for failing to move his army and provide victories in 
the ﬁ
 eld. 
The committee met with Lincoln and his cabinet on January 
6, 186
2, and, with malicious intent, reported that “neither the President nor his 

advisers seemed to have any deﬁ
nite information respecting the man
-agement of the war, or the failure of our forces to make any forward 

movemen
t.” 
Since the cost of the war quickly mounted to $
2 million a day, Con
-gress passed a bill on February 
6, 186
2, authorizing the issuance of 
“greenbacks” or paper money as legal tender. It was the ﬁ
rst paper cur
-rency ever issued by the national government. Two months later, on 

Apr
il 
16, Congress outlawed slavery in the District of Columbia, with 
compensation to those who would free their slaves, thereby initiating 

the ﬁ
rst step in legislating the end of slavery. Republicans shouted their 
146 
a short history of the united states 
approval when the bill passed. “A few of the radical members,” sneered 
on
e critic, “indulged in excessive and quite undigniﬁ
 ed manifestations 
of this delight, hurrahing in the corridors [of Congress], and seizing 

every negro they met and overwhelming them with congratulations.” 

Lincoln regarded the action as a ploy to force him to take a stand on 

the issue. Despite his reluctance, he signed the bill, and it became law. 

Later Congress also abolished slavery in the territories, without com
-pensation. 
Of enormous importance to the steady expansion of the population 
in
 the west, Congress passed the Homestead Act on May 
20, 1862, 
which provided 
160
 acres of public land to any person who would reside 
on it and farm it for ﬁ
ve years. Within two years some 
25,000 settlers 
staked claims to over 
3 million acres of land. Similarly, the Morrill 
Land Grant College Act, passed on June 
17, 1862
, provided 
30,000 acres of land to each member of Congress to ﬁ
nance the establishment 
of public agricultural and mechanical institutions within the states and 

territories. 
One of the most important actions taken by Congress was the pas
-sage of the Internal Revenue Act of 
1862, which taxed a wide range of 
items, few of which survived the war. But the Bureau of Internal Rev
-enue created by this mea
sure d
id become a permanent ﬁxture of the 
federal government. And passage of the Paciﬁ
 c Railroad Act provided 
land and funds for the building of what would become a transcontinen
-tal railroad from Omaha, Nebraska, to Sacramento, California. 
Although the government 
ach
ieved a number of legislative 
successes, there was nothing but defeat on the military front. General 
McClellan, who was relieved of supreme command, except for the 

Army of the Potomac, was ordered to begin an advance on Richmond, 

and he took a route along the peninsula between the James and York 

rivers rather than lead a frontal attack from Washington that would 

relieve the pressure on the nation’s capital. This peninsula campaign 

came to an abrupt end in the early summer of 
1862
, with the Seven 
Days battle, in which nearly 
20,000 men on both sides  
were killed or 
wounded. Major General Henry W. Halleck was put in command of 

the  Union army. And a signiﬁ
cant battle occurred on March 
8, 1862
, 147 
The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
when two ironclads, the 
Merrimac
 and the 
Monitor
—their hulls  
were shielded in 
metal—engaged in a  
ﬁ ve-hour battle on the James River 
that resulted in a draw. The age of wooden ﬁ
ghting ships effectively 
ended on that day. 
A naval squadron under David G. Farragut ran the Confederate 
defense
s below New Orleans in April 
1862
 and bombarded the city, 
whereupon it was occupied by  
Union troops under General Benjamin 
F. 
Butler. For his success, Farragut was named a rear admiral, the ﬁ
 rst 
to be accorded that rank. 
At the Second Battle of Bull Run in late August, the  
Un
ion army 
suffered another humiliating rout by a Confederate army now com
-manded by General Robert E. Lee, who succeeded General Johnston 
af
ter Johnston was severely wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines in 
late May. Lee then invaded the North in an attempt to isolate Wash
-ington by cutting the major rail lines leading to the city. At Antietam 

th
e  Union and Confederate armies met in another bloody engagement. 
Over 
3,000 on both sides 
were killed and another 
18,000 wounded. 
The battle ended in a draw when McClellan failed to deploy his re
-serves, but Lee withdrew to Virginia and so the  
Un
ion could claim a 
“technical” victory. 
It was enough of a victory for President Lincoln to issue his Prelimi
-nary Emancipation Proclamation on September 
22. A
lthough at the 
beginning of the war he insisted that the conﬂ
ict involved preserving 
the  
Union, by this time slavery had become the deﬁ
 ning issue. In this 
Preliminary Proclamation, Lincoln declared that on January 
1, 1863
, he 
would free all the slaves in Confederate areas still in rebellion against 

the United States. “I wish it 
were a better time,” he told his cabinet. “I 

wish that we 
were in a better condition. The action of the army against 
the rebels has not been quite what I should have best liked.” Even so, it 

was time to bring the question of slavery to an end. 
The “technical” victory at Antietam also halted any possibility of 
recognition of the Confederacy by Great Britain and France. Those 
two countries had been on the verge of recognition, but now they held 

back, and this danger to the  
Union cause passed without further difﬁ
 -culty. However, Great Britain continued building raiding ships for the 

Co
nfederates, allowing the 
Alabama
 to slip out of Liverpool and inﬂ
 ict 
heavy damage on American shipping. Not until the U.S. minister to 
148 
a short history of the united states 
England, Charles Francis Adams, pointed out to the British ministry 
in April 
1863
 that it was engaged in an act of war against the United 
States did the government halt the further building of these raiding 
ships. 
And early in 
186
3, the emperor of France, Napoleon III, proposed 
mediation of the conﬂ
ict, which Congress and Secretary of State 
Seward rejected out of hand. Over protests from the United States, 

Napoleon intruded in Mexican affairs, occupied Mexico City with a 

French army, and installed Archduke Maximilian of Austria on the 

Mexican throne. Not until the Civil War ended did Napoleon heed the 

protests of Secretary Seward and withdraw his troops from Mexico. 

Maximilian was subsequently executed by Mexican partisans under 

Benito Juarez. 
Two days after issuing the Preliminary Proclamation, the President 
announced that at his discretion the writ of habeas corpus could be 
suspended anywhere in the United States. That was quite a leap of ex
-ecutive authority and really required the approval of Congress. But this 

wa
s war, and the President felt that there could and probably would be 
circumstances in which he must exercise extraordinary power to safe
-guard the liberty of the American people. Congress obliged in March 

186
3 by passing the Habeas Corpus Act, which allowed the President 
to suspend the writ for the duration of the war. 
Demo
crats, led by Clement Vallandigham, denounced this “impe
-rial military despotism.” Called “Copperheads” by their opponents be
-cause they wore “copper penny” badges to signify their willingness to 

pur
sue a conciliatory policy toward the South, these Peace Democrats 
engaged in antiadministration activities that only succeeded in dis
-crediting their cause because they adversely affected the war effort. 

Wh
en the Confederates inﬂ
icted one of the worst military defeats of 
the war on 
Union forces, now commanded by General Ambrose Burn-

side, at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on December 
13, 1862
, Copperheads 
were horriﬁ
ed by the carnage and demanded to know when the butch
-ery would end. Over 
10,000 Un
ion soldiers 
were killed or wounded in 
this engagement. Lincoln replaced Burnside with General Joseph 

Hooker. 
To assist the military operation, Congress passed both a bill for the 
recr
uitment of 
150
,000 black soldiers in early January 
1863
 and the 
149 
The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
Conscription Act on March 
3, by which all men between the ages of 
twenty and  
forty-
ﬁ ve were subject to a draft. However, it exempted 
those who paid a commutation fee of $
300
 or hired a substitute to en
-list for three years. Opposition to this law exploded in the draft riots in 
New
 York City in 
mid-
July 
1863
, violence that actually masked a race 
riot. 
The Confederates also resorted to a draft. On April 
16, 186
2, they 
passed a Conscription Act that applied to all white men between the 

ages of twenty and 
thirty-
ﬁve. Certain occupations  
were exempted, 
and substitutes 
were permitted. But the manpower problem in the 
South became more acute as the war continued year after year. 
Although Confederate forces won a stunning victory over a  
Un
ion army that was twice their size at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 

1863
, the war began to shift toward an ultimate  
Union victory. At 
Chancellorsville, Lee lost over 
10,000 troops killed and wounded. This 
loss, which he could ill afford, included “Stonewall” Jackson, who was 

shot by his own men on May 
2. General Ulysses S. Grant captured Vicksburg, Mississippi, in July, 
th
ereby slicing the Confederacy in two and bringing the entire Missis
-sippi River region under  
Un
ion control. Lee’s second attempt at invad
-ing the North was turned back at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by 

nu
merically superior 
Union troops under the command of Major Gen
-eral George G. Meade. However, Meade allowed Lee to escape into 

Vi
rginia without attacking him. Some 
50,000 men  
were killed or 
wounded at Gettysburg, and on November 
17, 1863
, the cemetery at the 
battleﬁ
eld was dedicated, in a ceremony in which the main speaker was 
Edward Everett. But it was the brief comments by Abraham Lincoln 

that are still remembered. We cannot dedicate or consecrate or hallow 

this ground, he said. The brave men, living and dead, did that far bet
-ter than we can ever attempt. Rather it is for us to be “dedicated to the 

gr
eat task remaining before us,” that we  here resolve that “these dead 
shall not have died in 
vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a 

new birth of 
freedom—and that government of the people, by the 
people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” 
A new birth of freedom! That is precisely what the war produced, 
an
d Lincoln found the noble language to convey that miraculous vi
-sion. 
150 
a short history of the united states 
With these victories and those at Lookout Mountain and Mission
-ary Ridge around Chattanooga, which routed the Confederates in 
lat
e November 
1863
, thereby opening a route through Georgia to the 
sea, Lincoln issued a Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction 

on December 
8, 1863,
 that declared that when ten percent of those 
persons in the seceded states who voted in the presidential election of 

1860
 swore an oath of loyalty to the United States, they might then 
form a government without slavery, which he would recognize, and 

reestablish themselves within the  Union. It was the ﬁ
rst effort to 
bring about a reconstruction of the fractured nation. And it was a 

relatively mild plan, one Radical Republicans strongly opposed. In 

their view Congress must administer the restoration of the  Union, not 

the President. 
Meanwhile the war ground to an inevitable end. General Ulysses S. 
Grant, promoted to the rank of lieutenant general and given supreme 
command of the  
Union forces, assumed control of the Army of the 
Potomac, now numbering over 
100
,000. On May 5, 1864
, he began his 
monthlong Wilderness campaign in which he planned to pursue his 

line of attack if it took all summer and thereby shred Lee’s army of 

60,000 to bits. But the slaughter was horrendous. It is estimated that in 
the battles of Spotsylvania and Cold Harbor, Grant’s losses added up 

to nearly 
60,000, as against half that number suffered by Lee. But 
there was no way the Confederates could replace their losses. The 

Confederacy was bleeding to death. Grant then swung his army south 

to Petersburg, about twenty miles below Richmond, expecting to cut 

Lee’s supply lines. He was unable to capture Petersburg and so laid 

siege to the city in June 
1864
; the siege lasted nine months. 
Meanwhile, General William T. Sherman set out with 
100,000 troops 
from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and headed toward Atlanta, Georgia. As 

Vicksburg had sliced the Confederacy vertically, east from west, the 

Chattanooga victory allowed Sherman to initiate an invasion that would 

bisect the South horizontally, upper from lower. On September 
2 he oc
-cupied Atlanta, and after destroying what
ev
er supplies or materials that 
might prove helpful to the enemy, he headed for the sea. 
In Congress, Radical Republicans responded to Lincoln’s  
ten-
percent 
plan by passing the  
Wade-
Davis bill, which required a majority of 
the 
electorate—not ten 
percent—to swear to past and present loyalty 
151 
The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
before any government could be formed. It demanded the abolition of 
slavery and stipulated that no one could vote who had held a state or 

Confederate ofﬁ
ce or who had borne arms against the United States. 
Lincoln, who had already recognized Louisiana and Arkansas as 
rest
ored to the  
Union under his  
ten-
percent plan,  
pocket-
vetoed the 
Wade-Davis bill. He said he was not committed to any single plan of 

reconstruction. He also denied that Congress had the authority to 

abolish slavery in the states. That would require a constitutional 

amendment. 
Radicals shot back with the 
Wad
e-
Davis Manifesto, in which they 
asserted the absolute authority of Congress to deal with the rebellious 

states and instructed the President to execute the laws of the country, 

not legislate them. As commander in chief, Lincoln’s job was to put 

down the rebellion, the document declared, and leave the po
liti
cal 
reor
ganization of the seceded states to Congress. 
Despite their differences the Radicals supported Lincoln’s renomi
-nation for President at the Republican convention in Baltimore on June 

7, 186
4, and  
were delighted with the choice of Andrew Johnson, the 
loyalist military governor of Tennessee, as Vice President because 

Johnson had been a particularly vociferous critic of secessionists when 

he served as a member of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the 

War. The purpose behind nominating Johnson was obvious: the for
-mation of a National 
Un
ion ticket that might attract Demo
cratic voters 
and symbolize the restoration of the  
Union. 
The Demo
crats met in Chicago in late August and nominated Gen
-eral McClellan and George H. Pendleton of Ohio. Under Copperhead 
con
trol, the convention adopted a platform that called for the immedi
-ate cessation of hostilities and the establishment of peace on the basis 

of
 a federated  
union of states, a platform that McClellan repudiated. 
The National 
Un
ion ticket was strengthened by Sherman’s capture 
of Atlanta and his continuing march toward the sea. That victory may 

well have made the difference as to which party would win. Lincoln 

was overwhelmingly reelected in November, with an electoral vote of 

212
 to 21 and a pop 
ular vote of 
2,206,938
 to McClellan’s 
1,803
,787
. When Congress reconvened, the President asked that an amend
-ment ending slavery throughout the United States be adopted and 

se
nt to the states for ratiﬁ
cation. The Senate had already passed it the 
152 
a short history of the united states 
previous spring. It was now up to the  
Hou
se. On January 
31, 1865
, the 
vote was called. The galleries  
were packed, and in the chamber sat the 
Chief Justice of the United States, Salmon P. Chase; several associate 
justices; a number of senators; several members of the cabinet; and a 

group of foreign ministers. And the amendment passed, 
119
 to 56. With the announcement of the result, the entire 
House burst into a 
storm of screams, shouts, applause, and stamping of feet. Women 

waved their handkerchiefs; men threw their arms around each other; 

“and cheer after cheer, and burst after burst followed.” For ten minutes 

the noise level did not abate. Finally adjournment was moved “in honor 

of the sublime and immortal event.” On December 
18, 1865
, three-
fourths of the states ratiﬁ
ed this Thirteenth Amendment. 
By late 
1864
 the war was clearly coming to an end. Sherman cut a 
60-mile-wide, 
300
-mile path to the sea, destroying homes, public 
buildings, factories, cotton gins, railroads, and bridges, or conﬁ
 scating 
anything that might be regarded as contraband or assist the rebels in 

their effort to stay the course. Looting was commonplace. Savannah 

fell on December 
22, after which Sherman headed north through the 
Carolinas, burning towns and cities in his wake. Columbia, the capital 

of South Carolina, was a prize target, and its destruction on February 

17, 1865
, predictable, although retreating Confederate soldiers were later 
blamed by Sherman for the tragedy. A determined Sherman plowed 

straight ahead, and an increasingly demoralized Confederate force 

could not bar his way. 
Lincoln made clear how he now intended to proceed with recon
-struction. In his second inaugural address on March 
4, 1865, he said, 
“With malice toward none, with charity for all, with ﬁ
rmness in the 
right . . .  
let us strive on to ﬁ
nish the work we are in, to bind up the na-
tion’s wounds . . .  
to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and 
lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.” 
At the same time, Grant pressed forward in Virginia, and Lee was 
force
d to retreat from Petersburg and Richmond in the hope of joining 
forces with a Confederate force in North Carolina, commanded by the 

very capable General Joseph Johnston. But Grant blocked his path and 

on April 
7 asked for Lee’s surrender. His army now numbering only 
30,000 and practically surrounded, Lee had little choice. At Appomat
-tox Court  
Ho
use the two men met on April 
9 and arranged the terms 
153 The Dispute over Slavery, Secession, and the Civil War 
of surrender. Lee’s troops 
were paroled so they could return home, and 
his ofﬁ
 cers 
were permitted to keep their sidearms. In addition, all the 
rebels  
were allowed to retain their own  
horses and mules. All other 
equipment was surrendered to 
Union forces. Grant did not ask for or 
receive Lee’s sword in surrender. 
After four harrowing years of murderous combat the war had ended. 
Th
e South was totally defeated in a lost cause. The numbers of dead on 
both sides  
were staggering. The  
Union suffered 
359,528
 dead and 
275,175 wounded; the Confederates lost approximately 
258
,000 dead and 
100
,000 wounded. 
In the North people shouted their gratitude when they heard the 
ne
ws of Lee’s surrender. Washington was “delirious with gladness” 
when General Grant and his troops came marching through the town. 
April 
13 was “a day of general rejoicing. . . . 
The stars and stripes waved 
ov
er the public and many of the private buildings
. . . . 
As night came 
on . . .  
bonﬁ
res blazed in the streets, and ﬁ
reworks lit up the sky. In the 
forts and camps around the city blazed huge bonﬁ
res, while the heavy 
siege guns thundered their joyful approval of peace.” It was the same in 

many other cities. The horrible war had ended. 
Then tragedy struck. Lincoln had visited Richmond, and only upon 
his ret
urn to Washington did he learn of Lee’s surrender. Once more, 
at a cabinet meeting, he reiterated the need for conciliation and a swift 

return to a re 
united country. In his last public address on April 
11, he 
spoke from the balcony of the White  House to a crowd celebrating the 

Union victory. “We meet this eve 
ning, not in sorrow, but in gladness of 
heart. The evacuations of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender 

of the principal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and speedy 

peace
. . . . Let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restore the 
proper pr
actical relations between these [seceded] states and the 
Union.” 
On April 
14 Li
ncoln attended a perfor
mance of 
Our American Cousin 
in Ford’s Theater, where John Wilkes Booth, a distinguished if crazed 

actor, entered the President’s box shortly after ten PM and shot Lin
-coln at 
point-
blank range. The dying man was carried across the street 
to a lodging  
house where he succumbed at 
seven-
thirty the following 
morning. He had saved the  
Union, only to die before completing the 
task of reconstruction. 
154 
a short history of the united states 
“Now he belongs to the ages,” intoned Edwin Stanton, the secretary 
of
 war. And now Andrew Johnson was President, and would in the fol
-lowing months and years bring about a titanic battle between the ex
-ecutive and legislative branches of the government, a battle that would 
have reper
cussions for generations to come. 
6Reconstruction and the 
Gilde
d Age
Three hours after
 Lincoln died, Andrew Johnson took the 
oath of ofﬁ
ce as President, and the Radical Republicans  
were ec-static. They thought they would have no difﬁ
cu
lty determining the 
course by which the rebellious South would be reconstructed. They 
reckoned that they could control this Tennessean and that he would 

summon them to a special session of Congress or wait until they recon
-vened in December 
186
5 before initiating any presidential action. 
They thought wrong. With the ﬁ
nal su
rrender of the Confederate 
forces, President Johnson basically adopted Lincoln’s plan and recog
-nized the governments already established in Arkansas, Louisiana, 

Te
nnessee, and Virginia by the late President. Johnson also issued two 
proclamations in which he appointed provisional governors in the re
-
maining seven southern states for the purpose of calling state conven
-tions that 
were expected to nullify the ordinances of secession, repudiate 
their Confederate debt, and ratify the Thirteenth Amendment. He 
granted amnesty to all rebels who took an oath of allegiance, but he 

exempted those who had held high ofﬁ
ce in the Confederate govern
-ment or the military. He also exempted from amnesty those who owned 

$20,000 or m
ore in property, a prejudice against the rich and upper 
classes of southern society that reﬂ
ected his bitterness over the poverty 
he suffered as a youth. However, those exempted could apply directly 
156 
a short history of the united states 
to him for individual pardons, and only those with amnesty or pardons 
coul
d participate in reconstructing their states. 
Immediately, the Radicals recognized not only that the President 
pl
anned to undertake the Reconstruction of the South on his own but 
also that he intended to complete it before the 
Thirty-
Ninth Congress 
reconvened. This realization greatly angered those who believed that 

Congress, not the President, was the lawful, constitutional body to re
-unify the country. 
Thaddeus Stevens wasted no time challenging Johnson’s actions. 
Fr
om Philadelphia he wrote the President and expressed his dis 
plea
-sure. “I hope I may be excused for putting briefs on paper,” he declared; 

“wha
t I intended to say to you orally. Reconstruction is a delicate ques
-tion
. . . . It is a question for the Legislative power exclusively.” 
Exclusively! That stated the Radical position exactly. “Better call an 
ex
tra session,” Stevens instructed, “than to allow many to think that 
the executive was approaching usurpation.” He also advised the Presi
-dent to stop the 
who
lesale pardoning of former rebels. The presump
-tion of Stevens in speaking this way and dictating to the chief executive 

what h
e should or should not do was unbelievable. Stevens followed 
through on his return to Washington by confronting Johnson and 

insisting that if he, the President, persisted in executing his plan of 

Reconstruction, he could expect no support or cooperation from Re
-publicans in Congress. 
Johnson remained calm throughout the interview. He appealed for 
un
derstanding and harmony. The people of this nation need to put the 
war behind them in order to restore peace, he said. And that was what 

he was trying to do. Indeed by December every one of the remaining 

seven Confederate states, except Texas, had done exactly what he had 

instructed them to do, and he had recognized them. Four months later 

Texas complied with the requirements. 
When Congress convened on December 
4, Jo
hnson informed the 
members in his ﬁ
rst message that the  
Union was restored, but they re
-sponded by disregarding his announcement and establishing a Joint 

Co
mmittee of Fifteen on Reconstruction with nine members from the 
House and six from the Senate to report on whether the rebel states 

should be represented in Congress. Moreover, until this committee 

issued its report and was approved by Congress, “no member shall be 
157 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
received into either  house from any of the said 
so-called confederate 
states.” Whereupon the representatives from several of the southern 
states who had shown up when this Congress convened quietly with
-drew from the 
Ho
use chamber. Although the Joint Committee had 
Stevens as one of the members, it was essentially moderate in composi
-tion and was chaired by Senator William P. Fessenden of Maine. Dur
-ing their meetings together the committee members heard repeated 

te
stimony from an assortment of witnesses hostile to the Johnson am
-nesty policy and insisted that if representatives from the rebel states 

were readm
itted “the condition of the freedmen would be very little 
better than that of the slaves.” 
As a matter of fact, several Confederate states had already passed a 
se
ries of “Black Codes” deﬁ
ning the condition of the freedmen in such 
a way as to keep them bound to the land. Although they 
were freed, 
these codes virtually restored them to slavery. In the  
House of Repre
-sentatives Thaddeus Stevens railed against these codes, insisting that 

th
e South should be treated as “conquered provinces.” “We have turned 
over, or about to turn loose, four million slaves without a hut to shelter 

them or a cent in their pockets. The infernal laws of slavery have pre
-vented them from an education, understanding the commonest laws of 

con
tract, or of managing the ordinary business of life. This Congress is 
bound to provide for them until they can take care of themselves.” 
In the Senate, Charles Sumner, having recovered from the beating 
inﬂ
icted by Bully Brooks, essentially agreed with Stevens, only he in
-terpreted secession as an act in which the South had committed “state 

sui
cide.” As such only Congress could set the conditions by which 
these states could be admitted back into the  
Union. 
In approaching the problem of Reconstruction, Congress faced a 
sect
ion of the country that lay in ruins: cities and plantations burned, 
transportation wrecked, and billions invested in slavery wiped out. Ste
-vens expected to transform the South through a redistribution of land 

in a
n effort to destroy the power structure of the planter aristocracy, 
and provide the former slaves, now freedmen, with enough land from 

the forfeited property of the enemy so that they could support them
-selves and their families. Congress rejected this proposal. Instead, it 

pa
ssed the Freedmen’s Bureau on March 
3, 1865
 (and repassed the mea
-sure on July 
16 over a pr
esidential veto), and a supplementary act in 
158 
a short history of the united states 
February 
1866
, that made permanent a bureau to provide for the freed
-men and southern refugees, both white and black. The act also granted 
ju
dicial power to the bureau to protect the freedmen against discrimi
-nation. It was sponsored by a number of moderate Republicans, such as 

Fe
ssenden and Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, who sought to work with the President to coun
-teract the Black Codes. Unfortunately for Johnson, he chose not to 

seek a
n alliance with moderates and declared that this new bill was 
nothing less than a gigantic pork barrel and prohibitively expensive. 

The  
House overrode his veto, 
109
 to 40, but the Senate sustained it 
when ﬁ
ve moderate Republicans agreed about the cost. 
Other moderates 
were dismayed by t
he President’s action. They 
tried again by passing the Civil Rights Act of 
1866
, a bill that “embod
-ied the moderates’ position” and granted civil rights to all persons born 

in t
he United States, except Native Americans. It spelled out rights to 
be “enjoyed equally without regard to race,” such as initiating lawsuits 

and contracts, giving testimony in court, and obtaining “security of 

person and property.” It authorized federal ofﬁ
cers to bring suit in fed
-eral courts against violators, and it imposed ﬁ
ne
s and imprisonment on 
anyone who deprived citizens of their rights. To placate the President it 

did not grant po
liti
cal rights to freedmen. That was made very explicit 
by Trumbull. 
This civil rights legislation was “the ﬁ
rst st
atutory deﬁ
nition of the 
rights of American citizenship” and “reﬂ
ected how ideas once consid
-ered Radical had been adopted” by a large number of Republicans. 

An
d it applied to the North, where discriminatory laws had been en
-acted and  
were still operative, as well as to the South. As such it was 
not strictly a Reconstruction mea
sure. 
Nevertheless, Johnson vetoed it. He claimed that it violated “all our 
ex
perience as a people” and constituted “a stride toward centralization 
and the concentration of all legislative powers in the national Govern
-ment.” Furthermore, in an outburst that was blatantly racist, Johnson 

sai
d that he doubted blacks could qualify for citizenship and insisted 
that the states had the right to discriminate on the basis of race. 
Both 
houses of Congress erupted. 
Moderates  were appalled—and 
completely alienated. They wanted to cooperate with Johnson but now 
felt totally rejected. The 
New York Herald
, on March 
28, 1866
, called 
159 Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
the veto “a declaration of war.” Clearly, cried the outraged Trumbull 
on the Senate ﬂ
oor, the President will approve no bill that would pro
-tect “the freedmen in their liberty and their property.” Both the  House 

an
d the Senate promptly overrode the veto. The Civil Rights Act of 
1866
 was the ﬁ
rst major piece of legislation in American history to be 
enacted over the objections of the President. 
It was important in another way. In effect it announced that the 
na
tional government had the responsibility of protecting the rights 
of citizens, not the states. The concerns about states’ rights that had 

plagued the nation for generations  were swept away. From now on, 

equality before the law would be enforced by the national government. 
By his veto, Johnson lost what
ev
er support he had once enjoyed 
among moderate Republicans. They quietly drifted over to the side of 

the Radicals. Any future vetoes  
were sure to be overridden. What the 
President had done was commit po
liti
cal suicide. 
Still, a genuine concern for the constitutionality of the Civil Rights 
Act bo
thered many members, so the Joint Committee of Fifteen pro
-posed the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which deﬁ
 ned 
citizenship in a manner that included black males and forbade any state 
from infringing the rights of citizens without due pro
cess of law. It 
abrogated the  
three-
ﬁfths clause of the Constitution in calculating 
repre
senta
tion in the lower  
House of Congress, which thereby added 
twelve southern seats when these states  were readmitted. 
Since this amendment speciﬁ
cal
ly introduced the word “male” into 
the Constitution, feminists such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth 

Cady Stanton felt betrayed. Men protected their own rights, they com
-plained, but not the rights of females. Very well, women would now 

rely on
 their own efforts, and in 
1869
 they formed the National Woman 
Suffrage Association, which admitted only women. But the American 

Woman Suffrage Association, formed immediately thereafter, wel
-comed both men and women. The two groups subsequently merged 

un
der Stanton’s leadership and became the National Woman Suffrage 
Association. The ﬁ
ght for suffrage equality now began in earnest. 
Tennessee ratiﬁ
ed th
e Fourteenth Amendment and was immedi
-ately readmitted to the  
Un
ion on July 
24, 1866
. But the other southern 
states refused, in the hope that the midterm election in 
1866
 would re
-sult in a defeat of the Radicals and the election of a Congress that 
160 a short history of the united states 
would provide a milder form of Reconstruction. As a result of their 
reject
ion, Congress made ratiﬁ
 cation of the Fourteenth Amendment a 
condition for the southern states to win readmission to the  Union. 
Conditions in the South worsened. Race riots broke out in Memphis 
an
d New Orleans in the spring and summer of 
1866
. In Memphis an 
altercation between white and black drivers of horse- 
drawn hacks on 
May 
1 started a  
free-
for-
all that ended with 
forty-
eight persons dead 
(all but two  
were blacks); ﬁ
ve black women raped; and many schools, 
churches, and homes burned to the ground. Twelve weeks later, New 

Orleans erupted in violence on the opening day of a constitutional con
-vention that had been summoned to enfranchise freedmen. A massacre 

of b
lacks in the convention hall resulted, even though white ﬂ
 ags of 
surrender  
were raised. These unfortunate incidents only proved to north
-erners that the South was unregenerate, that it was still arrogant and 

deﬁan
t. It proved that the rebel states were not ready to be restored to 
full membership in the  
Union. 
In an effort to turn the situation around in this election year, Presi
-dent Johnson undertook a speaking tour of the North, stopping off at 

Phi
ladelphia and New York and then swinging around to Cleveland 
and St.  
Louis—a tour that was laughingly called a “swing around the 
circle.” Accompanied by General Grant, Admiral David Farragut, and 

Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, Johnson stumped the North; but 

during his speeches he frequently lost his temper, giving his opponents 

additional ammunition with which to ridicule and demean him. At 

times he seemed hysterical, wild, certainly unpresidential. “I have been 

traduced,” he ranted. “I have been slandered. I have been maligned. 

I have been called Judas Iscariot
. . . . Who has been my Christ that 
I have played the Judas role? Was it Thad Stevens?” 
The tour was a disaster, and the electorate showed its disgust by 
tr
ouncing the Demo
crats at the polls. Republicans now had a  
two-
thirds 
majority with which to override any future presidential veto. Johnson 

was completely neutralized. “The President has no power to control or 

inﬂ
uence anybody,” claimed Senator James W. Grimes of Iowa, “and 
legislation will be carried on entirely regardless of his opinions or 

wishes.” 
“It is now our turn to act,” declared Representative James A. Gar
-ﬁeld of Ohio. The Confederate states “would not  
co-operate with us in 
161 Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
rebuilding what they destroyed. We must remove the rubbish and build 
from the bottom.” George Julian of Indiana agreed. The South does 

not need oaths of loyalty that invite men to perjure themselves. What 

they need is “government, the strong arm of power, outstretched from 

the central authority  
here in Washington.” 
And that arm of power struck with the return of Congress after the 
elect
ion. On January 
3, 1867
, Thaddeus Stevens introduced the ﬁ
 rst 
Reconstruction Act, which after several amendments became known 

as the Military Reconstruction Act. It divided the South into ﬁ
 ve military districts and gave the commander of each district the right to 

declare martial law in order to preserve order, protect blacks, and begin 

the pro
cess of restoring the former Confederate states to the  
Union. 
The pro
cess involved calling new constitutional conventions, elected 
by blacks and those whites who had not participated in the rebellion. 

These conventions must guarantee black suffrage and ratify the Four
-teenth Amendment. Naturally, Johnson vetoed the bill, and Congress 

overrode it on March 
2, 1867
. Congress then proceeded to add Supplementary Reconstruction 
Acts
, which directed the military commanders to begin the enrollment 
of voters, and after a proper constitution had been written and ap
-proved by the reformed electorate, to put it into operation. Congress, of 

cour
se, reserved to itself the exclusive right to review each new consti
-tution, end military rule at the proper time, and accept states back into 

th
e  Union and seat their representatives. It also passed the Army Ap
-propriations Act, which directed that the President, in his capacity as 

com
mander in chief, must issue all military orders through the General 
of the Army, U. S. Grant, whose ofﬁ
ce could not be moved from 
Washington without Senate approval. In the Tenure of Ofﬁ
 ce Act, 
Congress further restricted presidential authority from removing ofﬁ
 -cials approved by the Senate without ﬁ
rs
t obtaining the consent of the 
Senate. “Though the President is  
Commander-
in- 
Chief,” ranted Ste
-vens, “Congress is his commander; and God willing, he shall obey. He 

an
d his minions shall learn that this is not a Government of kings 
and satraps, but a Government of the people, and that Congress is the 

people.” 
In the South the provisional governments established by Johnson 
were swep
t away, and the registration of blacks and acceptable whites 
162 
a short history of the united states 
began. Those white southerners who cooperated with Radical Recon
-struction 
were la
beled “scalawags” and those northern whites who trav
-eled into the military districts to advance the Radical cause  
were ca
lled 
“carpetbaggers.” It was not surprising that when eligible voters 
were tabulated, at least ﬁ
ve southern 
states—Louisiana, Mississippi, Ala
-bama, Florida, and South  
Ca
rolina—had a majority of blacks. There 
were over 700
,000 black registered voters, compared with 
60,000
 white 
registered voters. 
Over the next several months these southern conventions met and 
pr
epared constitutions as required. By June 
1868
, six of the former 
Confederate states 
were admitted, and with their approval the Four
-teenth Amendment was ratiﬁ
 ed on
 July 
28, 1868
. The six included Ar
-kansas (June 
22),
 Florida (June 
25), North Carolina (July 
4), Louisiana 
(July 
9), South Carolina (July 
9), and Alabama (July 
13). Georgia had 
been restored on July 
21, but Congress did not seat its representatives. It 
was readmitted on July 
15, 1870
, and its members took their seats the 
following January. 
President Johnson tried to block Radical Reconstruction by remov
-ing those ofﬁ
cers and commanders who he felt 
we
re particularly ardent 
in enforcing the Reconstruction Acts. Accordingly, he removed several 
military commanders, and on August 
12, 1867
, he dismissed Secretary 
of War Edwin Stanton, a holdover from the Lincoln administration, 

and replaced him with General Grant. In complying with the Tenure 

of Ofﬁ
ce Act, Johnson submitted to the Senate his reasons for sus
-pending Stanton, which the upper  
ho
use rejected, 
36 to 6, in January 
1868
. Grant was persuaded by the Radicals to relinquish his ofﬁ
 ce, and 
Stanton resumed his position. 
Undaunted and still deﬁ
an
t, Johnson sacked Stanton a second time 
on February 
21, 1868
, accusing Grant of treachery, and appointed Adju
-tant General Lorenzo Thomas to take Stanton’s place. That same day, 

Re
presentative John Covode of Pennsylvania offered a motion on the 
House ﬂ
oor that “Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, be 
impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors in ofﬁ
ce.” The motion 
was referred to the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which in turn 

brought the motion to the ﬂ
oor for a vote with its approval. After an 
intense debate, the  House, by a vote of 
126 to 47, gave its approval on 
February 
24, 1868
; a committee was formed to prepare the articles of 
163 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
impeachment; and on March 
2 the committee brought in nine charges. 
These articles dealt mainly with alleged violations of the Tenure of Of
-ﬁce Act, but they also included accusations of a conspiracy by intimida
-tion and threats to prevent Stanton from holding ofﬁ
ce. Th
e following 
day the  
House added two more articles: one accusing the President of 
“violent utterances” and the other a catchall called the omnibus article. 

Seven members  
were appointed to prosecute the charges in the Senate; 
the most prominent of these  
were Ben “Beast” Butler, Thaddeus Ste
-vens, George Boutwell, and John A. Bingham. 
Opening statements by the members before the Senate began on 
Mar
ch 
30 with Chief Justice Salmon Portland Chase presiding. But 
the prosecutors merely harangued the senators and assumed that the 

ultimate verdict was a foregone conclusion. They did not offer tangible 

evidence of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” 
On May 
16 th
e senators voted the omnibus article ﬁ
rst, and Johnson 
escaped removal by a vote of 
35 in favor to 
19 opposed, just one vote shy 
of the required  
two-
thirds necessary for conviction. The nineteen in
-cluded seven Republicans and twelve Demo
cr
ats. Senator Edmund G. 
Ross of Kansas, a Radical Republican, showed courage and conviction 

by voting for acquittal. When several more articles failed to convict 

Johnson, the Senate on May 
26 adjourned as a court of impeachment. 
When Stevens was informed of the verdict, he cried out, “The country 

is going to the dev
il.” He died shortly thereafter. When asked about 
the court’s decision, Senator James Grimes of Iowa declared that they 

had been asked to make a decision based on politics. “I can not agree to 

destroy the harmonious working of the Constitution for the sake of 

getting rid of an unacceptable President.” 
The decision marked the end of the kind of presidential power exer
-cised by Abraham Lincoln. Johnson had tried and failed to control 

Reconstruction. By its actions, Congress had assumed command of 
national policy in restoring the  
Union. This is the way it should be, 
insisted Senator John Sherman of Ohio: the executive “should be sub
-ordinate to the legislative branch,” just as the found 
ers i
ntended. 
Shortly afterward, the 
Republican national nominating con
-vention met in Chicago and on the ﬁ
rs
t ballot chose Ulysses S. Grant as 
164 
a shor t h istory of th e united stat es 
its presidential candidate, along with Schuyler Colfax, the Radical 
Spea
ker of the  
House of Representatives, as his running mate. The 
Demo
crats nominated Horatio Seymour, former governor of New 
York; and Francis P. Blair of Missouri, who  
were defeated by a lopsided 
vote in the electoral college (
80 to 214
) by the Republican ticket. 
The strength and determination of the Radicals were again demon
-strated by the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitu
-tion on February 
26, 1869
. This amendment forbade any state to deny a 
citizen the right to vote on account of race, color, or previous condition 

of servitude. All unreconstructed states had to ratify this amendment 

before they could be considered ready for readmission to the  
Union. 
Virginia was restored on January 
26, 1870
; Mississippi on February 
23; and Texas on March 
30. The Fifteenth Amendment was declared rati
-ﬁed on March 
30, 1870
. These reconstructed southern states sent the ﬁ
rst o
f a long line of 
African-
Americans to Congress as both representatives and senators. 
Hiram R. Revels, a Republican from Mississippi, won election to the 

Senate. A  
Methodist-
Episcopal minister, he had served as chaplain of 
a black regiment during the Civil War. He took his seat on February 

25, 1870
. In the  
House, the ﬁ
 rst 
African-
American to gain election was 
Joseph H. Rainey, a Republican from South Carolina, who was sworn 

in on December 
12, 1870
. He had been a barber on a Confederate 
blockade runner and was the ﬁ
rst black man to preside over the  
House 
when Speaker James G. Blaine of Maine turned the gavel over to him 

in May 
1874
. Other  
African-
Americans who  
were House members during these 
years included Benjamin S. Turner of Alabama, Robert C. De Large 

and Robert B. Elliott of South Carolina, Josiah T. Walls of Florida, 

and Jefferson F. Long of 
Georgia—all Republicans. A total of sixteen 
African-
Americans served in Congress during Reconstruction, but 
each served only one or two terms. 
Throughout Reconstruction military courts  
were emp
loyed to carry 
out the directives of the various laws passed by Congress. But in 
Ex parte Milligan
, the Supreme Court ruled that martial law was unconsti
-tutional where civil courts  
were in o
peration. Fearful that the court 
might invalidate the Reconstruction Acts, Congress passed legislation 

in March 
1868
 that denied it jurisdiction in the matter. Still, the Court 
165 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
upheld the right of Congress to reconstruct and in 
Texas v. White
 af-ﬁrmed the argument by Andrew Jackson and Abraham  
Lincoln that 
the  
Union was indissoluble. More important, through a number of de
-cisions over the next several years it slowly gained recognition as the 
ﬁnal i
nterpreter of the Constitution, a claim not speciﬁ
cally stated in 
the document itself. 
Although the Fifteenth Amendment forbade states from denying 
ci
tizens the right to vote on account of race, it did not forbid states from 
enacting literacy, educational, and property tests that whites would later 

invoke when military reconstruction ended. With these instruments 

they effectively disenfranchised 
African-
Americans and ultimately re
-stored white rule in the South. They claimed to have “Redeemed” their 

stat
es from what they called “Black Reconstruction.” 
But one of the more effective ways of preventing blacks from voting 
wa
s by intimidation. The Ku Klux Klan, founded in Pulaski, Tennes
-see, in 
1866
, with the former Confederate general Nathan Bedford For
-rest as the ﬁ
rst Gr
and Wizard, aimed speciﬁ
cally at restoring white 
rule through violence and lawlessness by striking terror among blacks 

if they dared to vote. Lynchings and beatings became daily occur
-rences, especially during elections, and it has been estimated that ap
-proximately 
400
 hangings of 
African-
Americans occurred between 
1868
 and 
1871
. This resort to violence only convinced northerners that enforcement 
of f
ederal law by federal troops in the South was necessary and justi
-ﬁed. Accordingly, Congress passed three Enforcement Acts in 
1870– 1871
, the ﬁ
rst two of which outlawed the use of force or intimidation to 
prevent citizens from exercising their right of suffrage and provided 

federal supervisors to oversee the registration of voters. The third 

Enforcement Act, also called the Ku Klux Klan Act, empowered the 

President to use the military to protect black voters from intimidation 

and violence and to suspend the writ of habeas corpus when necessary. 

Not until the Democrats returned to power some twenty years later 

were these “Force Acts,” as they called them, repealed. But the Grant 

administration slowly moved away from employing the military and 

the courts to carry out Congressional Reconstruction, and consequently 

whites gradually “Redeemed” their states from Republican rule. More 

and more  
ex-
Confederates 
were elected to Congress, including the 
166 
a short history of the united states 
former Vice President of the Confederacy, Alexander H. Stephens; six 
ca
binet ofﬁ
 cers
; ﬁ
 fty-
eight members of the Confederate Congress; and 
nine 
high-
ranking army ofﬁ
cers. The South was slowly being reclaimed 
by its former ruling class. 
But Congress did attempt to protect certain rights of 
African-
Am
ericans from infringement by whites. The Civil Rights Act of 
1875 prohibited racial discrimination in public accommodations, public 

transportation, and jury selection. The bill was passed and signed by 

President Grant on March 
1, 1875. It was a landmark event. It culminated what was a constitutional 
re
volution. Together with ratiﬁ
cation of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, 
and Fifteenth amendments, this Civil Right Act extended equality 

under the law to millions. Democracy in America had made a notice
-able advance. It only remained to grant these privileges to all persons 

rega
rdless of gender. 
And a new 
age began, an age that extended to the end of the cen
-tury, an age Mark Twain and coauthor Charles Dudley Warner de
-
scribed in a book depicting American society. This society was 

pr
ofoundly corrupt. The main characters in their book are involved in 
a railroad bribery scheme in which the government is a participant. It 

was a “tale of today,” the coauthors wrote in 
1873
, because it typiﬁ
 ed business operations throughout the nation following the Civil War. 

The book was titled 
The Gilded Age. 
Henry Adams, an historian of note and a contemporary, described 
th
is era as “poor in purpose and barren in results. One might search the 
list of Congress, Judiciary, and Executive during the  
twenty-
ﬁ ve years, 
1870
–1895, and ﬁ
nd little but damaged reputations.” There was more 
than simply damaged reputations, but the damage was quite extensive 

and reached right up the po
liti
cal chain of command. 
The industrialization of the country, stimulated by the Civil War 
an
d continuing unabated to the end of the nineteenth century, resulted 
in large mea 
sure from the direct and indirect support and subsidy given 
it by government, especially the national government. The railroads 

throughout the nation expanded from over 
30,000 miles of track to an 
estimated 
200
,000, and this expansion involved extensive public assis
-167 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
tance, particularly land grants. Protective tariffs  
were another form of 
support and stimulated such manufactures as steel, copper, and wool. 
In addition, federal banking and monetary policies attracted both for
-eign and domestic investors. 
Money ﬂ
owe
d, bringing 
unheard-
of wealth to those individuals 
who knew how to obtain privileges that would advance their goals. Of 

course, it came at a price. Bribery, conspiracy, conﬂ
ict of interest, 
blackmail, and other assorted crimes 
were commonplace during the 
Gilded Age. It was a matter of recognizing the appropriate targets. 

Quite obviously, for the railroads and those needing tariff protection 

the targets  
were congressmen and ofﬁ
cers of the national administra
-tion. As it turned out, during this era such targets proved to be willing 

reci
pients of what ever largess was offered. Congressmen chose to ac
-cept them as gifts in appreciation and recognition of their status and 

im
portance. They liked to believe there was nothing wrong in provid
-ing favors through legislative action and then receiving appropriate 

ack
nowledgment for their efforts. 
Railroads offered free passes, stock in the company, and even cash to 
appropri
ate legislators, especially chairmen of key committees. Some 
congressmen even held executive positions or served on railroad boards. 

Representative Grenville Dodge, for example, held the position of chief 

engineer of the  
Union Paciﬁ
c all the while he represented his Iowa dis
-trict in the  
Ho
use of Representatives. The  
so-called ﬁ
nancier of the Civil 
War, Jay Cooke, regularly conferred ﬁ
nancial favors on congressmen 
and even held the mortgage on the home of Speaker James G. Blaine. 
Sooner or later these cozy and usually improper arrangements  were 
cert
ain to explode into public print, and in the de 
cade of the 
1870
s they 
did. The ﬁ
rst and perhaps most notorious was the Credit Mobilier 
scandal. It was uncovered by Charles A. Dana’s 
New York Sun
 on Sep
-tember 
4, 1872, an
d exposed the involvement of not only the former 
Speaker of the  
House and current Vice President of the United States, 
Schuyler Colfax, but Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, who succeeded 

Colfax as Grant’s running mate in the presidential election of 
1872. Also included 
were George  
Boutwell—the secretary of the treasury 
and one of the prosecutors of the Johnson impeachment  
trial—and at 
least a dozen congressmen, including James A. Garﬁ
eld, chairman of 
the Committee on Appropriations; Henry L. Dawes, chairman of 
The extent of the railroads in the United States in 1880
169 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
Ways and Means; William D. (“Pig Iron”) Kelley, chairman of the 
Civil Ser
vice Committee; John A. Bingham, chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee and another of Johnson’s prosecutors; and Glenn W. Sco
-ﬁeld, chairman of the Naval Committee. Quite a group! 
Credit Mobilier was a dummy construction company formed by the 
Un
ion Paciﬁ
 c Railroad to provide proﬁ
 ts from the building of the line 
which  
were distributed to worthy congressmen in return for po
liti
cal 
favors. Republican Representative Oakes Ames of Massachusetts sold 

the stock to select members of the  
House, who  
were expected to use 
their po
liti
cal inﬂ
uence to beneﬁ
t the company. It was alleged that to 
show their appreciation these congressmen helped kill a bill that would 

have regulated the  
Union Paciﬁ
c’s railroad rates. 
These revelations came late in the presidential election of 
1872 and therefore had little effect on its outcome. Grant was reelected, and his 
running mate, Henry Wilson, won the Vice Presidency. They defeated 

the Liberal Republican ticket of Horace Greeley, editor of the 
New 
York Tribune
, and B. Gratz Brown. This Liberal Republican faction 
had developed within the Republican Party in 
1871
 in an effort to 
provide needed civil ser
vice and tariff reforms. It was led by the 
German-
born Senator Carl Schurz, a former  
Union general. 
The Demo
cratic Party chose to endorse Greeley and Brown rather 
than name its own candidates. A Prohibition Party selected James Black 
and John Russell as its ticket. Throughout the campaign, Republicans 

“waved the bloody shirt” as a reminder of the recent rebellion and suc
-cessfully linked the Liberal Republicans, who opposed further federal 

in
tervention in the South, with unreconstructed southern rebels. Greeley 
himself was a feeble candidate and died a few weeks after the election. 
Once Congress reconvened following the election, a committee was 
im
mediately formed to investigate the Credit Mobilier scandal. The 
accused testiﬁ
ed before the committee, and Ames denied that he had 
ever bribed a member. All he did was sell stock to his colleagues as a 

sound investment. It was business, nothing more. But the committee 

found Ames “guilty of selling to members of Congress shares of stock 

in the Credit Mobilier of America, for prices much below the true 

value of such stock, with the intent thereby to inﬂ
uence the votes and 
decisions of such members in matters to be brought before Congress 

for action.” It also recommended his expulsion from the  House. But 
170 
a short history of the united states 
the  
House, demonstrating genuine concern for a colleague, by a vote of 
115 to 110
 and 
15 abstentions, chose merely to “condemn” his conduct. 
When the decision was announced, something strange and unbelievable 
happened: Republicans who had just voted to condemn Ames crowded 

around him and asked his pardon. “We know you are innocent,” they 

babbled, “but we had to do it in order to satisfy our constituents.” 
As for the other members mentioned in the scandal, the committee 
decl
ared that they might have been “indiscreet” in accepting stock in 
the company, but that they 
were not guilty of criminal intent. In fact 
most of them returned the stock as soon as the scandal came to light 

and denied making any appreciable ﬁ
 nancial gain. 
Although Ames was not expelled from the House, his term in ofﬁ
 ce wa
s due to expire momentarily, and he died shortly thereafter. As for 
the others implicated in the scandal, most of them survived, except 

Schuyler Colfax who had contradicted himself so often during his ap
-pearances before the committee that the public turned against him and 

his c
areer ended in disgrace. 
Revelations of other scandals soon followed. Congress busied itself 
sett
ing up committees to investigate several charges initiated by news
-papers, such as the 
St. Louis Demo crat
, th
at exposed the “Whiskey 
Ring” in the spring of 
1875. And, as it turned out, President Grant’s 
personal secretary, General Orville E. Babcock, allegedly directed the 

“Ring,” by which the government was defrauded of millions of dollars 

in taxes through the sale of forged revenue stamps. Indictments of 

more than 
200
 individuals resulted, many in the Trea
sury Department. 
Although indicted himself, Babcock escaped imprisonment through 

the intervention of the President. 
The Secretary of War, William W. Belknap, was impeached by the 
House on March 
2, 1876
, for accepting bribes for the sale of trading 
posts in the Indian Territory. He resigned to avoid a trial in the Senate. 

But the Trea
sury and War departments  
were not the only ones to dab
-ble in embezzlement and fraud; the Freedmen’s Bureau, the Navy De
-partment, the Interior Department, the Post Ofﬁ
ce, a
nd the attorney 
general’s ofﬁ
 ce helped themselves to whatever largess they could iden
-tify, resulting in numerous indictments, resignations, and, on occasion, 

con
victions. 
One disgrace followed another, and it seemed as though few govern
-171 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
mental agencies could resist the temptation to put their hands in the 
till. Congress itself plundered the Trea
sury in March 
1873
 by passing 
the  
so-called “Salary Grab Act,” by which the President’s salary was 
doubled to $
50,000 and the salaries of representatives and senators 
were raised from $
5,000 to $
7,500
. Worse, the raise for congressmen 
was awarded retroactively, thereby giving each member a $
5,000 bo-nus. But the public reacted so vehemently that Congress promptly re
-
pealed the law at its very next session, except for the President’s increase 

an
d that of the judges of the Supreme Court. 
And the former Speaker of the  
Ho
use of Representatives, James G. 
Blaine, now the minority leader and favored candidate for the Republi
-can presidential nomination in 
187
6, was also accused of offering worth
-less bonds as collateral for a loan of $
64,000 whi
ch he had received 
from the 
Union Paciﬁ
c Railroad and which he had never been asked to 
repay. Supposedly he had used his inﬂ
uence as Speaker to obtain for 
the railroad a generous land grant. In a dramatic speech from the ﬂ
 oor 
of the  
House he denied the charges, and his effort was so convincing 
that his audience broke out in wild applause. 
The consequences of these scandals and the involvement of Con
-gress with big business 
were bad enou
gh for the administration and the 
Republican Party, but the onset of the Panic of 
1873
 proved devastating. 
This was an economic depression that hit hard and lasted from 
1873
 to 1879
. Triggered by the wild speculation in railroads, dishonest banking 
practices, overexpansion in industry, commerce, and agriculture, and 

the failure of Jay Cooke’s banking ﬁ
rm, the Panic generated widespread 
suffering. Three million workers lost their jobs over the next ﬁ
 ve years, 
the stock market collapsed, banks closed, farm prices fell, and one in 

four railroads defaulted on its bonds. 
To counter the depression, Congress released $
26 million in green
-backs. Previously, in February 
1873
, befo
re the Panic struck, it had 
passed the Coinage Act, which eliminated silver coins from circulation 

and designated gold as the only coin to be minted. Then, when the 

country went bust in September with this devastating depression, those 

who favored soft (paper) money such as greenbacks denounced the 

Coinage Act as the “Crime of ’
73.” They demanded a further increase 
in the money supply through the coinage of silver. They insisted that 

millions of silver dollars be minted and circulated at a ratio to gold of 
172 
a short history of the united states 
sixteen to one. They claimed that the recent discovery of silver in the 
mi
nes of Nevada, Colorado, and Utah could easily provide the means 
of achieving this end. 
So in January 
1875, Co
ngress enacted the Specie Resumption Act, 
which increased the supply of greenbacks and made them redeemable 

in gold, starting in January 
1879
. But advocates of soft money kept de
-manding the free and unlimited coinage of silver. Whereupon Richard 

P. 
(“Silver Dick”) Bland of Missouri introduced a bill in the  House 

pr
oviding for the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of 
sixteen to one. But the Senate added an amendment, introduced by 

William B. Allison of Iowa, that the Trea
sury coin not more that $
4 million and not less than $
2 million in silver monthly. This passed, 
over a presidential veto, and only partially satisﬁ
ed the advocates of soft 
money. 
But the Gilded 
Age was not all moral depravity. There  
were som
e bright spots, such as the technological advances in industry and 
agriculture, the growth of big business, the availability of money, the 
continued attraction of foreign capital, and the increased number of 

immigrants into the United States. All these developments, and more, 

changed the nation dramatically. The telegraph stretched across the 

continent, as did the railroads. The telephone and typewriter  
were in
-vented, and a cable was successfully laid across the Atlantic Ocean, 

pr
oviding quicker and cheaper communication between the continents. 
The Edison Electric Illuminating Company constructed the ﬁ
 rst elec
-tric plant in New York City in 
188
2, and soon homes and city streets 
were illuminated by electricity. Technological advances in agriculture 

allowed farmers to grow enough crops not only to feed the nation but 

to export the surplus abroad. 
As a result, the nation expanded at the same time that it engaged in 
reconst
ructing the  Union. Both these major  
events—Reconstruction 
and the industrialization of 
America—occurred simultaneously. Not 
surprisingly, northern states were constantly distracted from the prob
-
lems of Reconstruction and the need for reform. They focused instead 

on
 making money and those capitalistic developments that were trans
-173 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
forming American life. As the Republican governor of South Carolina 
remarked, “The North is tired of the Southern question.” 
But the Grant administration ended on a happy note in 
187
6. The 
nation celebrated the centennial year of the Republic—one hundred 

years of in
de pen
dence under a government that had continued to evolve 
as a democracy in which adult male suffrage had been achieved and a 

society created that was undergoing rapid industrialization. 
It was also a presidential election year. The Republicans decided 
ag
ainst nominating James G. Blaine, because of the suspicions recently 
raised against him. Instead, they chose Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio 

for President and William A. Wheeler of New York for Vice President. 

The scandals of the Grant administration, to say nothing of the Panic 

of 1873
, did not bode well for a Republican victory at the polls, and that 
is why the party picked someone untainted by scandal. Hayes enjoyed 

an “unblemished reputation” and so he won the nomination. 
The Democrats decided on Samuel J. Tilden of New York, one of 
th
e richest corporate lawyers in America, who had prosecuted and bro
-ken up the Tweed Ring. They named Thomas A. Hendricks of Indi
-ana as his running mate. And the November election pretty much 

va
lidated what had been predicted. Tilden received 
250,000 more pop
-ular votes than Hayes. He also won the “Redeemed” southern states 

al
ong with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana for a total 
of 184
 electoral votes. 
Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina still lingered as Republican 
enc
laves, but the white population was determined to reassert control. 
There was a good deal of fraud and intimidation in the voting in these 

states, and consequently two sets of electoral returns  
were reported 
from each: one declaring Tilden the winner, the other Hayes. The re
-
sults from the Oregon contest  
we
re also in dispute. Of all these dis
-puted votes Tilden only needed a single electoral vote from one of these 

sta
tes to win the presidency. Hayes needed them all. 
So Congress decided to allow a special committee to decide which 
vote
s should be counted. This Electoral Commission would consist of 
ﬁve members from the  
House and the Senate and ﬁ
ve justices from the 
Supreme Court. Of these ﬁ
fteen, seven would be Republican and seven 
Demo
cratic. The ﬁ
fteenth member was expected to be Justice David 
174 
a short history of the united states 
Davis, an in
de pen
dent. But this intended arrangement was foiled when 
the Illinois legislature elected Davis to the U.S. Senate and he was re
-placed on the Electoral Commission by Justice Joseph P. Bradley, a 
Repu
blican. 
The commission began its hearings in early February 
1877
, an
d on 
February 
7 it voted to give all the disputed votes to Hayes. The vote 
was 8 to 7, along strict party lines. The  
Demo
cratic-
controlled  
House 
threatened to prevent, by ﬁ
libustering, the formal and constitutional 
requirement that Congress count the ballots. As March 
4, the day of 
the inauguration, approached, there was fear that the Grant adminis
-tration would expire without anyone constitutionally qualiﬁ
ed to
 take 
its place. Southern congressmen  
were lobbied to vote for Hayes with 
promises that as President he would withdraw all federal troops from 

the South, appoint at least one southerner to the cabinet, and provide a 

generous share of federal patronage and sufﬁ
 cient funds to rebuild the 
South’s shatt
ered economy. 
And that did it. On March 
2, 187
7, at four AM, Rutherford B. 
Hayes was declared the new President by an electoral vote of 
185
 to 184. 
The result was predictable. The Democrats, and Tilden in par
tic 
ular, 
failed to provide leadership in settling the dispute. They failed to un
-dertake a public protest for the justice of their cause. They failed to 

encou
rage southerners to denounce what was declared in dispute. They 
failed to ask Hayes to concede at the very beginning of the contest, 

when he might have done so. And by their failures they encouraged the 

opposition to pursue an admittedly unlikely course of action that ulti
-mately led to Hayes’s victory. 
Because March 
4 fell on a Sunday, Hayes was inaugurated privately 
in the Red Room of the White  
House, with Chief Justice Morrison R. 
Waite administering the oath of ofﬁ
ce. On Monday, March 
5, the pub
-lic inauguration took place without demonstrations or trouble. On the 

sam
e day, Hayes appointed David M. Key of Tennessee as postmaster 
general, thus fulﬁ
lling one part of the bargain involved in his election. 
One month later the President withdrew all federal troops from the 

South, bringing Reconstruction to a close. It had taken exactly twelve 

years to ﬁ
nally stitch the  
Union back together again. 
But any number of people regarded this election as one more ex
-ample of the po
liti
cal corruption that existed in Washington and was 
175 Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
so prevalent during the Gilded Age. As a matter of fact, there  were 
scandals beyond the nation’s capital. In New York the Tweed Ring 

had robbed the city of millions until Tilden broke it up. William 

Marcy Tweed was the boss of Tammany Hall, the city’s Democratic 

machine, and his henchmen raided the municipal trea
sury and took 
anywhere between $
100
 million and $
200
 million through kickbacks, 
fake vouchers, padded bills, and other fraudulent devices. Tweed was 

arrested, convicted of these assorted crimes, and died in prison, al
-though several other hoodlums in the ring escaped to Europe with 

their loot. 
And there was considerable corruption in the South, where the re
-building of a shattered economy and society allowed scalawags, carpet
-baggers, and the criminally minded to arrange contracts and bids for 

socia
l services that resulted in higher taxes and increased state indebt
-edness. In some instances the debt was tripled in just a few years. There 

were al
so many opportunities to cheat, defraud, steal, and commit 
bribery. Even after the South was “Redeemed” these criminal activities 

continued, and in some instances grew worse. But it should be pointed 

out that during “Black Reconstruction” a good deal of the money was 

spent on hospitals, public education, and various asylums that beneﬁ
 ted 
the poor and disabled. 
An important source of corruption in the nation’s capital emanated 
fr
om the abuse of the patronage system. Civil ser
vice reform was des
-perately needed. Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York sneeringly re
-ferred to it as “snivel ser
vi
ce.” “During the last 
twenty-
ﬁ ve years,” 
commented Representative James Garﬁ
eld, “it has been understood by 

the Congress and the people, that ofﬁ
 ces are to be obtained by the aid 
of senators and representatives, who thus become the dispensers, some
-times the brokers of patronage.” Frankly, he continued, the Tenure of 

Ofﬁ
ce Act “has virtually resulted in the usurpation, by the senate, of a 
large share of the appointing power.” This mea
sure “has resulted in 
seriously crippling the just powers of the executive, and has placed in 

the hands of senators and representatives a power most corrupting and 

dangerous.” 
President Hayes tried to regain control of appointments by chal
-lenging one of the most powerful ﬁ
gu
res in Congress, Senator Conk-
ling, the leader of the “Stalwart” or Radical faction of the Republican 
176 
a short history of the united states 
Party, by ordering an investigation into the allegedly corrupt patronage 
op
eration in the New York Custom House, the po
liti
cal power base 
of Conkling’s or
ganization. Chester A. Arthur was its collector and 
Alonzo B. Cornell its naval ofﬁ
cer. President Grant had conferred con
-trol of the patronage of the Custom 
House on Conkling, but Hayes was 

determ
ined to terminate it and did so by ﬁ
ring both Arthur and Cornell 
and naming their replacements, who  were subsequently conﬁ
 rmed by 
the Senate. This victory weakened the Stalwart faction within the Re
-publican party and strengthened the “Half Breed” faction, so called 

because t
hey 
were supposedly not  
full-
blooded Republicans. This fac
-tion was headed by James G. Blaine. 
During the ongoing struggle between these two factions, the Re
-publicans held their national nominating convention in Chicago to 

ch
oose the next President. Hayes had previously pledged not to seek a 
second term. To try to bridge the gulf between the opposing factions 

within the party, the convention chose a “dark  
horse” after 
thirty-
six 
ballots. They nominated James A. Garﬁ
 eld for President, and as a sop 
to the Stalwarts and a means of securing New York’s electoral vote, 

they named Chester A. Arthur as Vice President. 
The Demo
cr
ats chose Winﬁ
eld Scott Hancock, a Civil War gen
-eral, and William H. En
glish o
f Indiana to head their ticket. A third 
party also appeared. This was the Greenback Party, whose platform 

advocated money inﬂ
ation, including the free and unlimited coinage of 
silver. It also supported federal regulation of interstate commerce, 

women’s suffrage, and a graduated income tax. This party nominated 

James B. Weaver of Iowa and B. J. Chambers of Texas for President 

and Vice President. And a fourth party, the Prohibition Party, put for
-ward Neal Dow of Maine and A. M. Thompson of Ohio. 
Because of the return of prosperity following the disastrous Panic 
of 187
3, and the enormous ﬁ
nancial support the Republican Party re
-ceived from business, Garﬁ
eld wo
n an extremely close election by an 
electoral count of 
214
 to 155. He was the ﬁ
rst candidate to go directly 
from the 
House of Representatives to the White  House. The Green
-back candidate polled a little over 
300
,000 popular votes, and the 
Prohibitionist got 
10,000. Hancock carried the “solid South,” some
-thing the Demo
cr
atic candidates would enjoy for nearly 
100
 years. 
Unquestionably, the “solid South” was created through intimidation 
177 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
and various discriminatory laws regarding suffrage by which southern 
states effectively nulliﬁ
ed the Fifteenth Amendment with respect to 
voting by African-Americans. But this election proved that the Re
-publicans could win the White  
Ho
use without southern support. 
After his inauguration in March 
1881
, Ga
rﬁ
eld clashed repeatedly 
with the Stalwart faction of his party over distributing the patronage. 

And he infuriated them further by appointing James G. Blaine his 

secretary of state. Several months later, on June 
2, 1881
, the President 
was shot by a disgruntled and unstable  
ofﬁ
 ce-seeker, Charles J. Gui
-teau, who wanted Garﬁ
eld replaced by Arthur as President, an action 

th
at went a long way in destroying the Stalwart faction. Garﬁ
 eld lin
-gered for two months before dying on September 
19. As a result of the assassination, and with President Arthur’s strong 
endor
sement, Congress passed the Civil Ser
vice Reform Act on Janu
-ary 
16, 1883,
 which established a permanent  
three-
man Civil Ser
vice 
Commission to conduct competitive examinations and make appoint
-ments based on merit. This had been one of the urgent demands by 

refo
rmers who felt that the patronage system was thoroughly corrupt 
and detrimental to the public good. During Arthur’s term of ofﬁ
 ce, 
something like 
14,000 out of 
100
,000 government positions 
were ﬁ lled 
by civil ser
vice examinations. It was an admirable beginning, but fur
-ther reform of the civil ser
vi
ce was necessary if the patronage system 
was ever to be completely controlled. Some in
de pen
dent Republicans 
felt that further reform preceded all other issues, and they 
were called 
Mugwumps because they 
were seen as 
fence-
sitters with their mugs on 
one side of the po
liti
cal fence and their wumps on the other. Three of 
the more prominent Mugwumps  
were Carl Schurz, Charles Francis 
Adams, and E. L. Godkin. 
In a ddition to 
the Greenback and Prohibition movements during 
th
e Gilded Age, a group known as the Patrons of Husbandry, or 
Grangers as they 
were more popularly known, developed, as early as 
1867
. It was a secret society that at ﬁ
rst sought to advance the interests 
of the farmer. It was or
ganized in Washington and called for action 

against monopolies because they prevented competition and the estab
-lishment of maximum railroad rates for shipping goods and charging 
178 
a short history of the united states 
passenger fees. Members were particularly angry over the rates charged 
by th
e railroads. The movement soon spread to the Midwest under the 
leadership of Ignatius Donnelly. Illinois was the ﬁ
rst state to enact leg
-islation that created a commission to set maximum rates to be charged 

by ra
ilroads and ware 
houses. Wisconsin and Iowa followed by enacting 
laws which maximized railroad freight rates. These Granger laws 
were immediately challenged in the courts, but the Supreme Court upheld 

them in 
Munn v. Illinois
 in 1877
, arguing that they were within a state’s 
police power to protect the public interest. It said that the way to ap
-
peal was through the polls, not through the courts. 
As a further measure to unravel the effects of Reconstruction, south
-ern states began to enact Jim Crow laws. Tennessee passed the ﬁ
 rst such 
law in 
1881
, when it segregated railroad coaches, followed by Florida 
in 1887
, Texas in 
1889
, and Louisiana in 
1890
. Again appeals reached 
the Supreme Court, which in 
1896
 upheld these state laws in the case 
Plessy v. Ferguson
, so long, the Court said, as equal accommodations 
existed. 
The rise of monopolies and trusts to eliminate competition was an
-other important development during the Gilded Age. In 
188
2, the 
Standard Oil Company formed a trust with a number of other oil pro
-ducers and reﬁ
ne
rs to create a company that controlled ninety percent 
of all the oil produced and reﬁ
ned in the United States. Investment 
bankers ﬁ
nanced consolidations in railroads, utilities, and other indus
-trial enterprises. The number of these trusts that 
were ch
artered by the 
states reached nearly 
300
, with investments ranging close to $
250 mil
-lion. The perpetrators of this rapaciousness won the inelegant title 

“R
obber Barons,” and these moguls used their money to control legis
-lators and legislation, especially anything that would regulate or con
-trol their operations. The use of lobbyists to corrupt congressmen 

be
came more extensive. They 
were journalists and former congressmen 
who hovered around the Capitol building like “birds of prey.” They 

also included women who  
were widows or daughters of former con
-gressmen and could not be “shaken off as readily.” 
States with farming communities also witnessed heightened po
liti
cal activity to gain advantages denied them because of the growing number 

of business monopolies. Alliances 
were formed to protect farmers 
against railroads, industrial monopolies, and advocates of hard money 
179 Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
(specie). Two of the more important regional groups  were the Southern 
Alliance and the National Farmers’ Alliance of the Northwest. 
But monopolies and trusts  
were no
t the only problem. Corruption 
seemed to seep into every conceivable activity involving money, and it 

took a variety of forms. Po
liti
cal machines in the cities chose candi
-dates for ofﬁce who would perform as directed, and these machines 

th
en rigged the elections. As more and more immigrants crowded into 
the cities, they became easy targets not only for politi
cal bosses seeking 
to build mass electorates, but also for industrial tycoons who operated 

sweatshops and rarely paid a living wage. 
In Congress there was continual disagreement over which issues and 
refo
rms needed to be addressed, and which should take priority. At 
ﬁrst their main concerns involved hard money versus soft money, and 
tariff protection. Among themselves, Demo
crats often divided over 
tariff reform, most of them favoring a tariff for revenue, not for protec
-tion, but some, like those in Pennsylvania, argued in favor of protection. 

Th
e Republicans split over civil ser
vice reform, and the Mugwumps 
took offense when the Republican National Convention nominated 

Blaine for President in 
1884
 and John A. Logan of Illinois for Vice 
President. The Mugwumps did not believe that Blaine would support 

reform. Worse, he was tainted with corruption involving a railroad. So 

they supported the Demo
cratic candidate, Grover Cleveland, a reform 
mayor of Buffalo and former governor of New York, along with Thomas 

A. 
Hendricks of Indiana. In a hotly contested campaign both candi
-dates  were viliﬁ
ed: Blaine because he had allegedly lied about his in
-volvement in the railroad  
sc
andal—“Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, 
the Continental Liar from the State of Maine,” sang  
Democrats—and 
Cleveland because he had allegedly fathered an illegitimate child: “Ma, 

Ma, Where’s My Pa? Gone to the White  
House, ha, ha, ha,” laughed 
the Republicans. 
But what really damaged Blaine in this contest was a remark by the 
Re
verend Samuel D. Burchard that the Demo
cratic Party was a party 
of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The remark was made in a New 

York hotel room in Blaine’s presence, and he failed to disavow it. New 

York ’s vast number of 
Irish-
American Catholics took offense, and he 
lost many pop 
ular votes. Cleveland won 
219
 electoral votes to Blaine’s 
182
, becoming the ﬁ
 rst Demo
cratic President since James Buchanan. 
180 
a short history of the united states 
As corruption mounted and monopolies abounded, the electorate 
beca
me more vocal in their demands for governmental action. The 
farmers constantly complained about railroad abuses, such as discrimi
-natory rates and rebates. Their alliances threatened retaliation at the 
po
lls, and their complaints eventually resulted in a congressional probe 
that ﬁ
nally produced federal regulation of interstate commerce. In 
1887 
Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act, which prohibited 

discriminatory rates by railroads, rebates, and a higher charge for a 

short haul than for a longer one. Railroads  were required to post their 

rates and not change them without giving advance notice. The act also 

established a  
ﬁ ve-member Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), 
the nation’s ﬁ
rst regulatory agency. Still, the cleverness of railroad law
-yers in ﬁ
 nding loopholes in the law, combined with the skill of lobby
-ists and the favorable decisions toward railroads by the Supreme Court, 
al
l but rendered the ICC powerless in its attempts to curb abuses. 
Manufacturers not only sided with the railroads but employed lob
-byists and contributed to po
liti
cal campaigns to win greater protection 
of their products from foreign competition. And Republicans responded 

favorably. Year after year the tariff rates  were raised, bringing the gov
-ernment greater revenue and a mounting surplus that encouraged larger 

po
rk barrels. President Cleveland pleaded for tariff reduction, but he 
succeeded only in alienating some members of his own party, especially 

those from Pennsylvania. What he did achieve was a new record in the 

number of vetoes he issued, a total of 
414, mostly dealing with pen
-sions, at least a fourth of which  
were pr
obably fraudulent. All of Cleve-
land’s pre
deces sors vetoed only 
205
 bills. He more than doubled that 
number. 
Cleveland’s position on the tariff and his vetoes provided the Re
-publicans with adequate ammunition to attack his record of four years 

an
d bring about his defeat in the presidential election of 
1888
. The Re
-publicans put forward Benjamin Harrison of Indiana (the grandson of 

Wi
lliam Henry Harrison) and Levi P. Morton of New York. Cleve
-land lost a great many pop 
ul
ar votes when a letter by the British minis
-ter to the United States, Sir Lionel  
Sack
ville-
West, advised a naturalized 
Englishman (a California Republican, as it turned out) to vote for 
Cleveland. The letter was subsequently published. This apparent for
-eign intrusion into American affairs outraged many voters, especially 
181 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
Irish-
Americans. Harrison took 
233 electoral votes to Cleveland’s 
168
. But the pop 
ular vote proved far different: 
5,540
,000 for Cleveland to 
5,440
,000 for Harrison. 
Traditionally, Republicans supported 
hig
her tariff rates 
while the Demo
crats felt the rates needed to be lowered, especially 
since the surplus was getting out of hand. With Thomas Brackett 
Reed as Speaker, a man who exercised tight control on the proceedings 

in the  
House of 
Representatives— in fact he introduced new rules to 
force the  
House to attend to business and was dubbed “Czar” Reed by 
Democrats—the Republicans rammed a bill through the lower cham
-ber that raised duties on virtually every import that competed with 

Am
erican products. On average the rates jumped by 
49.5 percent. 
William McKinley of Ohio, the chairman of the Ways and Means 

Committee, introduced the mea 
sure. He was a staunch advocate of 
protection and a man of principle who was an excellent speaker and a 

congenial colleague. He was a favorite among Republicans. The bill 

passed by a vote of 
164
 to 142, but it ran into stiff opposition in the Sen
-ate, and western senators promised to defeat it unless a more acceptable 

coi
nage bill, allowing for the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the 
ratio of sixteen to one with gold, was passed. And southern senators 

threatened to join their western colleagues if a  
House-
approved Federal 
Election Bill, or Force Bill, as they called it, was enacted. This mea
sure 
was intended to protect black voters in the South by providing federal 

supervision of federal elections. It speciﬁ
 ed that when 
100
 voters in any 
district applied for an investigation, federal ofﬁ
cials would inspect and 
verify or question the results. 
Fearful that the McKinley tariff would fail, the leadership of the 
Republican Party jettisoned the Force Bill and suggested a compromise 
on silver. What became the Sherman Silver Purchase Act found favor 

with the western senators because it required the Trea
sury to purchase 

4.5 million ounces of silver each month at the market price, which was 
mo
re than double the amount bought under the  
Bland-
Allison Act, 
and pay for it with legal tender notes redeemable in specie (gold or sil
-ver). It was estimated that the amount to be purchased was approxi
-mately the total U.S. production of silver. This legislation was passed 
182 
a short history of the united states 
on July 
4, 1890
, whereupon the Senate approved the McKinley Tariff 
Act and President Harrison signed it on October 
1. Naturally, manu
-facturers raised the prices on their products without fear of being un
-dercut by foreign competition. It did not take long for the tariff to be 
seen as
 a tax on the poor to beneﬁ
t rich industries. 
This bill also included an interesting provision that allowed the 
Presi
dent to raise duties without obtaining congressional approval, in 
order to encourage reciprocal tariff agreements with foreign nations. 

This was an important surrender by Congress of one of its most jeal
-ously guarded  
pr
erogatives: the power to levy taxes and control the 
purse strings. 
An even more important piece of legislation was passage of the 
Sher
man  
Anti-
Trust Act. The need to curb and control the prolifera
-tion of monopolies in basic industries, such as oil, sugar, and beef, had 

fo
r many years been demanded by reformers and those who recognized 
that the elimination of competition hindered the formation of small 

and  
middle- 
size companies. It also meant higher prices for the con
-sumer, and that struck hardest at 
mid
dle-
class people and the poor. 
Public concern about the growth of monopolies had already prompted 

twenty states and territories of the United States to pass antitrust legis
-lation. But to really get a handle on the problem required federal ac
-tion. Although the Republican Party generally opposed such legislation, 

it saw t
he need to accede to pop 
ular demand, and in July 
1890
, it passed 
the Sherman  
Anti-
Trust Act, whereby “every contract, combination in 
the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade . . . is 

hereby declared to be illegal.” 
But this act was inherently weak. It was ambiguous. It failed to de
-ﬁne the meaning of such words as “trust,” “restraint,” and “combina
-tion.” And was unclear whether  
un
ions and railroads  
were covered by 
this legislation. Thus, the act was not vigorously enforced, and mo
-
nopolies continued to grow under other names. 
The record of achievement by this Congress in passing 
641
 bills, 
many of which  
were important, came as something of a shock to the 
American people when it learned that $
1 billion had been appropriated. 
A billion dollars! It struck many as unbelievable. They therefore de
-
manded an explanation of this “Billion-
Dol
lar Congress.” Speaker 
Reed supposedly responded: “It is a  
billion-
dollar country.” 
183 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
That explanation hardly satisﬁ
ed the electorate, who showed their 
dis
plea
sure by voting Demo
crats back into ofﬁ
ce. The Demo
crats now 
held a majority in the  
House of Representatives, although the Senate 
remained under Republican control because of the many holdovers 
who  
were not up for reelection. The unpopularity of the McKinley 
Tariff was especially signiﬁ
cant in understanding the size of the Re
-publican defeat. Indeed, McKinley himself lost his bid for reelection 

in 1890
. The bi t t e r n e ss m a n y 
Am
ericans felt about the direction of the 
country was reﬂ
ected in a number of violent incidents that occurred 
within a few years. For example, the Haymarket Massacre in Chicago 

in May 
1886
 occurred when agitation over conditions of labor in the 
city ended in clashes with the police that resulted in the hanging of 

four anarchist labor leaders. This episode was followed by a violent 

strike at the Carnegie steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania, in July 

1892; and by an equally violent strike in Illinois in 
1894
, called when 
George Pullman, the inventor of the Pullman railroad car, discharged 

one-
third of his workforce and cut salaries. It took the intervention of 
federal forces to bring the violence and these strikes to an end. Obvi
-ously, the growing economic distress among the laboring poor had in
-creased to the point where they resorted to violence as the only way to 

make the nation and the government aware of the terrible conditions 
that existed, especially in the cities. Labor 
unions such as the Ameri
-can Federation of Labor or
ga
nized many of these outbursts to publicize 
the wretched working conditions in industry. 
Agriculture, too, suffered an economic turndown in the 
1890
s, and 
farmers recognized that their concerns mirrored the problems of labor 

and that they needed to unite to get them resolved. Representatives 

from the farmers’ alliances met in St. Louis in December 
1889
 with 
leaders of the labor  
unions and the Granger and Greenback organiza
-tions, to form the People’s Party, better known as the Populist Party. 

Th
is party held its ﬁ
rst national nominating convention in Omaha, 
Nebraska, in July 
1892, with such leaders as Ignatius Donnelly, “Sock
-less Jerry” Simpson, Mary Elizabeth Lease, and Senator James Kyle of 

So
uth Dakota in attendance. They nominated James Weaver of Iowa 
184 
a short history of the united states 
for President, and James G. Field of Virginia for Vice President. Their 
pl
atform called for the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of 
sixteen to one, government ownership of all transportation and com
-munication facilities, a graduated income tax, the direct election of 

se
nators, adoption of a secret ballot, a shorter day for industrial workers, 
and the right to effect legislation through initiative and referendum 

procedures. 
The cruel social and economic injustices that developed at the close 
of
 the nineteenth century not only forced ordinary people to band to
-gether to form the People’s Party but, a few years later, initiate the 

Prog
ressive movement. A wide spectrum of people in all sections of the 
country now shouted their demand for better working conditions in
-volving hours and wages, woman and child labor laws, and strict codes 

to p
rotect the health and safety of workers in factories. These economic 
demands emphasized the fact that the United States had become a na
-tion divided by class on the basis of wealth. 
In the presidential election of 
1892 th
e Demo
crats once more put 
forward Grover Cleveland for President and Adlai Stevenson of Illi
-nois for Vice President while the Republicans nominated Harrison for 

a secon
d term, along with Whitelaw Reid of New York. There  were 
also a Socialist ticket and a Prohibition ticket in this election. But 

Cleveland won over 
5.5 million pop
ular and 
277
 electoral votes to Har-
rison’s 
5 million pop
ular and 
145
 electoral votes. The Populist candi
-date, Weaver, garnered over a million pop 
ular
 and 
22 electoral votes. 
His party also won eight seats in the  House of Representatives. And 

for the ﬁ
rst time since the Civil War, the Demo
cratic Party controlled 
both 
houses of Congress and the presidency. 
But no sooner had the Demo
cr
ats taken over the government than a 
ﬁnancial panic hit the country, and it hit hard. Triggered by a run on 
gold reserves by the British banking  
house of Baring Brothers in un
-loading American securities, by the McKinley Tariff, which reduced 

U.S.
 revenues; and by the depletion of the government’s surplus through 

th
e many pensions awarded to Civil War veterans, widows, and or
-phans by the Harrison administration, the Panic struck in May 
1893
, when the stock market crashed. Five hundred banks collapsed, hun
-dreds of businesses failed, and unemployment soared. By the end of the 

year t
he gold reserve had plunged to $
80 million. 
185 
Reconstruction and the Gilded Age  
To stanch the hemorrhage of gold, Cleveland called Congress into 
special session and asked for the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase 
Act. Congress agreed and acted quickly. But the hemorrhaging contin
-ued and the depression got worse. An “army” of unemployed workers, 

led by Jacob S. C
oxey of Ohio, a Populist, marched on Washington 
and demanded jobs and an increase in the money supply. Coxey and 

several other leaders  
were arrested and Coxey’s army was forced to dis
-band. 
The Democrats in the  
Ho
use succeeded in reducing the tariff, but 
the Senate added 
634
 amendments which jacked rates back up. This 
Wilson-
Gorman Tariff passed on August 
27, 1894
, but Cleveland re
-fused to sign it. One important feature of the act was a two percent ﬂ
 at ra
te on personal and corporate income over $
4,000. But the Supreme 
Court, in the case of 
Pollock v. Farmers Loan and Trust Company
, de-clared this provision unconstitutional because it was a direct tax, and 

di
rect taxes can be apportioned only according to the population of 
each state. 
To resolve the problem of the continued depletion of the gold re
-serve, the administration worked out a $
62 mi
llion loan from a bank
-ing group headed by J. Pierpont Morgan and August Belmont whereby 

3.5 million ounces of gold would be purchased with government bonds, 
hal
f the gold to come from abroad. For their assistance, the bankers 
raked in a proﬁ
t of $
1.5 million. 
Maintaining the gold standard became an important issue in the 
pr
esidential election of 
1896
, although the depression and the fact that 
it persisted throughout the Cleveland administration did not bode well 

for the Demo
crats. Under the dexterous management by Marcus A. 
Hanna, a Cleveland mining and shipping magnate, the Republican 

Party nominated William McKinley for President at its convention in 

St. Louis in 
mid-
June and Garret A. Hobart of New Jersey for Vice 
President on a platform that advocated the single gold standard, a high 

protective tariff, and an aggressive foreign policy. 
At their convention in Chicago on July 
8, the Demo
crats adopted a 
platform that demanded the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the 

ratio of sixteen to one, and an end to high protective tariffs and the use 

of injunctions against labor. William Jennings Bryan gave an electrify
-ing speech at the convention, in which he answered the Republican call 
186 
a short history of the united states 
for a gold standard “by saying to them: You shall not press upon the 
br
ow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon 
a cross of gold.” And that speech won him the nomination for Presi
-dent. Arthur Sewall of Maine was nominated for Vice President. The 

pl
atform also condemned the Supreme Court’s ruling against the in
-come tax. 
The campaign was a “Battle of Standards,” that is, the gold versus 
th
e silver standard. The Populist Party endorsed Bryan but nominated 
the ﬁ
ery Thomas E. Watson of Georgia for Vice President. Its failure 
to put forward its own candidate for President demoralized the mem
-bers, and it ceased to function thereafter as a viable party. 
Although Bryan traveled around the country giving mesmerizing 
sp
eeches to enthusiastic crowds in 
twenty-
nine states, he lost the elec
-tion to the superbly managed and  
well
-ﬁnanced Republican or
ganiza-tion run by Marcus Hanna. McKinley conducted his campaign from 

th
e front porch of his home in Canton, Ohio. At Hanna’s call, indus
-trialists contributed around $
16 mi
llion to the campaign, which was 
used to portray Bryan as a radical who would destroy the government’s 

fundamental institutions. McKinley captured 
271
 electoral votes to 
Bryan’s 
176
. In the pop 
ular vote McKinley won over 
7 million to Bry-
an’s 
6.5 million. 
Both 
houses of Congress remained in Republican hands. A new era 
was about to begin and would reshape the course of American politics. 
7Manifest Destiny,
Pr
ogressivism, War, and the 
Roaring Twenties
A s the united
 States experienced the rapid growth of business 
and the accumulation of wealth, it recognized that it had come a 
long way in a relatively short period of time. Prior to the Civil War 

there  
were few great fortunes. Most industries 
were small, although 
there was growth throughout the antebellum period. Indeed, a few 

men made enough money so that a new word had to be devised to de
-scribe them. “Millionaire” was the word, and it applied to such men as 

Jo
hn Jacob Astor, for example, who built his fortune from fur trading. 
But the great business boom resulting from the Civil War revolution
-ized the size, methods, and marketing of industrial enterprises. The rise 

of
 big business in the United States produced giant companies in the 
making of steel and the reﬁning of oil and sugar. Even farming became 

mechanized with the invention of the McCormick reaper. Such inven
-tions as the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 
1876
, th
e electric 
lightbulb by  Thomas Edison in 
1879
, the linotype machine by Ottmar 
Mergentheber in 
1886,
 and many others created entirely new companies. 
As mentioned earlier, railroads, which had ﬁ
rst appeared in the 
1820
s, now stretched across the continent. By 
1900
 there 
were several hundred 
thousand miles of railroad track  
connecting urban centers with remote 
towns and villages. And, as the economic historian Alfred D. Chandler 
188 
a short history of the united states 
Jr., has shown, this expanded railroad system required professional man
-agers, engineers, and other specialists to provide for its construction and 
mai
ntenance, as well as the billing, collection, the preparation of timeta
-bles, and other ser
vi
ces. Consequently, a new class of managerial profes
-sionals had arisen, enabling railroad companies to expand rapidly in size 

and
 productivity. 
What happened with 
ra
ilroading—that is, the appearance of mana
-gerial 
professionals—soon spread to other industries. The robber bar
-ons, obsessed with maximizing their proﬁ
ts, set abou
t converting to a 
managerial form of capitalism by which they could better dominate 

their industry and form monopolies to maintain control. Branches of a 

par
tic 
ular company would be established in various sections of the 
country, directed by professional managers who supervised thousands 

of workers and salesmen. Some of these robber barons, such as John D. 

Rocke
fel
ler and Andrew Carnegie, earned so much money that they 
set up foundations to give it away. Without an income tax, many of 

them became billionaires. 
Because of the enormous wealth generated by the expansion of big 
business, the United States became more conscious of its increased power 
in the 
world—not that it wished to involve itself with the problems of 
foreign nations or exert any inﬂ
uence in world affairs. Isolationism 
seemed to provide many people with a sense of security by simply follow
-ing a policy of neutrality ﬁ
rs
t enunciated by President George Washing
-ton. Still, there lurked the pride of knowing that Americans’ “experiment 

in f
reedom,” resulting from a republican form of government, could be 
attractive to other nations and imitated. If other countries wished to 

achieve what the United States had acquired in terms of wealth and 

power they need only convert from monarchy to democracy. Americans 

had a desire to see their “experiment” take root across the globe and, 

when necessary, to assist it themselves by direct or indirect action. 
The progress of 
the United States seemed miraculous. Its steady, 
unrelenting development began with the arrival of Eu
ropeans searching 
for land and with their conquest of a wilderness teeming with native 
tribes. After the Revolution and the establishment of a uniﬁ
 ed govern
-ment under the Constitution, the United States continued its westward 
Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
189 expansion with the purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 
180
3, followed 
by the acquisition of Florida in 
1821
, the acquisition of Texas in 
1845
, and 
the seizure of territories from Mexico following the Mexican War in 
1848
, including the Gadsden Purchase in 
1853
, when the United States 
paid “conscience money” of $
10 million for a strip of land south of the Gila 
River in Arizona and New Mexico that had been seized four years ear
-lier. Then, in 
1867
, William Seward, secretary of state under Presidents 
Lincoln and Johnson, negotiated a treaty with Rus sia by which Alaska 

was acquired for $
7.2 million. To all these acquisitions there was spirited 
opposition: Federalists denounced the Louisiana Purchase as unconsti
-tutional, Jackson was denounced for his seizure of Florida, Whigs fulmi
-nated against war with Mexico, and Seward suffered personal abuse for 

th
e outrageous cost of Alaska. The acquisition of Alaska was called 
“Seward’s Folly.” But the discovery of gold and later oil and gas more 

than justiﬁ
ed the purchase of Alaska as far as cost was concerned. 
The physical expansion of the nation continued with the annexation 
of t
he Hawaiian Islands in July 
1898. American missionaries, mer
-chants, and planters had established economic and cultural ties with 

th
e islands starting in the 
1830
s. But in a successful revolt Americans 
deposed the reigning monarch, Queen Liliuokalani, in 
1893
 and erected 
a government that lasted until Congress, during the McKinley admin
-istration in 
1898, pas
sed a joint resolution annexing the islands, de
-spite the strong opposition of 
anti
-imperialists in both the Republican 
and the Demo
cratic parties. One of the great attractions in possessing 
these islands, aside from their being a lucrative market and a source of 

exotic fruits, such as the pineapple, was the fact that they provided re
-fueling bases and naval facilities for the United States at a time when it 

wa
s continuing to reach across the seas and bring its supposedly en
-lightened system of government to a needy and eager world. Two years 

la
ter Congress granted Hawaii territorial status. 
By the end of the nineteenth century the United States had such a 
co
ngratulatory sense of its success in developing an industrial society 
committed to individual freedom and demo 
cratic rule, combined with its 
genuine humanitarian regard for the suffering of those living under im
-poverished conditions and dictatorial rule, that it slowly renewed its be
-lief in its mission to spread freedom and democracy around the globe. 

Th
is was Manifest Destiny revisited. The idea was ﬁ
rst enunciated in 
190 
a short history of the united states 
1845
 by John L. O’Sullivan, editor of the
 Demo cratic Review
, who said 
that “Providence” had chosen this country “by the right of our manifest 
destiny” to spearhead a drive throughout the entire North American 

continent for “the development of the great experiment of liberty and 

federative self government entrusted to us.” What had begun as an argu
-ment “to overspread and possess” the continent had now become a global 

mis
sion, at least with regard to disseminating the blessings of liberty and 
democracy. The nation forgot the warning of John Quincy Adams, who 

had declared that the United States should be “the 
well-
wisher to the 
freedom and in
de pen
dence of all” nations but that it must not go “abroad 
in search of monsters to destroy.” To do so would inaugurate America’s 

search for “dominion and power” in the world and would ultimately re
-sult in the loss of its own “freedom and inde 
pen
dence.” 
Disregarding this sage advice, the United States at the tail end of 
th
e nineteenth century, spotted its ﬁ
rst “monster to destroy”: Spain. 
Rebels in Cuba had initiated an insurrection against Spanish rule on 

the island in an effort to obtain their in
de pen
dence. This revolution 
had resulted in part because of a failed economy brought on by the tar
-iff policies of the United States, which had imposed heavy duties on 

raw sug
ar, the island’s principal export. Spain’s brutal response in 
crushing the rebellion evoked sympathetic outcries of protest from the 

United States. The horror stories of the treatment of Cuban civilians 

by Spanish  
ofﬁ
cials involving rape, assault, and  torture were just the 
sort of juicy material some American journalists loved to feed to a 

lurid-
hungry reading public in the United States. Such “yellow jour
-nalistic” newspapers (so called because of a cartoon titled the “Yellow 

Ki
d” that appeared in them) such as William Randolph Hearst’s 
New 
York Journal
 and Joseph Pulitzer’s 
New York World
 published detailed 
accounts of alleged Spanish depredations committed against Cuban 

nationals. These made for irresistible reading. As though responding to 

the public mood, Congress passed a concurrent resolution in February 

1896
 favoring recognition of Cuban belligerency. The situation heated 
up when, on February 
15, 1898, the USS 
Maine, on a visit to Havana, 
was sunk by an explosion in which 
260 ofﬁ
cers and sailors perished. 
The ﬁ
nger of guilt was pointed directly at Spanish ofﬁ
 cials. Jingoists 
had a ﬁeld day trumpeting what the nation would do in 
retaliation—as 
Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
191 though proof of Spain’s guilt already existed. Growled one Congress
-man on the ﬂ
oor o
f the  
House of Representatives, “It ought to be un
-derstood in Spain and it ought to be understood in every country on 
th
e globe, that while this great country sincerely desires to be at peace, 
it is prepared for war, if war becomes necessary.” 
A reply from Spain about the sinking was eagerly awaited, but in 
Apr
il 
1898 Congress passed another resolution recognizing Cuban in-
de pen
dence and demanding the immediate withdrawal of Spanish 
authority from Cuba. The President was authorized to use military 

force to implement this resolution if necessary. The Teller Amend
-ment to the resolution stated that the United States had no intention 

of a
nnexing Cuba but would “leave the government and control of the 
island to its own people” once peace had been established. President 

McKinley signed the resolution on April 
20. Immediately, Spain broke 
off diplomatic relations with the United States, and on April 
24 de-clared war, whereupon Congress responded with its own declaration 

on
 April 
25. Most Americans felt a sense of honor and national pride, along with 
a desi
re to share the blessings of liberty and democracy, and so they ea
-gerly engaged in what came to be called “a splendid little war.” The 

Sp
anish-
American War provided the United States with a series of na
-val and land victories in Cuba as well as the Philippine Islands, another 

Span
ish possession. In May, Commodore George Dewey entered Ma
-nila Bay in the Philippines and completely destroyed what little Spanish 

navy w
as present to guard the islands. In Cuba some 
17,000 American 
troops descended on the island, the most prominent of which was one 

regiment, known as the Rough Riders, commanded by Col
onel Leon
-ard Wood and Lieutenant Col
on
el Theodore Roo se
velt, who had re
-signed as assistant secretary of the navy to participate in the invasion. 
Spain suffered one humiliating military disaster after another and 
lo
st an army and its ﬂ
 eet. A young, wealthy, powerful, emerging giant 
had provoked a poor, weak, decrepit ancient and brought it to its knees. 

Spain sued for peace in July, and a preliminary treaty was signed in 

Washington on August 
12. The ﬁ
nal peace treaty was negotiated in 
Paris on December 
10, 1898. Spain recognized Cuba’s in
de pen
dence and ceded Puerto Rico and Guam to the United States as a war in
-192 
a short history of the united states 
demnity. It also surrendered the Philippine Islands in return for $
20 mil
lion. 
President McKinley claimed that he had been troubled over what to 
do about t
he Philippines and had prayed for divine guidance. “I walked 
the ﬂ
 oor of the White  
House night after night until midnight,” he re
-membered. “I went down on my knees and prayed Almighty God for 
li
ght and guidance.” The answer came in the middle of the night: “that 
we could not give them back to 
Spain—that would be cowardly and 
dishonorable . . .  
that we could not leave them to 
themselves—they 
were unﬁt for  
self-
government . . .  
that there was nothing left for us to 
do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and 

civilize and Christianize them, and by God’s grace do the very best we 

could by them.” 
Uplift and civilize them! Even Christianize them, despite the fact 
th
at most “Filipinos”  were Roman Catholics. Bring them the blessings 
of Americanized freedom and democracy so that some day Filipinos 

would become wealthy and powerful. Any number of Americans actu
-ally believed it was their moral duty to bring an “enlightened society” 

to
 the benighted Filipinos, while certain business interests lusted after 
expanding trade with Asian countries as they looked westward to de
-
velop new markets. 
In demanding the Philippine Islands the United States had foolishly 
an
d needlessly embarked on an imperialistic course that not only di
-vided the nation po
liti
cally but set into motion forces that would later 
provoke a bloody war. By thrusting itself into Asian affairs, where it 

had little real interest or concern, the country courted  catastrophe—and 

it came on December 
7, 1941
, at Pearl Harbor. 
The decision of the United States to purchase the Philippines came 
as qu
ite a shock to the people of the islands, and they 
rose up in rebel
-lion. They had expected in
de pen
dence and now, under the leadership 
of Emilio Aguinaldo, they 
were prepared to ﬁ
ght to achieve it. Ameri
-can troops put down the insurrection, an action that contradicted ev
-erything this nation professed about liberty and democracy. President 

Mc
Kinley appointed a  
commission—headed by William Howard Taft, 
a federal circuit court 
judge—to establish a government in the Philip
-pines. It would take almost ﬁ
ft
y years before the Philippine people 
would achieve their freedom. In 
1916 the Jones Act provided  
self
-Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
193 government for the islands and promised early inde 
pen
dence. But it 
took several more de 
cades before that independence was granted. And 
in 1917 the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark 
for $25 million. 
The twentieth century 
began with several momentous events. 
First,
 on March 
14, the Currency or Gold Standard Act, by which 
gold—and only  
gold—became the standard unit of currency, was 
passed, thus marking the end of a  
two-
decade struggle to make silver 
equal to gold. Then the following November the nation reelected 

McKinley as President, along with Theodore Roo
sevelt as Vice Presi
-dent, a selection that Marcus Hanna, the skillful manager of the 
1896 
campaign, strongly opposed because of Roo 
sevelt’s reform record as 
governor of New York. The Demo
crats nominated William Jennings 
Bryan and Adlai E. Stevenson on a platform of 
anti-
imperialism, anti
-trust, and free silver. A Socialist Party nominated Eugene V. Debs of 

Ind
iana and Job Harriman of California. A Prohibition Party and a 
People’s Party also put forward candidates for the presidential ofﬁ
 ce. Less than a year later, on September 
6, 1901
, President McKinley 
was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, at the  
Pan-
American Expo
-sition in Buffalo, New York, and he died a week later, on September 
14. Th
e new President, Theodore Roo 
sevelt, tried to reassure the nation 
by promising to “continue, absolutely unbroken the policy of President 

McKinley,” but he was known to champion such progressive causes as 

child labor laws, food and drug regulation, conservation, railroad re
-form, and trust busting. A number of party leaders expressed concern 

about wha
t he might do as chief executive. “Now look,” exclaimed 
Marcus Hanna, “that damned cowboy is President of the United 

States.” 
Indeed, these leaders had good reason to feel concern. Populists and 
al
l manner of social reformers from the East and West joined Roo 
se-velt under the banner of what was called Progressivism, a movement 

forme
d to further pop
ular government and progressive legislation. 
They insisted that the nation needed labor laws regarding women and 

children, legislation regulating wages and hours, and statutes that 

deﬁned safety and health conditions in factories. Trusts and railroads 
194 
a short history of the united states 
were high on the list of what needed reform, along with certain busi
-ness practices known to violate ethical and moral standards. Of par
tic
-ular concern was the unrelenting drive of industries to form trusts. 
Using what he called the “bully pulpit,” that is, his position as chief 
ex
ecutive of the nation, Roo 
sevelt sought pop
ular approval of his cru
-sade against trusts. The formation of the U.S. Steel Company, the ﬁ
 rst 
billion-
dollar corporation in the country, and the Northern Securities 
Company, a railroad holding company, inaugurated Roo se
velt’s drive 
to bring an end to industrial abuses. Under prodding by the President 
to expedite federal prosecution of antitrust suits in federal courts, Con
-gress passed the Expedition Act on February 
11, 1903
, giving these suits 
precedence in circuit court proceedings. A few days later, on February 
14, 1903
, the Department of Labor and Commerce was established 
which included a Bureau of Corporations that had authority to investi
-gate and subpoena testimony on activities by corporations involved in 

in
terstate commerce. The Elkins Act of February 
19, 1903
, sought to 
eliminate rebates on freight charges and regulate shipping by railroads. 

And in 
1906
 the Hepburn Act reinforced the Interstate Commerce Act 
by granting it the authority to set maximum railroad rates. 
As a President committed to conservation, Roo 
sevelt p
ressured 
Congress to pass the Newlands Act, which directed the proceeds from 

the sale of arid and semiarid lands in the West to be used for the con
-struction of dams, irrigation, and other reclamation projects. This leg
-islation has been compared to the Homestead Act in shaping the 

de
velopment of the western region of the country. 
In foreign affairs, Roo 
sevelt dec
ided that the  
ever-
burgeoning inter
-ests of the United States necessitated playing a larger role in world 

ev
ents. He summed up his philosophy by what he said was an African 
proverb: “Speak softly and carry a big stick, and you will go far.” The 

destiny of America, as far as Roo 
sevelt was concerned, dictated that 
new opportunities should be explored to enhance the reputation, 

wealth, and prestige of this country. One way to do that was to achieve 

something which had been contemplated for many de cades and revived 

as a result of the  
Spanish-
American War, namely, the building of a 
canal that would link the Atlantic and Paciﬁ
 c oceans. 
Roosevelt encouraged Panama, then a province of the nation of Co
-lombia, to seek its freedom in order to allow the building of a canal 
Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
195 
across the Isthmus of Panama. When native Panamanians, aided by 
fo
reign promoters of a canal, 
rose up in rebellion in November 
1903
, American troops 
were used to block Colombia’s effort to crush the re
-bellion, and Roo 
sevelt w
as quick to recognize the in
de pen
dence of 
the new Panamanian republic. The  
Hay-
Bunau-
Varilla Treaty, signed 
on November 
10, 1903
, granted the United States control of a  
ten-
mile 
zone across the isthmus. The United States also agreed to guarantee 

the in
de pen
dence of Panama. Furthermore, it obtained the right to 
intervene at any time to protect the sovereignty of this new Republic, 

and it agreed to pay $
10 million and an annual fee of $
250,000 to oper
-ate a canal after it had been built. 
Manifest Destiny had now moved south across the border. Army 
engi
neers under Col
onel William C. Gorgas set to work on the canal, 
and on January 
7, 1914
, the ﬁ
rst ship passed through it. Later, Roo se
velt 
would boast, “I took the Canal Zone.” The canal not only aided world 

trade but provided a vital means by which the United States could 

move its ﬂ
eet to protect its Paciﬁ
c and Asian possessions. Much later, 
during the administration of President Jimmy Carter in 
1977
, treaties 
were negotiated by which the United States would continue to operate 

the canal until the year 
2000
, after which own
ership of it would be 
turned over to Panama. with the understanding that its neutrality 

would be guaranteed even during periods of war. 
Once Roo
sevelt won 
election as President in 
1904
 against the 
Demo
crat Alton B. Parker, the Socialist Eugene Debs, the Prohibi
-tionist Silas C. Swallow, and the Populist Thomas E. Watson, he felt 
mo
re comfortable about urging additional social and economic re
-forms. In his ﬁ
rst m
essage to Congress, after his election on November 
4, he proposed several mea
sures regarding child labor, slum clearance, 
and the strengthening of investigative agencies. These proposals re
-sulted in some of the most important legislation of his administration, 

st
arting with the Pure Food and Drug Act, passed on June 
30, 1906
. This mea
sure forbade the manufacture, sale, and distribution of adul
-terated drugs and food in interstate commerce, and it prohibited fraud
-ulent labeling of these products. Congress also enacted the Meat 

Inspec
tion Act, but it took the publication of Upton Sinclair’s book 
The 196 
a short history of the united states 
Jungle
 to expose the ﬁ
 lthy conditions in meatpacking  
houses and neu
-tralize opposition to its passage. The law required sanitary conditions 
an
d federal inspection of meatpacking facilities in any operation in
-volved in interstate commerce. 
To a very large extent the President’s efforts reﬂ
ect
ed a larger Pro
-gressive movement that had developed within the country which de
-manded an end to the abuses of greedy corporations and machine 

po
litics. Several states had already initiated such reforms by requiring 
more accountability from business, and by returning government to the 

electorate. Wisconsin, for example, enacted railroad legislation and an 

income tax during the governorship of Robert M. La Follette. Other 

states joined the push toward progressivism, by adopting the direct 

primary and the initiative and referendum to allow voters a greater 

voice in deciding legislation. To a large extent the movement was ad
-vanced by a number of writers, such as Sinclair, Ida Tarbell, Henry 

Demarest Lloyd, Lincoln Stephens, and David Graham Phillips, who 
exposed corruption and greed in business and in both state and na
-tional politics. Magazines, including 
Cos
mopolitan
, McClure’s
, and the 
American
, which had national circulation, published their reports, and 
these stories became more and more sensational as they delved deeper 

into the activities of such monopolies as the Standard Oil Company, 

the beef trust, and the Chicago stockyards, as well as corruption in city 

governments and the United States Senate. Roo se
velt called them 
“muckrakers,” comparing them to the man with the muckrake in John 

Bunyan’s 
Pilgrim’s Progress
, who never sees what is around him because 
he is forever looking down at the ﬁ
lth he is raking. 
The Progressive movement was an important development in the 
evolution of American democracy. It urged legislation that would allow 
the electorate to have a voice in initiating legislature that would beneﬁ
 t them; it urged legislation that would permit the public to approve or 

disapprove mea
sures passed by state legislatures; and it urged legisla
-tion that would permit voters to recall elected ofﬁ
ci
als who, for one 
reason or another, did not serve the public  
well-
being. The electorate 
did not always take advantage of the proposed reforms, however. In
-deed, compared with citizens of other democracies around the world, 

Am
ericans have a poor record of exercising their voting rights. The 
percentage of qualiﬁ
ed men and women who regularly go to the polls 
Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
197 
rarely exceeds a little more than ﬁ
ft
y percent, compared to eighty and 
ninety percent in other countries. 
During the ﬁ
 rst 
ﬁfteen years of the twentieth century, many of 
these reforms  
were put forward as part of the platforms of the various 
politi
cal parties: Demo
cratic, Republican, Populist, Socialist, Social
-ist Labor, Progressive, Prohibition, In
de pen
dence, and United Chris
-tian. In 
1908
, Roo sevelt stepped  aside—he could have run for another 
term but chose to abide by the example of George Washington by 
serving only two  
terms—and recommended William Howard Taft to 
succeed him as President. Taft, with a platform that called for stricter 

enforcement of the antitrust laws and further tariff protection, de
-
feated William Jennings Bryan. The  
Mann
-Elkins Act, passed on 
June 
18, 1909
, added telephone, telegraph, and cable companies to the 
jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and per
-mitted it to suspend rate increases or to reduce rates if necessary, sub
-ject to judicial review. 
Republicans also passed the  
Pa
yne-
Aldrich Tariff Act of 
1909
, which raised duties to an average forty percent ad valorum, which Taft 

signed, declaring it “the best tariff bill the Republican party ever 

passed.” A number of Insurgent Republicans sharply disagreed and 

joined Demo
cratic efforts to reduce the tariff, but Taft vetoed those 
efforts. On January 
21, 1911
, these Insurgents formed the National Pro
-gressive Republican League in Washington, under the direction of 

Se
nator Robert M. La Follette, and demanded that the Republican 
Party directly support progressive legislation, such as the direct elec
-tion of senators; the initiative, referendum, and recall reforms by the 

stat
es; direct election of delegates to the national nominating conven
-tion; and direct primaries for the nomination of elective ofﬁ
 cers. 
Stal
-wart Republicans resisted these demands and renominated Taft for 

Presi
dent in 
1912
. Insurgent Republicans in the  
Ho
use of Representatives, led by Rep
-resentative George W. Norris of Nebraska, stripped Speaker Joseph 

Ca
nnon of his dictatorial powers in controlling legislation. They also 
faulted Taft for failing to support and defend the conservationist views 

of his pre 
deces sor. When Theodore Roo 
sevelt returned from a hunting 
trip to Africa, he broke with Taft, who he felt had betrayed his policies, 

and expounded on what he called the “new nationalism,” which sup
-198 
a short history of the united states 
ported an income tax, workmen’s compensation, labor laws for women 
an
d children, and stricter regulation of corporations. He then accepted 
the nomination of the Progressive Party in the election of 
1912
, declar
-ing that he felt as strong as a “Bull Moose.” 
After a long and difﬁ
cult struggle at the Demo
cr
atic convention 
held in Baltimore between the forces of Beauchamp (Champ) Clark of 

Missouri, Speaker of the  
House of Representatives, and Governor 
Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey, a former president of Princeton Uni
-versity, the delegates chose Wilson on the  
fort
y-sixth ballot with a 
platform supporting po
liti
cal and economic reform. Wilson himself 
put forward a program known as the “New Freedom.” It called for a 

reduced tariff, a reform of banking and currency, the strengthening of 

the Sherman  
Anti-
Trust Act, and the end of special privileges for busi
-ness that had been granted by the federal government. 
The election ended with the total triumph of the Demo
cra
ts. The 
Party swept to victory in forty states. Wilson won 
435
 electoral votes 
to 88 for Roo
sevelt and 
8 for Taft. He polled 
6,286
,214
 pop
ular votes 
to 4,126,020
 for Roo
sevelt and 
3,483
,922 for Taft. For the ﬁ
 rst time 
in American history, 
African-
Americans voted in large  numbers for 
Wilson because he had promised them fair treatment and greater  
police 
protection. He won the support of W. E. B. DuBois, who had founded 

the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 

(NAACP) in 
1909
 to aid black people in their quest for economic and 
social equality. The Demo
crats also won control of the  
House of Rep
-resentatives and elected more than two dozen governors, including 

several from traditionally Republican states, such as Massachusetts, 
Ohio, and New York. 
Clearly, the Progressive movement had profoundly affected the 
cour
se of American politics. It also helped bring about the passage in 
Congress of two important constitutional amendments: the Sixteenth, 

by which the income tax was legalized (it was adopted in February 

1913
); and the Seventeenth, which provided for the pop ular election of 
senators (and was ratiﬁ
ed in April 
1913
). One of the ﬁ
rst t
hings Wilson did on taking ofﬁ
ce was to call for the 
lowering of the tariff. He actually appeared before the members of 

Congress in giving his State of the  Union address, thus reviving a prac
-tice of Presidents Washington and Adams that had been discontinued 
Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
199 
by President Jefferson. Wilson informed the members that he wished to 
act a
s a partner in their legislative work, not as “a mere department of 
the Government hailing Congress from some isolated island of jealous 

power.” As a result the  
Underwood-
Simmons Tariff passed on October 
13, 1913
, which reduced rates on nearly 
1,000 items, including wool, 
sugar, iron ore, leather, hemp, wood, coal, and many foods. It also levied 

a one percent tax on incomes over $
2,000 with a $
1,000 exemption for 
married men, and a graduated tax from one to six percent on incomes 

from $
20,000 to $
500
,000. It was the ﬁ
rst such income tax under the 
recently ratiﬁ
ed Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution. 
Following an investigation by a Banking and Currency subcommit
-tee, chaired by Arsene Pujo of Louisiana, into the monopolistic prac
-tices of the banking establishment, the Federal Reserve Act was passed 

on December 
23, 1913
. It established twelve regional banks, each owned 
by private member banks and authorized to issue federal reserve notes 

to member banks. A Federal Reserve Board of seven members, ap
-pointed by the President with the consent of the Senate, controlled 

th
is decentralized system. The act also authorized the board to raise 
or lower the discount rate of member banks, thereby enabling the 

board to command the availability of credit throughout the nation. 
Two more pieces of Progressive legislation  were approved: the Clay
-ton Antitrust Act, passed on October 
15, 1914
, which strengthened the 
Sherman Antitrust Act by including practices not covered by the origi
-nal legislation; and the Federal Trade Commission Act, enacted on 

Sep
tember 
26, 1914
, which struck at business practices that were deemed 
to be unfair or in restraint of trade. 
To strengthen his support from farmers and thereby his bid for re
-election in 
1916, Wi
lson signed the Federal Farm Loan Act, which di
-vided the country into twelve districts, each having a Farm Loan bank 

th
at would provide farmers with 
long-
term,  
low-
interest credit. He 
also signed the  
Keating- 
Owen Child Labor Act in September 
1916 which forbade the sale in interstate commerce of any product made by 

children under the age of sixteen. 
A eu 
rope an w
a r 
had broken out in the summer of 
1914
, and the 
attention of the nation was abruptly turned to it when a German 
200 a short history of the united states 
submarine torpedoed the RMS 
Lusita
nia
 on May 
7, 1915
, and 
128 Amer
-ican lives  
were lo
st. Wilson protested the action, and when Germany 
announced its intention of attacking without warning all merchantmen 
found in the vicinity of the British Isles, Wilson cautioned Americans 

against doing anything that would violate the nation’s neutrality. In
-stead, he signed the National Defense Act, passed on June 
3, 1916, whi
ch expanded the regular army to 
175,000 and, over the next ﬁ
 ve years, increased its size to 
223
,000 and directed the enlargement of the 
National Guard to 
450
,000. It also established the Reserve Ofﬁ
 cers’ 
Training Corps at colleges and universities. 
In seeking reelection for Wilson, the Demo
cr
ats emphasized his 
desire to maintain peace. “He kept us out of war,” they contended. But 

the election of 
1916 proved to be a very close race. The Republicans put 
forward the Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who had 

once served as governor of New York. The Progressives tried to induce 

Roosevelt to run again, but he refused and urged his followers to sup
-port Hughes. Not until the results of the California vote came in was it 

cl
ear that Wilson had been reelected by an electoral count of 
277
 to 254 
for Hughes. The Demo
crats retained control of the Senate, but they 
lost the  
House. Still, the number of representatives of both major par
-ties was so close that Progressives and Inde 
pen
dents held the balance 
of power. With the support of In
de pen
dents, the Demo
crats  
were able 
to reelect Champ Clark as Speaker. 
One of the new members was Republican Jeannette Rankin of Mon
-tana, a  
thirty-
six-
year-
old suffragist and social worker. She said that 
she would represent everyone in her state but added that she felt “it was 

my special duty to express also the point of view of women and to make 

clear that the women of the country are coming to a full realization of 

the fact that Congress deals with their problems.” It should be remem
-bered that the Constitution had not yet been amended to grant the 

suf
frage to women, but Montana, like many other states, had already 
moved in this new, progressive, direction. Not until 
1918
 did both 
houses of Congress agree to a resolution providing women’s suffrage. 

This was the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which was 

ratiﬁ
ed on August 
26, 1920
. Rankin was also a dedicated paciﬁst and strongly opposed any ac
-tion that would involve the United States in the ongoing war in Eu
-Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
201 
rope. President Wilson hoped to bring about a conclusion to the war 
wi
thout victory for either side, one that would include an international 
organization dedicated to maintaining peace. But events took a sudden 
and unexpected turn. Early in 
1917
, Germany unleashed unrestricted sub
-marine warfare in an effort to bring the conﬂ
ic
t to a speedy conclusion, 
even though this risked involving the United States in the war. Subma
-rines would sink all ships, both neutral and hostile, without warning. 

Wi
lson immediately broke off diplomatic relations with Germany on 
February 
3, 1917
, and asked Congress for authority to arm merchant 
vessels. Congress agreed. At the same time the President revealed to 

the nation a tele 
gram intercepted by the British, written by Arthur 
Zimmermann, the German foreign secretary, to the German minister 

in Mexico in which it promised to return Texas, New Mexico, and 

Arizona to Mexico in the event of war between the United States and 

Germany—that is, if Mexico declared war against the United States. 
After the sinking of three American merchantmen by German 
submarines—in one of these sinkings, there was a heavy loss of Amer
-ican 
lives—Wilson summoned Congress to a special session on April 
2 and before a joint meeting of both 
houses asked for a declaration of 
war. It is a “fearful thing,” he said, “to lead this great peaceful people 

into war. . . .  
But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall 
ﬁ gh
t for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts.” 
After a heated debate the Senate approved the resolution on April 
4 by a vote of 
82 to 6. The  
House engaged in an even longer struggle, but 
on the morning of April 
6, by a vote of 
373
 to 50, it passed the declara
-tion, Jeannette Rankin voting against it. At 
1:18 PM
 the same day, 
Wilson signed the resolution and the United States entered World 

War I. 
One of the ﬁ
rst t
hings Congress did was pass the Selective Ser
vice 
Act on May 
18, 1917,
 which called for the registration for military ser
-vice of all men between the ages of eigh
teen a
nd  
forty-
ﬁve. Of the 
more than 
24 million men enrolled in the draft, almost 
3 million 
were called up for ser
vice. Congress also passed the Espionage and Sedition 
Acts in 
1917
 and 
1918
, establishing ﬁ
nes and imprisonment for those 
convicted of aiding the enemy or committing other disloyal acts. It 

gave the postmaster general the right to exclude from the mails any 

materials deemed seditious or treasonable. The constitutionality of this 
202 a short history of the united states 
mea
sure was upheld by the Supreme Court in 
1919 in the case 
Schenck 
v. United States
. The war effort at home developed through two stages: the ﬁ
 rst, 
from the outset of war to the end of 
1917
, relied principally on volunteer 
efforts; the second, from 
1918
 to the end of the conﬂ
ict, brought the 
administration into exercising full control. Using the authority pro
-vided by Congress, Wilson mobilized farmers and  
ho
usewives through 
the Food Administration program, headed by Herbert Hoover, widely 
recognized as an expert because of his success in directing the Belgium 

Relief Commission. The Food Administration succeeded in increasing 

the food supply so that it tripled the amount of food shipped overseas. 

Railroads  
were regulated, and Bernard Baruch headed a War Indus
-tries Board, which hastened the steady supply of equipment necessary 

to
 conduct the war. To pay for the war, which ultimately cost $
33.5 bil
-lion, income taxes on individuals and corporations  were increased to 

ap
proximately  
sixty-
ﬁve percent, excess proﬁ
t taxes  
were enacted, and 
estate taxes  
were increased. 
Not until the late spring of 
1918
 did the U.S. military forces, com
-manded by General John J. Pershing, join the Allied forces in France 

an
d take up a position just east of Verdun. Meanwhile the Germans 
had signed a harsh peace treaty with the new government of the Soviet 

Union, which had toppled the Romanov dynasty in Russia, executed 

the czar, and established a communist state. Then Germany launched 

an all-
out assault against the Allies. On June 
3, several American divi
-sions joined the French in turning back a German drive at Château-

Th
ierry. And at the battle of the Marne, during the last two weeks of 
July, the German offensive was brought to an end. 
Wilson had already begun planning for the aftermath of the war, 
an
d early in 
1918
 he addressed Congress and outlined “Fourteen Points” 
that he hoped would be the basis for a just and lasting peace, once Ger
-many had been defeated. These points included general disarmament, 

fr
eedom of the seas, open covenants openly arrived at, restoration of na
-tional boundaries, establishment of an in
de pen
dent Poland with access 
to the sea, the formation of a League of Nations, removal of artiﬁ
 cial 
barriers to international trade, an impartial settlement of colonial claims, 

self-
determination for Rus
sia, the restoration of Belgium, the return of 
Alsace-
Lorraine to France, and autonomy for the subject people of the 
Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
203 
Austrian-
Hungarian empire. What the United States was attempting 
to do by the Fourteen Points was to establish a new world order, some
-thing Wilson and the country would soon learn was impossible. 
The beginning of the disruption of Wilson’s hopes and plans com
-menced with the Allies’ decision to intervene in the civil war that had 
broken
 out in Rus
sia between the Bolsheviks and more conservative 
Rus sians called Whites, and although Wilson believed the action was 
wrong and counterproductive he reluctantly agreed to it under pressure 

from the Allies. Then the President foolishly asked the American 

people to return a Demo
cratic Congress in the midterm election of 
1918
 in order to forestall Eu
rope from interpreting a defeat of his party 
as a repudiation of his leadership. His request and his presumption of
-fended the electorate who responded by sending a majority of Republi
-cans to both 
houses of Congress. And just as he feared, Wilson’s 
leadership was seriously undermined by the Republican triumph. 

Meanwhile, the Eu
ropean war ended abruptly with the defeat of the 
German army and the collapse of the German government. By the 

time the armistice was signed on November 
11, the Kaiser, William II, 
had abdicated and ﬂ
ed to Holland. 
In late December 
1918
, Wilson traveled to Eu
rope with a large body 
of experts to attend the Versailles Peace Conference and work for a just 

peace. To his surprise and chagrin there  
were no representatives at the 
conference from the defeated powers or from Rus
sia. As matters turned 
out, it was Wilson (not the defeated powers) against the Allied 

leaders—Prime Minister David Lloyd George of Great Britain, Pre
-
mier Georges Clemenceau of France, and Prime Minister Vittorio 

Orla
ndo of 
Italy—who  
were determined to divide the territories of the 
conquered nations and make Germany pay for the cost of the war. By 

threatening to withdraw from the conference and leave Europe to stew 

in its own mess, Wilson did achieve a number of important conces
-sions. An in
de pen
dent Poland with access to the sea was established, 
Alsace-
Lorraine was returned to France, Belgium was restored, the 
peoples of the  
Austrian-
Hungarian empire won in
de pen
dence and 
self-
determination, and the Allies agreed to the establishment of a 
League of Nations. But Germany was saddled with an impossible $
56 billion in reparations, and the Allies divided German colonies among 

themselves, virtually inviting future retaliation. 
204 a short history of the united states 
The overthrow of the czarist regime in Rus
si
a, the ultimate victory 
of the Bolsheviks over the Whites, and the establishment of a commu
-nist state unleashed a wave of isolationist sentiment throughout the 
Un
ited States. The American people  
were in no mood to involve them
-selves any further in European affairs, and this hostile attitude rein
-forced the opposition of those in the Senate who  
were in
censed by Wilson’s failure to invite a congressional delegation to accompany him 

to Paris to attend the conference. And these senators, led by Henry 

Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela
-tions Committee, 
were deter
mined to block ratiﬁ
cation of the Ver
-sailles Treaty. They contended that the treaty jeopardized American 

secu
rity and the nation’s traditional foreign policy of neutrality. In ad
-dition, it did not exclude internal affairs from the jurisdiction of the 

Le
ague, and it contained no recognition of the Monroe Doctrine. 
Lodge therefore tied the treaty up in committee for six weeks in order 

to arouse public opposition against it. 
To counter his opponents, Wilson took his case directly to the peo
-ple in September 
1919 an
d pleaded his cause. He traveled nearly 
10,000 miles by railroad and gave dozens of speeches. But his health broke 

and, after attending a rally in Pueblo, Colorado, he collapsed. A few 

days later, on October 
2, he suffered a massive stroke and could no lon
-ger continue the ﬁ
 ght
. Meanwhile Lodge offered fourteen reservations, one of which re
-jected the obligation of the United States to preserve the in
de pen
dence and territorial integrity of member nations. This obligation, said Wil
-son, was the heart of the treaty, and he refused to delete it. The public 

ex
pected the two sides to agree on a compromise, but the President 
would not hear of it and thereby lost public support. Instead, he called 

on Demo
crats to defeat these reservations. Thus, on November 
19, 1919, when the treaty came up for a vote in the Senate with Lodge’s reserva
-tions attached, it was rejected. Then, a motion by Demo
cra
ts to ratify 
the treaty without reservations also went down to defeat, 
53 to 38. To a 
large extent, Wilson killed his own treaty. Not much later Congress 

adopted a resolution declaring the war with Germany at an end. Wilson 

vetoed it, and the  House failed to pass it over his veto. 
Isolated and incapacitated, Wilson announced that the approaching 
presi
dential election of 
1920
 should be a “great and solemn referendum” 
Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
205 
on the League. The Republicans, lacking an outstanding candidate, 
ev
entually chose Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio to head their 
ticket, after he ﬁ
rst assured the leadership that he had not been in
-volved in any scandal or improper behavior. Handsome and intellectu
-ally vapid, he managed to hide his numerous extramarital affairs. His 

geni
us, argued the historian John D. Hicks, “lay not so much in his 
ability to conceal his thought as in the absence of any serious thought 

to reveal.” The nominating convention also chose Calvin Coolidge of 

Massachusetts for Vice President. His outstanding achievement as 

governor, according to his supporters, was breaking a strike by Boston 

policemen. 
Demo
crats also ﬂ
oundered in naming their ticket. It took forty-
four 
ballots before the exhausted delegates chose James M. Cox, governor 

of Ohio, and Franklin D. Roo se
velt of New York, assistant secretary of 
the navy in the Wilson administration. Cox and Roo se
velt did attempt 
to focus the campaign on the League, but Americans had had enough 

of Eu
ropean involvement and  
were attracted by Harding’s “back to 
normalcy” and “America First” appeals. Not surprisingly, the election 

produced a landslide for the Republicans. They captured the presi
-dency, 
404 electoral votes to 
127
, and both 
houses of Congress. 
In his inaugural address, Harding went out of his way to kill any 
ho
pe that the country would join the League of Nations, declaring that 
the United States would “seek no part in directing the destinies of the 

world.” The gravely ill Wilson pronounced Harding’s remark a retreat 

into “sullen and selﬁ
sh isolation which is deeply ignoble because mani
-festly cowardly and dishonorable.” When Congress passed a resolution 

sim
ilar to the one vetoed by Wilson that ended the war with Germany, 
Harding signed it on July 
2, 1921.
 It signiﬁ
ed not only the country’s 
disengagement from active participation in European conﬂ
icts but a 
withdrawal into isolationism. 
As t h e nat ion 
entered t
he 
1920
s—known later as the Roaring 
Twenties—it soon became obvious that profound changes had taken 
place since the turn of the century. First, the census of 
1920
 revealed 
that most Americans now lived in or near 
cities— 
not on farms as was 
generally believed. More than 
13 million people moved from rural to 
206 a short history of the united states 
urban centers in the 
192
0s. They became city folk and worked in facto
-ries and ofﬁ
ces o
r ran local ser
vice establishments. Their manner, 
clothing, and style of living also reﬂ
ected the many changes that had 
taken place. The long, trailing dresses that women wore earlier in the 
century slowly gave way to shorter skirts revealing more and more leg. 

Large, plumed hats that required pins to keep them in place 
were no 
longer fashionable and  were discarded altogether or replaced by smaller, 

more comfortable ones. 
The most important exception to the generalization about the ur
-banization of the country was the South, which looked no “different 

than it had at the end of Reconstruction in the 
1870
s.” Southerners 
planted and harvested crops as they had for de 
cades, and suffered chronic 
agricultural depression. The grinding poverty inﬂ
icted on 
African-
Americans because of racial bigotry and discrimination sent 
500
,000 of them northward to industrial cities following World War I. They 

became an essential part of the population migration that so character
-ized the 
1920
s. Their number continued to rise during the de cade when 
another million blacks deserted the South and headed north to ﬁ
 nd employment in factories and packing 
houses. 
A postwar economic boom was one basic reason for this migration. 
An
d the boom developed because of a revolution in technology. New 
products 
were developed, new machines  
were invented, new methods 
were devised to increase productivity, and new industries were founded, 

in turn stimulating the nation’s economy. A good example of what was 

happening was the invention of the “horse less carriage.” Automobiles 

by the millions rolled off assembly lines in American factories in the 

1920
s. Henry Ford applied the assembly-line technique in producing 
his cars, and the Model T Ford became the favored means of transpor
-tation. By the end of this de 
cade the automobile industry provided 
employment for nearly 
4 million individuals. 
The electriﬁ
ca
tion of the nation also grew at a tremendous pace, 
with nearly seventy percent of American homes receiving electric 

power. The increase in the demand for power resulted in the expansion 

of the industry, and it soon became the second most important eco
-nomic activity in the country. Consequently, the production of home 

ap
pliances, motorized machines, and electric turbines also expanded. 
Radio transmitters and receivers, which had been invented prior to the 
Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
207 Great War, became another pop 
ul
ar commodity, resulting in a broad
-casting system that enveloped the nation. The motion picture camera 
had been in
vented by Thomas Edison in 
1896
, but not until the begin
-ning of the twentieth century did the motion picture industry emerge 

as
 an art form, especially with the production of 
The Birth of a Nation 
in 1915
. Motion picture theaters were opened in thousands of cities and 
towns, and by the 
1930
s the industry enjoyed an investment value of $
2 billion and employed nearly 
500
,000 people. 
Perhaps the most spectacular technological development of this pe
-riod in U.S. history was the growth of the airplane industry. It started at 

Ki
tty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 
17, 1903
, when Wilbur and 
Orville Wright made the ﬁrst successful ﬂ
ight aboard a  
heavier-
than-
air 
plane. During World War I, aviation began to show its value and im
-portance. Stimulated by the war, the airplane industry took off, and 

twe
nty-four plants 
were established, producing more than 
20,000 planes 
a year. Aviation became an integral part of the nation’s army and navy, 

and soon airplanes carried mail, passengers, and cargo around the world. 

Journeys that had once taken days, weeks, or months to complete now 

took only hours. Then, on May 
21, 1927
, in a solo ﬂ
ight, Charles A. 
Lindbergh ﬂ
ew his monoplane 
The Spirit of St. Louis
 from New York to 
Paris in 
thirty-
three hours nonstop. The age of ﬂ
ight had truly arrived. 
In time, especially after the introduction of jet-
powered planes, mem
-bers of Congress would ﬂ
y home to their districts for the weekend, go
-ing as far away from Washington as Alaska and Hawaii. 
A mer ic an societ y ch anged 
in m
any other ways following 
World War I. The Eigh
teenth Amendment to the Constitution, intro
-duced in 
1917
 an
d ratiﬁ
 ed in 
1919, prohibited the manufacture, sale, and 
transportation of intoxicating liquors. The Volstead Act, passed over 
Wilson’s veto on January 
16, 1920
, was intended to implement the 
Eigh
teenth Amendment. Prohibition had become law, but many 
Americans had no intention of changing their drinking habits. To ob
-tain liquor, they relied on bootleggers, or they made it themselves in 

th
eir bathtubs. This ac 
ceptance of illegal activities corrupted the think
-ing of Americans throughout the country and encouraged a carefree 

disreg
ard for the law. Even in Washington, among the very men who 
208 a short history of the united states 
voted for  
Pro
hibition, the law was ignored. Congressmen even had 
their own  
bootlegger, a man by the name of George L. Cassiday, who 
operated out of the  
House Ofﬁ
ce Building on In
de pen
dence Avenue. 
When Prohibition “ﬁ
rst came in,” declared Alice Roo 
sevelt 
Longworth—the daughter of Theodore Roo se
velt and the wife of the 
Speaker of the  
House of Representatives, Nicholas 
Longworth—“we 
grumbled, shrugged our shoulders, decided to use the stock we had, 
and when that was gone turn our attention to wine making and distill
-ing in the home, thinking that undoubtedly supplies would trickle in 

fr
om one source or another. I don’t think that we foresaw in the slight
-est degree the great bootlegging industry that was to develop, the com
-plete and or
ga
nized violation of law and order.” 
Because of the number of customers and the proﬁ
ts in
volved in the 
illegal transportation of liquor from foreign countries, such as Canada, 

criminals  
were drawn to the operation. Or ganized crime became ram
-pant. The Maﬁ
 a,
 an offshoot of a Sicilian criminal organi
zation, con
-trolled not only bootlegging but gambling and prostitution in the major 

citi
es. 
Many ordinary citizens frequented “speakeasies,” where they could 
pur
chase illegal liquor. In these dark, crowded places young women, 
called ﬂ
appers, could be seen dancing the Charleston or listening to 
jazz and the blues. Jazz began among black musicians in New Orleans 

but quickly spread north and reached Chicago just before World War I. 

Fundamentally African in its rhythms and tradition, jazz drew from 

black ragtime, but also included French, Spanish, and En
glish ele
-ments. In the 
192
0s it circled the globe and attracted the attention of 
serious composers. A number of pop ular musicians, such as Cole Por
-ter, Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, and George Gershwin, provided songs 

th
at became classics and 
were sung worldwide. These songs marked 
the beginning of an American musical tradition that was innovative 

and unique and extremely pop 
ular. 
In this jazz age ﬂ
ap
pers wore short dresses, cut their hair short, and 
smoked cigarettes. Having lost husbands, brothers, and boyfriends in 

the war, and parents in the inﬂ
uenza epidemic of 
1919–1920
, they ex
-hibited a carefree wildness and in
de pen
dence that represented an en
-tirely new version of the American woman. They had the vote and a 

sense of
 freedom that encouraged a boldness never expressed before. 
Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
209 In American literature a number of distinctive, talented voices were 
he
ard. The most important literary trend provided venturesome styles 
of writing in the novels of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, 
John Dos Passos, Theodore Dreiser, and Sherwood Anderson. They 

completed the full development of the naturalistic school of literature. 

In drama Eugene 
O’Neill virtually single-handedly created the Amer
-ican theater tradition. And such writers as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, e. e. 

cu
mmings, Robinson Jeffers, Robert Frost, and Carl Sandburg added 
outstanding and uniquely American works of poetry. A celebration of 

black culture known as the Harlem Re
nais 
sance, by such gifted writers 
as Langston Hughes, W. E. B. DuBois, James W. Johnson, Alain Locke, 

and Claude McKay emphasized both the joy and the pain of being 

African-
American. Paint
ers like Georgia O’Keeffe produced works that 
had a deﬁnite American cast, and Frank Lloyd Wright’s “prairie- 
style” 
architecture was so distinctive that it drew international attention. 
The Roaring Twenties generated an economy that seemed unstop
-pable in its growth and strength. Actually, it was headed for a resound
-ing crash. In addition, this period witnessed the renewed growth of the 

Ku Klux Klan throughout the South; then it migrated northward and 
established itself in many northern states. A “Red Scare,” emanating 

from a fear of communism and foreign inﬂ
uence in American life and 
culture, not only increased isolationism throughout the country but 

resulted in the arrest of hundreds of individuals suspected of subversive 

activities. The Red Scare intensiﬁ
ed after June 
2, 1919, when an assas
-sin attempted to kill the U.S. attorney general, A. Mitchell Palmer. 

Th
e courts dismissed any concern they should have had about the le
-gality of such arbitrary arrests as they too  
wer
e caught up in the excite
-ment over fear of foreign radicals. Such disdain for the law and the 

ru
les of society engulfed the nation and seeped into the operation of 
government on the local, state, and national levels. Corruption became 

widespread. 
In Washington this corruption reached monumental heights. At its 
he
ad was the President himself, Warren Gamaliel Harding. His per
-sonal tastes ran to booze, gambling, and  
se
x—not necessarily in that 
order. His immoral behavior was soon reﬂ
ected in the many scandals 
that permeated his administration. The most notorious of these scan
-dals occurred in 
192
1, when two naval oil reserves, at Teapot Dome in 
210 
a short history of the united states 
Wisconsin and Elk Hills in California,  
were tr
ansferred from the Navy 
Department to the Interior Department and subsequently leased, with
-out competitive bidding, to private oil companies. The secretary of the 
in
terior, Albert B. Fall, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
bribes while the lease was still being negotiated. When an investiga
-tion revealed the extent of the fraud, Fall ﬂ
ed to
 Eu
rope, but he was 
caught, brought home, tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison. He 

was the ﬁrst cabinet ofﬁ
cer in American history to be ﬁ
ned and impris
-oned for his crimes. Other members of the Harding administration 

al
so went to the penitentiary. Some committed suicide rather than face 
an investigation. 
The nation’s isolationism and xenophobia manifested themselves very 
di
stinctly in passage of the First Immigration Quota Act, on May 
19, 1921
, limiting the number of immigrants to be admitted to the country. 
Accordingly, the number of aliens of any nationality was not to exceed 

three percent of the number of persons of that nationality listed in the 

1910 census; also, the act set a limit of 
357,803
 immigrants per year. 
Just as the scandals of his administration 
were about t
o burst into 
public view, President Harding died suddenly of a heart attack on Au
-gust 
2, 1923
. The Vice President, Calvin Coo
lidge, was immediately 
sworn in, taking the oath at 
2:47 on the morning of August 
3. A deter-mined conservative, he pressured Congress to amend the Immigration 

Ac
t so that certain nationalities that he deemed unworthy of entering 
the United States would be discriminated against. As it turned out, he 

had considerable vocal support in Congress. “I think this chamber 

here,” pontiﬁ
cated Representative J. N. Tincher of Kansas, “is a place 
where we ought to think, act and do real Americanism.” By permitting 

more immigrants to enter this country, he argued, the day may come 

when a member of the  
House will have to say “Mr. Speaker in Italian 
or some other language.” 
Responding to the President’s request, Congress agreed to another 
immigration bill on May 
26, 1924
; this one lowered the quota of each 
nationality to be admitted to two percent, based on the 
1890
 census. Furthermore, only 
150
,000 immigrants would be admitted each year, 
and Japa
nese citizens 
were excluded altogether. But at least Native 
Americans  
were ﬁnally granted citizenship. On June 
2, 1924
, the In
-dian Citizenship Act was passed, providing equality in American soci
-Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
211 
ety to the native population. These two  
la
ws—the Immigration Act 
and the Indian Citizenship 
Act—stood in marked contrast to each 
other: the one restricted admission; the other extended citizenship 
rights. Because of the Immigration Act it was believed in some quar
-ters that within a generation or so the foreign-
bor
n would cease to be a 
major factor in American society. But this generalization did not take 

into account the number of illegal immigrants who would daily violate 

the border with Mexico and seek a new life in the United States. There 

was a large and eager market for unskilled laborers, especially in the 

farming industry. Fruit and vegetable growers in the Southwest chose 

not to ask probing questions of their workers about their legal status. 
Congress also passed the National Bud 
get an
d Accounting Act on 
June 
10, 1921
, that created for the ﬁ
rst time a Bud
get Bureau in the 
Trea
sury Department to regulate and supervise the expenditures of the 
national government. Later, during the Great Depression, President 

Franklin D. Roo
sevelt moved this bureau from the Trea
sury Depart
-ment to the White  
Ho
use in order to better control and regulate the 
sources and disbursement of funds. 
During the 
192
0s there was a considerable effort to provide social 
and economic improvements. Progressives in both parties—including 

such men as Senators Robert La Follette of Wisconsin, George Norris 

of Nebraska, William E. Borah of Idaho, and Burton K. Wheeler of 

Montana, along with Representatives Fiorello La Guardia of New 

York, John M. Nelson of Wisconsin, and Victor Berger, a Socialist, of 

Wisconsin—held a conference in Chicago in May 
1923
 in which they 
agreed upon a wide program of reform. They proposed child labor 

limitation, lower railroad rates, farm relief, freedom for the Philip
-pines, excess proﬁ
ts taxes, and limits on the power of injunctions which 
were issued by the courts to halt labor strikes. It would take 
time—more 
time than they expected or 
wished—but eventually most of these re
-forms  were enacted into law. 
The xenophobia and isolationism so prevalent during the 
192
0s were 
reﬂected in the presidential election of 
1924
. Naturally, the Republicans 
nominated Coo 
lidge, but a number of Insurgent Republicans formed a 
new Progressive Party and nominated Senator Robert La Follette. 

During the campaign they attracted Socialists, Bull Moosers, and 

Single Taxers. They proposed the nationalization of the railroads, 
212 
a short history of the united states 
public development of hydroelectric facilities, and the right of Con
-gress to override decisions of the Supreme Court. At the Demo
cratic 
con
vention northern delegates who represented Jews, Catholics, and 
the  
foreign-
born demanded the condemnation of the Ku Klux Klan 
and repeal of the Eigh
teenth Amendment, but southern delegates, 
controlled to a large extent by the KKK and representing religious fun
-damentalists, objected. After a protracted struggle between Governor 

Al
fred E. Smith of New York, a “wet” on Prohibition, a Catholic, and 
a chieftain of New York City’s Demo
cratic stronghold, Tammany  
Hall, 
and a former secretary of the treasury, William G. McAdoo, who sup
-ported southern “drys,” the convention gave the nod to John Davis, a 

Ne
w York lawyer with strong ties to banking and industrial interests. 
But it took 
103 ballots to produce this candidate. 
An important innovation occurred during the campaign. For the 
ﬁrs
t time the conventions  
were broadcast over the newest form of com
-munication, radio. Radio stations in New York, Washington, and six
-teen stations in twelve cities across the country, carried the proceedings. 

So
me politicians had a natural ﬂ
are for this new medium, such as 
Franklin D. Roo
sevelt. His speech for nomination of Governor Smith, 
wherein he dubbed him “the Happy Warrior of the politi
cal battle
-ﬁ eld,” electriﬁ
ed the audience and made him an instant celebrity. 
This new method of communication became immediately pop ular 
an
d necessitated the establishment of the Federal Radio Commission, 
with ﬁ
ve members appointed by the President to issue and revoke li
-censes for the operation of radio stations and to regulate programming. 

Th
e name of this commission was later changed to the Federal Com
-munications Commission (FCC), and granted additional power over 

tele
vision after its invention. 
Not unexpectedly, Coo
li
dge and the Republican Party enjoyed a 
stunning victory. Coo
lidge himself garnered over 
15 million votes, 
compared with 
8 million for Davis and almost 
5 million for La Follette. 
Both 
houses of Congress were also captured by the Republicans. 
The Roaring Twenties  
were ri
ghtly named. And how they 
roared. American songs, jazz, the shimmy (a dance), and illegal drink
-ing gave the 
192
0s a special and uniquely American quality. In addi
-Manifest Destiny, Progressivism, War, and the Roaring Twenties 
213 
tion, everyone seemed to be making money, one way or another. The 
stoc
k market soared; investors found all sorts of ways to increase their 
wealth, including buying on 
margin, that is, putting down only a frac
-tion of the cost of a stock with the idea of selling when the price  
ros
e and reaping a tidy proﬁ
t. It seemed so easy. 
Only farmers  
we
re excluded from this rich harvest. They continued 
to experience economic depression. Farm prices went into a steady de
-cline following World War I, and conditions on the farm became dire. 

Th
is should have been a warning of what might happen to the rest of 
the country. Farmers appealed to the government for help but received 

little. They formed a farm bloc and demanded subsidies to underwrite 

the unloading of farm surpluses overseas. But what few bills passed in 

Congress 
were quickly vetoed by Coolidge on the ground that the 
mea
sures constituted price ﬁ
xing for a special interest. Still, the linger
-ing farm depression might easily spread to the industrial and commer
-cial sectors of the country, and that could produce a major catastrophe. 
It came soon enough. 
In the presidential 
election of 
1928
 the Republicans chose 
Herbert Hoover to head their ticket, along with Charles Curtis, while 

the Democrats ﬁ
elded Alfred E. Smith and Joseph T. Robinson, a 

senator from Arkansas. During the campaign Hoover promised to pro
-vide relief for the despairing farmers, and this promise undoubtedly 

he
lped him to win the election overwhelmingly. He captured forty of 
the  
forty-
eight states for a total of 
444 electoral votes while Smith won 
the remaining eight states with 
87 electoral votes. This election also 
brought the ﬁ
 rst 
African-
American from outside the south to Con
-gress. Republican Oscar S. Priest of Illinois took a seat in the  House of 

Re
presentatives and served with distinction from 
1929
 to 1935. Because 
Washington was so racially segregated, he was forced to dine in the 

basement of the Capitol next to the kitchen rather than in the  all-
white 
dining room for congressmen on the ﬁ
 rst ﬂ
 oor. 
Hoover called Congress into special session to deal with the eco
-nomic problems facing farmers and suggested raising the tariff on all 

im
ported agricultural products. Despite many problems, which took 
more than a year to resolve, Congress ﬁ
nally enacted the  
Smoot-
Hawley 
214 
a short history of the united states 
Tariff and the President signed it on June 
17, 1930
. It was the highest 
tariff ever passed by Congress and raised import duties on agricultural 
items to 
forty-
ﬁve percent, with special protection awarded to sugar, 
cotton, and citrus fruits. These increases  
were so excessive that 
twenty-
six foreign countries retaliated by raising their rates, and Amer
-ican exports took a nosedive. To aid the farmers even further, Congress 

pa
ssed the Agricultural Market Act in June 
1929,
 which established the 
Federal Farm Board of eight members plus the secretary of agriculture 

and created a revolving fund of $
500
 million for 
low-
interest loans to 
cooperatives to build ware 
houses and sell surplus crops. 
But these efforts came too late. On October 
23, 192
9, the stock mar
-ket crashed, and thus began the worst economic depression in the na-

tion’
s history. 
8The Great Depression, the New 
Deal, a
nd World War II
Within one dre adful
 month the stock market continued 
its descent until something like $
30 billion in the market value 
of listed stocks was wiped out. This economic collapse would continue 
for ten years. Businesses by the hundreds went bankrupt, unemploy
-ment soared, deﬂ
at
ion resulted, and the price of commodities hit an 
all-
time low. 
There  
were man
y causes for this disaster, besides those already sug
-gested. The Federal Reserve banking system had not been properly 

ru
n, allowing all manner of improper procedures to generate proﬁ
 ts; 
abuse of credit invited investors to buy stocks without paying the full 

price; a high incidence of criminal dishonesty had seeped through the 

business community; and the inﬂ
exibility of the gold standard system. 
To address the growing agony, President Hoover called for a relief 
pr
ogram that would initiate federal leadership to assist voluntary ef
-forts at the state and local levels. He also requested funds in the amount 

of $
100 million to $
150
 million for a program of public works. But by 
the summer of 
1931
 conditions had worsened, and the depression inten
-siﬁ
ed for the next ﬁ
ve years. Approximately 
2,300
 banks, with deposits 
of over $
1.5 billion, failed that summer. The number of unemployed in
-creased from 
7 mil
lion in 
1931
 to 14 million by 
1936
. People migrated from 
the cities back to the countryside in the hope of scratching out a living. 

People starved, they lost their homes through foreclosures; they took 
216 
a short history of the united states 
charity where they could ﬁ
nd
 it; they begged for help. There was a 
profound loss of conﬁ
dence in both business and government. A num
-ber of congressional investigations turned up evidence that bankers 
had mi
sappropriated the funds of depositors and had manipulated the 
stock market in a gamble for greater returns. Investment bankers  were 

seen as villains who, by their actions, had brought on the depression, and 

Americans blamed Herbert Hoover for failing to bring it to an end. The 

secretary of the trea
sury, Andrew Mellon, argued that somehow the 
normal operations of the business cycle would come into play and bring 

about an upswing in economic conditions. It was simply a matter of 

waiting it out. “Let the slump liquidate itself,” he declared. “Liquidate 

labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers
. . . . 
 People will work 
harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising 
people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.” Small won
-der the American people came to loathe the Hoover administration. 
Strangely, Americans did not lose conﬁ
dence i
n the capitalist sys
-tem. Communism did not attract them, nor did  
fasc
ism—unlike 
citizens of several Eu
ropean nations. And although there 
were some 
hunger marches and riots, the actual number of violent incidents was 

relatively few. Perhaps the most spectacular display of or
ganized 
marches was the “Bonus March” on Washington that occurred in 
1932
, when 
12,000 to 15,000 unemployed war veterans descended on the 
capital and demanded immediate payment in cash of the bonus prom
-ised them in 
192
4 when Congress authorized it over Coo
lidge’s veto. It 
was meant to compensate veterans for their  
low-
paying ser
vice during 
the last war compared with the high wages earned by civilians. The act 

provided compensation to all veterans on the basis of $
1.25 a day for 
overseas ser
vice and $
1 a day for ser
vice in the United States. Unfortu
-nately the bonus was not to be paid until 
1945
. Bu
t these veterans and 
their families 
were starving. They needed the money now, and they 
demanded that the government give it to them. To bolster their spirits 

they sang war songs and displayed placards that read: “Cheered in 

’17, Jeered in ’
32.” Just outside the capital, on Anacostia Flats, they built 
shelters that constituted little more than a shantytown. Then violence 

erupted, causing two deaths, whereupon President Hoover summoned 

the army, under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, then 

chief of staff, to restore order. Using excessive force, which was hardly 
217 The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
nec
essary, the army dispersed the veterans with tear gas and then 
burned the 
shantytown. The incident only led to further bitterness to
-ward the government. 
The Hoover administration did propose a Reconstruction Finance 
Co
rporation (RFC) that would create a government lending agency with 
a capital of $
500
 million and authority to borrow up to an additional $
1.5 billion. Some Demo
crats and Progressives dubbed it a “millionaires’ dole.” 
What was needed, they insisted, was a national system of unemployment 
insurance. Despite this criticism, the RFC passed Congress on January 

22, 1932
, and the agency subsequently extended credit to banks, corpora
-tions, life insurance companies, building and loan associations, farm 

mo
rtgage societies, and railroads. However, it did not assist small busi
-nesses or individuals threatened with the loss of their homes; neverthe
-less, it did prevent the largest banks throughout the country from going 

ban
krupt. Then, on July 
21, 1932
, an Emergency Relief and Construction 
Act passed, broadening the scope and authority of the RFC to aid con
-struction and agricultural agencies and provide funds to states that were 

un
able to ameliorate economic distress within their jurisdiction. 
On February 
27, 1932
, Congress also enacted the  
Glass-
Steagall Bill, 
permitting the Federal Reserve Bank to sell $
750 million from the gov-
ernment’s supply of gold, which had been used to support the currency 

in order to meet the continuing foreign withdrawals. This mea
sure was 
also designed to counteract the hoarding of gold by citizens. In July the 

Federal Home Loan Bank Act established a series of eight to twelve 

banks around the country by which savings banks, insurance compa
-nies, and building and loan associations might join and thereby have 

th
e capital to provide home mortgages for home buyers. The act was 
intended to prevent foreclosures. 
Two Progressives in Congress—Senator George W. Norris and 
Repr
esentative Fiorello La 
Guardia—sponsored the Norris–La Guar
-dia Act, which recognized labor’s right to 
unionize. It outlawed “yellow 

dog” con
tracts, which obliged workers to promise not to join a  union, 
and it limited the power of the federal courts to issue injunctions 

against labor’s right to or
ganize. 
But efforts to provide federal money for relief and public works  
were resisted by H
oover, who insisted that the government should help end 
the depression by balancing the bud
get and should cease enlarging the 
218 
a short history of the united states 
pork barrel. A proposed $
900 mi
llion for public works, he argued, was 
an outright “raid on the public trea
sury.” Nevertheless, a $
2 billion 
relief 
mea
sure passed Congress, only to be vetoed by the President. He par
-ticularly opposed a feature that allowed the RFC to make loans to indi
-viduals and small businesses. He also vetoed a bill for the construction 
of a h
ydroelectric facility, at Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee River in 
northern Alabama, which would provide electriﬁ
cation for a vast area of 
the Southeast. The President called the measure a gigantic leap by the 

government into private business. To him it smacked of socialism. 
The devastating economic 
collapse gave Demo
cr
ats un
-bounded conﬁ
dence that they could achieve a monumental victory in 
th
e  upcoming presidential election. They held their convention in 
Chicago in June 
1932
, and since expectations ran high, the contest for 
the nomination turned into a battle royal between the forces of Al 

Smith, supported by Tammany Hall, and the Governor of New York, 

Franklin D. Roo
sevelt, who had won reelection in 
1930
 by the largest 
majority ever received by a gubernatorial candidate in the state’s his
-tory. A Harvard graduate who had studied law at Columbia University, 

an
 assistant secretary of the navy during the administration of Wood
-row Wilson, FDR suffered an attack of polio in 
192
1 but through deter
-mined efforts had achieved partial recovery by 
192
8. Although he 
enjoyed the backing of a majority of delegates, he lacked the necessary 

two-
thirds for nomination. Not until the fourth ballot, after the very 
conservative John Nance Garner of Texas, the Speaker of the  House of 

Representatives, threw his support to Roo 
sevelt, was he nominated to 
head the Demo
cratic ticket. In return, Garner received the vice presi
-dential nomination, which would remove him from his much more 

powe
rful position as Speaker, something reform-
minded Demo
crats 
had hoped to do. Disregarding the tradition by which a candidate nor
-mally waited until he was formally notiﬁ
ed of
 his nomination, Roo se
-velt ﬂ
ew from Albany, New York, to Chicago to personally deliver his 
acceptance speech. His ﬂ
 ight electriﬁ
ed the entire nation. And on his 
arrival at the convention he made a solemn vow to the delegates: “I 

pledge you, I pledge myself, to a New Deal for the American people.” 
The party platform demanded repeal of the Eigh
teen
th Amend
-219 
The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
ment and promised a reduction of federal expenditures to balance the 
budget and a removal of the federal government from all areas of pri
-vate activity “except where necessary to develop public works and natu
-ral resources.” It further promised to send money to the states in order 

to p
rovide relief for the unemployed, to reduce tariff levels, and to re
-form the banking system so as to maintain a sound currency. 
The Republicans renominated Hoover on the ﬁ
rs
t ballot, and Vice 
President Charles Curtis; and they put forward a platform calling for a 

balanced bud
get, reduced government spending, loans to the states for 
relief, the repeal of the Eigh
teenth Amendment, and continuation of a 
protective tariff, among other things. Except for the tariff, the two 

platforms were exactly alike in many respects. 
This election also produced an especially large number of po
liti
cal parties offering candidates for the presidency and vice presidency, in
-cluding the Prohibition, Communist, and Socialist parties. The Pro
-
hibition Party nominated William D. Upshaw and Frank S. Regan; 

th
e Communist Party, William Z. Foster and James W. Ford; and the 
Socialist Party, Norman Thomas and James H. Maurer. All told, 

there 
were eight parties in this race. 
Strangely, both major parties during the campaign seemed more 
con
cerned about getting rid of Prohibition than about ﬁ
 nding jobs for 
the unemployed. Perhaps they felt that repealing the Eigh
teenth 
Amendment would be easier than solving the nation’s economic prob
-
lems. “Here we are, in the midst of the greatest crisis since the Civil 

Wa
r,” sniffed the phi
los
opher and educator John Dewey, “and the only 
thing the two national parties seem to want to debate is booze.” 
Actually, Roo 
sevelt g
ave any number of radio addresses in which he 
outlined a program of social and economic reforms. With the assis
-tance of a group of Columbia professors, known as the “brain trust,” 

an
d including such men as Adolph A. Berle, Raymond Moley, and 
Rexford G. Tugwell, he said, it was the duty of government to adapt 

existing economic organizations to the needs of the people, and to ﬁ
 nd the means by which the distribution of wealth and products would be 

more equitable. Naturally, Hoover savaged FDR’s goals as a radical 

departure from traditional American values and practices. He called 

for the decentralization of government in order to allow private busi
-ness to expand. But his mood and tone sounded depressing, whereas 
220 a short history of the united states 
Roosevelt exuded conﬁ
dence that he was the man who could rescue the 
nation from this terrible disaster. He scored many points with the 
American people by alluding to Hoover’s supposed callousness toward 

the starving and his seeming unwillingness to aid those in distress. 
The results of the election of 
1932
 completely reversed the po
liti
cal 
fortunes of the two major parties. Roo 
sevelt swept the cities and rural 
areas outside New En
gland for a total of nearly 
23 million pop
ular and 
472
 electoral votes. Hoover carried Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, 
Connecticut, Delaware, and Pennsylvania with almost 
16 million pop
-ular and  
59 electoral votes. The Socialist, Thomas, won almost 
900,000 pop
ular votes; the Communist, Foster, won 
100
,000; and the Prohibi
-tionist, Upshaw, 
80,000. An
d both 
houses of Congress  
were won by 
the Demo
crats. 
The  
lame-
duck Congress did nothing to address the worsening eco
-nomic conditions in the country. Its members simply did not know 

what t
o do. They let everything slide until the new administration 
could take ofﬁ
ce on March 
4, 1933. Industrial construction had plunged 
from $
949
 million to a disastrous $
74 million. Depositors attempting 
to withdraw their money from banks caused runs on these institutions, 

and many of them went bankrupt. Some 
50,504
 banks closed from 
1930 
through February 
1933. Fourteen million people  
were out of work. 
There was talk that what the nation desperately needed was a dictato
-rial direction of the government. “A genial and lighthearted dictator 

mi
ght be a relief,” editorialized one publication, “from the pompous 
futility of such a Congress as we have recently had.” In Germany, such 

a dictator had already emerged, but he was hardly genial and light
-hearted. Adolf Hitler was chosen chancellor in January 
1933 an
d would 
later plunge Eu
rope and the world into further chaos. 
Franklin D. Roo 
sevel
t was sworn into ofﬁ
ce on March 
4, the 
last President to take the oath of ofﬁ
ce four months after his election. On 
February 
6, 1933, the Twentieth Amendment was ratiﬁ
ed which directed 
that henceforth the members of Congress who  were elected the previous 

November would take ofﬁ
ce on January 
3 and the President and Vice 
President on January 
20 instead of March 
4. In his i
naugural address, 
Roosevelt tried to restore conﬁ
 dence in the ability of the government to 
221 The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
successfully address the dreadful conditions that existed throughout the 
country. Again, he pledged that he would provide a dynamic program of 

action to restore prosperity. “This great nation,” he exclaimed, “will en
-dure, as it has endured, will revive and prosper. So, ﬁ
rst o
f all, let me as
-sert my ﬁ
rm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” 
It was exactly what Americans needed to hear. And the New Deal, 
as F
DR’s program was called, began to function immediately. First, 
Roosevelt shut all the banks in the country for four days. Next, he 
summoned Congress to a special session on March 
9. As members of 
the  
House  
were still ﬁ
nding their way into the chamber on the desig
-nated day, the Speaker, Henry T. Rainey of Illinois, started reading the 

on
ly available copy of the administration’s Emergency Banking Relief 
bill, which contained  
last-
minute corrections written in pencil. After 
thirty-
eight minutes of supporting speeches, the bill passed the  
House 
sight unseen by a unanimous voice vote. Within the ﬁ
rst four hours of 
the session Congress enacted a banking bill that authorized the secre
-tary of the trea
sur
y to investigate the ﬁ
nancial conditions of every bank 
in the country and permit only those banks that proved sound to re
-open. The bill also declared illegal the own
er
ship of gold and in
-structed the trea
sur
y secretary to call in all gold and gold certiﬁ
 cates. 
By midsummer at least  
three-
quarters of all banks in the country had 
reopened and resumed normal operations. Conﬁ
dence had been re
-stored, if slowly, and the runs on banks virtually ceased. 
This special session, which lasted until June 
16 an
d was known as 
the “Hundred Days,” succeeded in enacting a comprehensive corps of 

legislation involving banking, agriculture, labor, industry, and unem
-ployment relief. Indeed, this First New Deal aimed speciﬁ
ca
lly at ad
-dressing the problems of relief and recovery. 
Even before the New Deal got under way, Congress had begun the 
process o
f responding to pop
ular demand for the repeal of the Eigh
-teenth Amendment. The  
Twe
nty-
First Amendment passed both 
houses on February 
3, 1933, and won ratiﬁ
cation by the states on De
-cember 
5, 1933. At th
e same time this amendment made its way through 
the states, FDR asked Congress to end Prohibition by legalizing beer. 

Within a week the bill passed, and the President signed it on March 

22. Beer and wine of 
3.2 percent alcoholic content  
were now legal. 
Prohibition proved to be an excellent example of what not to do in 
222 
a short history of the united states 
tampering with the Constitution. It needs to be remembered that the 
docu
ment outlines the structure of government and its responsibilities. 
It is not meant to reﬂ
ect each and every passing fancy, many of which 
are social fads of limited value or duration. 
As the congressional session progressed it became clear that party 
leadersh
ip had shifted to the White  House. Because of the crisis facing 
the nation, the need for quick and decisive action, as well as the popu
-larity of the President, Congress willingly abdicated its authority. Roo
-
sevelt himself had no strong commitment to a partic
ular economic 
program but was willing to experiment to ﬁ
nd the means with which 
to combat the depression. He quickly established direct contact with 

the electorate through  
regularly held press conferences and especially 
through his radio talks, called “ﬁ
reside chats.” But he was deﬁ
 cient as 
an administrator, frequently dividing authority and responsibility 

among subordinates in the hope of maintaining his own control. 
And control legislation is exactly what he did. “I have seen the Con
-gress of the United States,” commented one Republican Representative 

from Tennessee, “absolutely abdicate its authority to the Executive. I 
have seen a dictatorship spring up which must have made the noses of 

Herr Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and Mustapha Kemal of Turkey turn 

green with envy.” 
During the ﬁ
rs
t Hundred Days an avalanche of legislation descended 
on Congress and was immediately enacted. These included the Civil
-ian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Federal Emergency Relief Act 

(F
ERA), the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), the Tennessee Val
-ley Authority (TVA), the Federal Securities Act, the Gold Standard 

Re
peal Act, the National Employment System Act, the Home Own 
ers 
Reﬁnancing Act, the Banking Act of 
1933, the Farm Credit Act, the 
Emergency Railroad Transportation Act, and the National Industrial 

Recovery Act (NIRA). These mea
sures provided employment for 
250,000 jobless male citizens between the ages of eigh
teen and  
twenty-
eight (CCC); allowed outright grants to states to initiate work relief 

(FERA); created an agency to control surplus crops so as to raise farm 

prices (AAA); established an in
de pen
dent public agency to build dams 
and power plants and develop rural electriﬁ
cation (TVA); required full 
disclosure to investors of information about securities; removed the 

United States from the gold standard and made all contracts and public 
223 
The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
obligations payable in legal tender; authorized a national employment 
system; set up the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to guarantee 

individual bank deposits under $
5,000 (FDIC); created the Home 
Owners Loan Corporation to reﬁ
nance home mortgages for own
ers 
who  
were not farmers (HOLC); reﬁ
nanced farm mortgages for long 
terms at low interest; and instituted a better rule of 
rate-
making to 
improve the operation of railroads. The NIRA established the Public 

Works Administration to stimulate the economy by constructing huge 

public works, and it guaranteed the right of workers to organize and 
bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. 
By the time this Hundred Day Special Session of Congress ended, 
an extraordinary variety of economic reforms had been enacted. Farm
-ers, laborers, and industrialists  
were af
fected. By this legislation the 
nation had committed itself to assist the unemployed, guarantee bank 

deposits, protect individual homeowners and farmers, and undertake 

vast public works projects. 
Still, the depression persisted. By the end of 
1933 th
e income of most 
Americans had declined by half. A million or more individuals had 

been evicted from their homes when they could not pay the rent or 

meet their mortgage payments. Some 
9,000 banks and 
86,000 busi
-nesses had failed. A farmer received ten cents for a bushel of oats, sev
-eral pennies below what it had cost him to raise the crop. Approximately 

20 mi
llion Americans during this awful time needed some form of 
federal relief to stay alive. 
The growing reliance by Congress on the chief executive to move 
th
e country out of the depression was demonstrated most forcefully 
when the administration proposed a Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act 

that permitted the President to raise or lower existing tariff rates up to 

ﬁfty percent for countries that would reciprocate with similar conces
-sions. Republicans in the  
Ho
use of Representatives strongly objected to 
the proposal, claiming that it violated the Constitution because all bills 

raising revenue must originate in the lower  
house. So the Demo
crats 
amended the bill to limit the President’s negotiating power to three 

years and to terminate any agreement after three years. The measure 

then passed, and Roo 
sevelt signed it on June 
12, 1934
. By this action 
Congress surrendered to the executive a power it had jealously guarded 

for more than 
150
 years. 
224 
a short history of the united states 
This Congress also established the Securities and Exchange Com
-mission on June 
6, 1934
, to prevent price manipulation of stocks and 
curb speculation and unfair practices in the securities market. The 
Corporate Bankruptcy Act, passed on June 
7, attempted to assist in the 
reor
ganization of corporations that could not meet their ﬁ
 nancial obli
-gations. And the Federal Farm Mortgage Foreclosure Act extended 

lo
ans to farmers on favorable terms so as to prevent foreclosures. 
In the  
midterm election of 
1934,
 when traditionally the party in 
power loses seats, the results came as a blow to the Republicans. They 

had expected to increase their membership in Congress, but this time 

they lost seats in both the  House and the Senate. As one historian has 

pointed out, never in its history had the Republican Party taken such a 

loss. In the  
House they now had only 
103 members, whereas the Demo
-crats had 
322 an
d the In
de pen
dents 
10. The situation in the Senate was 
just as bad. The Demo
crats held 
69 seats, the Republicans 
25, and In-
de pen
dents 
2. But an opposition to FDR’s policies had arisen in the country not 
on
ly among conservative businessmen who felt that he coddled labor 
and was spending the country into bankruptcy but also among more 

radical-
thinking leftists. Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, for ex
-ample, proposed to divide the wealth of the country and give every 

fam
ily a guaranteed annual wage of $
2,500
. Father Charles E. Cough
-lin, a priest in Detroit who had a large radio audience, attacked Roo se
-velt as a tool of Wall Street, while Dr. Francis E. Townsend of 

Ca
lifornia demanded a $
200
 monthly pension for every person over 
sixty years of age. 
In his annual address to Congress, delivered on January 
4, 1935, FD
R jettisoned much of the First New Deal and outlined a program of 
social reform that historians have called the Second New Deal. First 

came a $
5 billion 
work-
relief program authorized by the Emergency 
Relief Appropriation Act of April 
8, 1935, which set up the Works 
Progress Administration (WPA). Roo 
sevelt invited Harry Hopkins, a 
leading advocate of the welfare state, to head this agency. Jobs  
were created for professionals such as musicians, actors, writers, and histori
-ans as well as college students, clerks, secretaries, and other unem
-ployed workers. Over the next six years the WPA spent more than $
11 billion and gave employment to millions of Americans. 
225 The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
Hard on the heels of this Emergency Relief Act came the Soil Con
-servation Act (April 
27);
 the Rural Electriﬁ
 cation 
Administration 
(May 
11); the National Youth Administration (June 
26) established by 
executive order granted by the Emergency Relief Act; and perhaps 
most important of all, the Social Security Act (August 
14). The Social 
Security Act established a  
federal- 
state system of unemployment com
-pensation and old age pensions, thereby transferring to the federal 

go
vernment functions that once had been the responsibility of families 
and of state and local governments. It imposed a tax on employees’ 

wages and employers’ payrolls beginning on January 
1, 1937
, but would 
not begin to pay retirement beneﬁ
 ts until 
1942
, a date later advanced to 
1940 by amendments passed in 
1939
. But it failed to provide coverage 
for domestic servants, agricultural workers, public workers, and cer
-tain professionals. Later the act was amended to cover many more 

employe
es. 
Also important was passage on August 
23 of
 the Banking Act of 
1935, the only fundamental revision of the Federal Reserve Act since its 
inception. By this act a new board of governors had direct and com
-plete control over interest rates, reserve requirements, and the open 

mar
ket operations of the Federal Reserve banks. 
Earlier, on July 
5, th
e National Labor Relations Act, better known 
as the Wagner Act after one of its sponsors, Senator Robert Wagner of 

New York, created a board with authority to oversee collective bargain
-ing by labor and management. It placed government in support of the 

ri
ght of labor to bargain collectively, and it required employers to per
-mit the peaceful 
un
ionization of their companies. The Wagner Act 
and the Social Security Act  
were probably the most radical of the bills 
of the Second New Deal. In addition, the Holding Company Act (Au
-gust 
28) broke up the large electric and gas holding companies and 
placed the ﬁ
nancial operations of these companies under the supervi
-sion of the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). The legislation 

ul
timately abolished holding companies. 
Despite FDR’s numerous victories in Congress, by the close of his 
ﬁrs
t term as President he faced growing opposition from conservative 
Demo
crats and Republicans. He also, unexpectedly, faced the opposi
-tion of the Supreme Court. On “Black Friday,” May 
27, 1935, in a 
unanimous decision, the court struck down the industry code  
provisions 
226 
a short history of the united states 
of the NIRA in the case 
Schec
hter Poultry Corp. v
. United States
. The 
court declared that Congress had improperly delegated power to pri
-vate industry and interfered in businesses engaged in intrastate activi
-ties; and that Congress had also delegated legislative authority to the 
ex
ecutive that was unwarranted by the Constitution. The following 
January, in 
United States v. Butler
, the court declared unconstitutional 
the Agricultural Adjustment Act that authorized payment to farmers 

to keep land out of production, because this law invaded state power 

over intrastate commerce. Then in May 
1936
, in the bituminous coal 
case, the court invalidated the Coal Conservation Act, declaring that 

coal mining was a local activity. The Supreme Court had effectively 

paralyzed the ability of the President and Congress to deal with the 

depression. In some of these cases the decision resulted from a bare 

majority, and critics accused the court of attempting to legislate by ju
-dicial decree. 
Critics insisted that the Supreme Court had to be curbed by remov
-ing its right of judicial review, or by requiring unanimity to declare a 

law unconstitutional, or by allowing Congress to override a court rul
-ing with a  
two
-thirds vote, the same procedure and authority it had in 
overriding a presidential veto. 
Matters came to a head when Roo 
sevelt wo
n another landslide vic
-tory in the presidential contest of 
1936
 over the Republican Alfred M. 
Landon of Kansas. During the convention the Democrats abolished 

the traditional 
two-
thirds vote necessary for  
nomination—which had 
been the rule since the ﬁ
 rst Demo
cratic convention in 
1832
—and re
-placed it with a simple majority. In his ac 
ceptan
ce speech Roo 
sevelt 
decried the new “despotism wrapped in the robes of legal sanction.” 

The Republican platform denounced the New Deal as a gross violation 

of the Constitution and accused Roo
sevelt of usurping the powers of 
Congress. 
But FDR’s extraordinary popularity with the electorate won him 
60.4 percent of the pop 
ul
ar vote and every state in the  
Union except 
Maine and Vermont. He carried with him a great number of Demo
-crats running for federal and state ofﬁ
ces. In t
he  
House of Represen
-tatives there was an overwhelming majority of 
333 se
ats, compared to 
89 for Republicans; in the Senate the count was 
76 to 16. Encouraged 
by this strong show of support, Roo 
sevelt unwisely decided to remake 
227 The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
the membership of the Supreme Court. He planned to ask Congress 
for authority to appoint a new judge for each judge who had served on 

the court for at least ten years and did not retire within six months 

after reaching the age of seventy. Among the nine members of the 

Supreme Court (the “nine old men,” as they 
were derisively called), six 
justices had already passed the age of seventy. It was clear to everyone 

that FDR was seeking revenge for the recent court decisions striking 

down essential programs of the New Deal. If such a plan ever won 

congressional approval, it would mean that the court would be ex
-panded to ﬁ
fteen members. And since FDR would name six of them, 
he would be certain to form a majority of pro–New Deal justices. The 

President chose not to inform the party’s leadership in Congress in 

advance of his intentions for the simple reason that, in the words of 

Speaker William Bankhead, “he knew that all hell would break 

loose.” 
And it did. The inviolability of the court had long been acknowl
-edged. Its tradition of standing above politics and partisanship was 

gener
ally understood and appreciated by the American people. But 
FDR saw only its conservative bent and its apparent opposition to so
-cial and economic reforms. So he insisted on going ahead with his 

“co
urt- 
packing” scheme. Many Americans saw his plan as an uncon
-scionable attempt to destroy the in
de pen
dence of the judicial system. 
And his efforts only further alienated many members of Congress who 

had resented his assumption of legislative authority and had kept quiet 

for fear of reprisals from their constituents. Now that the election had 

passed, they 
were less hesitant about demonstrating their dis plea
sure. 
In fact, a split within the Demo
cratic party had already begun along 
regional and ideological lines. A new conservative bipartisan co 
ali
tion 
emerged among southern Democrats and northern Republicans. They 

no longer feared pop
ular reprisals, because they knew that the elector
-ate would resist any tampering with the Supreme Court. The chairman 

of the  
House Judiciary Committee, Hatton Summers of Texas, re
-joiced. “Boys,” he cried, “here’s where I cash in my chips.” 
FDR’s decision was also badly timed, because in March 
1937
 the Court had already indicated its recognition of and sympathy with some 

of the purposes of the New Deal and had approved several important 

pieces of legislation. A minimum-wage bill was upheld (
West Coast 
228 
a short history of the united states 
Hotel v. Parris
),
 as was the National Labor Relations Act (
NLRB v. 
Jones and Loughlin Steel Corp.
). Most important, the justices approved 
the Social Security legislation in 
Steward Machine Co. v. Davis
. By 
these decisions the Court ended the quarrel with the President. FDR 
lost the battle but won the war. Instead of his  court-
packing bill, he 
was forced to accept a weaker mea
sure, the Judicial Procedure Reform 
Act, on August 
26, 1937
. This legislation permitted federal judges to 
retire at full pay after they reached age seventy, but did not authorize 

the appointment of new federal judges. In time, with the retirement of 

many of the “nine old men,” the President ﬁ
lled the Supreme Court 
with New Dealers, and this “Roo 
sevelt Court” upheld the constitu
-tionality of every important New Deal mea
sure. The failure of the  
cour
t-
packing scheme had one beneﬁ
cial result: it 
helped restore a better balance between the executive and legislative 

branches. No longer could FDR expect Congress to accede to his every 

wish. A proper respect for the prerogatives of Congress was necessary 

if the President expected to win approval for his more controversial mea
-sures. Henceforth he found it beneﬁ
ci
al to consult with congressional 
leaders beforehand and try to accommodate their needs and wishes. 
One important success came on September 
1, 1937
, with passage of 
the National Housing Act. Senator Robert Wagner had been trying for 

years to get it enacted, but the  House defeated it. Henry Steagall, 

chairman of the 
House Housing Committee, considered the mea
sure 
ﬁnancially reckless and socialist. Roo se
velt then stepped in and used his 
charm to persuade Steagall to allow the bill out of his committee so it 

could be voted on by the members, knowing full well that a majority of 

them would approve it. Out of a sense of party loyalty, Steagall agreed. 

The  
Wagner-
Steagall Housing Act, as passed, created the United 
States Housing Authority as a public corporation under the Depart
-ment of the Interior and made available $
500 million in loans for 
low- 
cost housing. By 
1941
 the authority had provided funds for build
-ing more than 
500 
low-
rent buildings containing 
161,000 apartments, 
at a cost of $
767
,526
,000. A sharp recession 
early in 
1938
, resulting in part from Roo se-
velt’s efforts to balance the budget at the same time that the new Social 
229 The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
Security tax was imposed, brought a decline of industrial production, 
higher unemployment, and another stock market decline. Several ad
-ditional New Deal mea
sure
s  were enacted by which billions of dollars 
were pumped into the WPA and AAA. The Minimum Wage and 

Hours Act of 
1938
 not only prohibited child labor but mandated a mini
-mum wage of 
twe
nty-
ﬁve cents an hour, to be increased to forty cents, 
and limited a workweek to 
forty-
four hours the ﬁ
rst year and forty 
hours thereafter. Almost 
1 million workers beneﬁ
ted by this mea
sure. 
The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act won approval in June 
1938
, wi
d-ening the Pure Food and Drug Act of 
1906
. It required the manufac
-turers of food, drugs, and cosmetics to list the ingredients on labels, 

an
d it prohibited false and misleading advertisements. Violations would 
incur heavy ﬁ
 nes. 
One important aspect of the New Deal was its revolutionary stimu
-lation of the labor movement. Labor had gained the right of bargaining 

on m
ore or less equal terms with management in most industries. The 
American Federation of Labor (AFL), founded in 
1886
 by Adolph 
Strasser and Samuel Gompers of the Cigar Makers’ International 

Union of New York, consisted mostly of skilled workers. Gompers was 

elected president and served every year but one from 
1886
 until his 
death in 
1924
. He chose to lead the  
union toward higher wages and 
shorter work hours, rather than the more radical wing of the labor 

movement, which aimed to bring about  wholesale reform of the move
-ment to include unskilled workers. By 
1936 certain labor leaders, nota
-bly John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers  Union and Sidney 

Hi
llman and David Dubinsky, presidents of the garment workers’ 
unions, demanded that the AFL or
ganize industries, irrespective of 
the work performed by their laborers, so that the still unorganized in
-dustries, such as automobiles, steel, and rubber, could be 
unio
nized. 
The old, conservative leaders of the AFL refused, whereupon Lewis 

and others, in 
1937
, formed the Committee for Industrial Organi
zation 
(CIO), which became a separate and inde 
pen
dent labor or
ganization. 
It soon 
unionized the steel and automobile industries and others, al
-though the workers sometimes had to resort to sit-
down st
rikes in 
which they refused to leave their factories until management agreed to 

meet and negotiate fairly with their representatives. Roose
velt aided 
labor by refusing to send in troops to end the 
sit-
down strikes. With 
230 
a short history of the united states 
his active encouragement this new labor or
ganization
 expanded rap
-idly. By 
1941
 the CIO had a membership of nearly 
5 million, and the 
AFL a membership of a little over 
4.5 million. Later, in 
1955
, the two 
organizations merged. 
For all intents 
an
d purposes the New Deal program came to an 
end largely because of events transpiring both inside and outside the 
United States. Eu
rope had become a powder keg because of the eco
-nomic crisis that brought Adolf Hitler to power in Germany. Earlier, 

Beni
to Mussolini had established a fascist dictatorship in Italy, and 
Joseph Stalin had begun a tyrannical reign in the Soviet  
Union. These 
three dictators chose to intervene in a civil war that had broken out in 

Spain. Hitler and Mussolini provided military aid to the fascist army 

of General Francisco Franco, who had launched a war against Spain’s 

Republican regime. Stalin threw his support to the loyalists, and there 

was fear that this struggle between fascism and communism could 

widen into another world conﬂ
 ict. Roo 
sevelt seemed anxious to initiate 
some action by which collective security (that would “quarantine” na
-tions that threatened international stability) could be established. But a 

strong sense of isolationism still permeated the United States, and any 
movement toward collaborative action with Eu
rope guaranteed an im
-mediate and hostile response from a concerned electorate. The fear of 

com
munism was widespread, and any thought of radical ideas inﬁ
 ltrat
-ing this country and undermining fundamental American values 

br
ought demands for strengthening national defenses. So FDR scrapped 
any idea of collaborating with Europeans and instead focused his at
-tention on the military preparedness of the United States. In addition, 

he a
sked Congress to appropriate $
1 billion for defense and the build
-ing of a  
two- 
ocean navy. 
As the result of the mounting fear of communism, the  
Ho
use of 
Representatives established a committee on May 
26, 1938,
 to investigate 
“the extent, character, and objects of 
un-
American propaganda activi
-ties in the United States.” Martin Dies Jr., a Demo
crat
 from Texas and 
a rabid xenophobe and anti–New Dealer, headed this committee. He 

claimed that the Roo
sevelt administration was swarming with “Com
-munists, Socialists, and the ‘ordinary garden variety crackpots.’ ” Sec
-231 
The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
retary of the Interior Harold Ickes responded by calling Dies “the 
outstanding zany of American po
liti
cal history.” 
The hearings of the Dies Committee began in the summer of 
1938 
and concentrated on communist inﬁ
ltration into the country, com
-pletely neglecting any threat of fascism. Witnesses made many unsub
-stantiated accusations, and the accused rarely had the right of rebuttal. 

Durin
g the ﬁ
rst few days of the hearings something like 
640
 organiza
-tions, 
483
 newspapers, and 
280 labor  
unions  were cited as having com
-munist connections. At ﬁ
rs
t this committee was limited to eight 
months’ duration, but  
ever-
increasing concern around the country 
about the communist menace caused representatives to extend the 

committee each year until 
1945
, when it was renamed the  
House Com
-mittee on 
Un-Am
erican Activities. 
By the winter and spring of 
1938
–1939 Congress began to halt the 
further expansion of the New Deal by cutting the administration’s re
-
quests for additional relief appropriations, defeating a housing bill, and 

abol
ishing a proﬁ
ts tax. “For God’s sake,” several congressmen told the 
President’s press secretary, “don’t send us any more controversial legis
-lation.” And since FDR was not expected to run for a third term in 

1940, cong
ressmen no longer feared that he could harm them at the 
polls or command their loyalty through control of patronage. So rather 

than remain silent as they had done in the past, they now challenged 

him when they opposed his requests. 
The New Deal was also affected by developments in Europe. Chan
-cellor Hitler denounced the Treaty of Versailles, and in violation of 

th
at treaty began to rearm Germany. Great Britain and France did 
nothing to stop him. He then sent troops into the demilitarized Ger
-man Rhineland and concluded a military alliance with Italy and Japan. 

Fur
thermore, he invaded and occupied Austria, and signed a 
Nazi- 
Soviet Pact with Stalin. This pact allotted western Poland to 
Germany, and Rus
sia gained Estonia, Latvia, eastern Poland, Bessara
-bia, and later Lithuania. Then Hitler threatened to invade Czechoslo
-vak
ia if it did not surrender the Sudetenland, which had more than 
3 million inhabitants of German ancestry. No doubt encouraged by the 
criminal actions of his German ally, Benito Mussolini invaded Alba
-nia. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of Great Britain and Premier 

Edou
ard Daladier of France met with Hitler and Mussolini in Munich 
232 
a short history of the united states 
on September 
28, 1938
, and agreed to the dismemberment of Czecho
-slo
vak
ia. Chamberlain returned to Britain believing he had a guarantee 
of “peace in our time.” 
It is interesting but useless to contemplate what might have hap
-pened had Britain and France together stood up to Hitler and chal
-lenged his foreign adventures. But they feared provoking another world 

wa
r, so they remained silent, which only encouraged further assaults on 
the peace and stability of Eu
rope. 
In the United States there was a feeling that this country should re
-main aloof from any involvement in European affairs. America’s prior
-ity was achieving economic recovery, not “seeking monsters in the 

wor
ld to destroy.” There  
were or
ganized peace efforts around the coun
-try, reminding the nation’s leaders that the electorate opposed war and 

an
y entanglement with Eu
rope. The spirit of isolationism still per
-sisted, and the message was clearly understood in Washington. 
Then the situation suddenly changed. Hitler invaded Poland on Sep
-tember 
1, 1939
, and Britain and France declared war against Germany 
two days later. Stalin attacked Poland on September 
17 as part of his 
agreement with Hitler, and on September 
29 these two vultures parti
-tioned that hapless country. Stalin then invaded Finland on November 

30. To everyone’s surprise, the Soviet  
Un
ion could not defeat and absorb 
Finland, and so a peace treaty was signed between the two countries on 

March 
12, 1940. Meanwhile Roo 
sevelt called Congress into special ses
-sion on September 
21, 1939
, and asked that the arms embargo of the 
Neutrality Act of 
1937
, which forbade the sale of U.S. armaments to bel
-ligerent nations, be repealed so that Britain and France could purchase 

mi
litary equipment from America. The danger of this spreading conﬂ
 a-gration in Eu
ro
pe had become so acute that Congress acceded to FDR’s 
request and passed the Neutrality Act of 
1939
, by which it authorized 
“cash and carry” purchases of arms and munitions to belligerents. 
A quiet period in the Eu
ro
pean war followed, as Hitler prepared for 
a spring offensive. Newspapers called it the “phony war.” Then, suddenly, 

on April 
10, 1940, ﬁghting burst out in explosive violence as Germany 
launched a blitzkrieg, or lightning war, in which tanks, 
dive-
bombers, 
airborne troops, and motorized infantry raced across neutral countries 

and overran Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and 

France. British troops in France  
were hurriedly evacuated from the port 
233 The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
city of Dunkirk in late May. Over 
300
,000 British and French troops 
were rescued by 
861 ships of all sizes and types. Chamberlain resigned his 
ofﬁ
ce and was succeeded on May 
11 by Winston Churchill. Germany now 
occupied much of the Eu
ropean continent, including all of northern and 
western France, since Paris had fallen on June 
16 and the French govern
-ment had asked for an armistice. What was left of France was turned over 
to
 a hastily formed government centered in Vichy under a rabid anticom
-munist, the aged Marshal  
Hen
ri-
Philippe Pétain. Italy declared war 
against France and En
gland, and it was feared that the Nazis would 
launch an 
all-
out invasion of Great Britain from France and Norway. But 
Hitler turned his attention to the Balkans, overran Romania and Bul
-garia, and swept up Yugo 
slav
ia and Greece. 
Fearing that the United States would soon be drawn into the con-
ﬂ ic
t, Roo 
sevelt asked Congress for an appropriation of $
1.2 billion for 
defense and signed the ﬁ
rst Revenue Act of 
1940, which raised the fed
-eral debt limit to $
4 billion. He also asked for and received passage of 
the Selective Ser
vice Act (or draft) on September 
16, the ﬁ
 rst enacted 
in peacetime. This legislation provided for the registration of all males 

between the ages of 
twenty-
one and  
thirty-
ﬁve for a  
one-
year training 
program. The ﬁ
rst draftees  
were selected on October 
29. It was obvious that the United States was sympathetic to the Allies’ 
cause,
 and Roo 
sevelt acted accordingly. In September he transferred 
ﬁfty old but still ser
viceable American destroyers to Britain so that the 
Royal Navy could hunt Nazi submarines and convoy merchant ships 

safely across the oceans. In return the United States received the use of 

eight naval bases from Newfoundland to British Guiana. 
With a presidential election approaching in the fall of 
1940, bot
h major parties actively advocated increased aid to Great Britain. The 

Republicans had expected to nominate a staunch midwestern  anti- 

interventionist, such as Senators Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan or 

Robert A. Taft of Ohio. But Americans panicked over the demonstra
-tion of German military might as it powered its way across Eu
rope
 and 
brought about the collapse of the French government. So, at their con
-vention, the Republican delegates chose instead Wendell L. Willkie of 

Ne
w York, who was the president of an important utilities company and 
a former Demo
crat, who actively advocated additional aid to Britain. 
His running made was Senator Charles L. McNary of Oregon. 
234 
a short history of the united states 
FDR let it be known that he would accept nomination for a third 
term, e
ven though it would violate the  
two-
term tradition begun by 
George Washington. The Demo
crats really had little choice. The ex
-tremely pop
ul
ar President enjoyed national support and could not be 
denied. He was nominated unanimously on the ﬁ
rst ballot. He then 
chose the left-leaning Secretary of Agriculture, Henry A. Wallace, to 
run for the vice presidency. 
At ﬁrst there was little difference between the two presidential can
-didates during the campaign, in both domestic and foreign  
po
licy. In 
fact, Willkie approved the draft and the transfer of the destroyers to 

Great Britain. Not until he accused Roo se
velt of leading the country 
into war did he attempt to differ with FDR’s record. The President 

responded by assuring the American people that he would not send 

Americans into any foreign wars. 
The election brought another triumph for Roo 
sevelt. H
e won a third 
term by capturing a plurality of nearly 
5 million pop
ular votes (down 
from 
11 million in 
1936
) and a majority of 
449
 electoral votes. Willkie 
won  
forty-
ﬁve percent of the pop 
ular vote but carried only ten states, 
for a total of 
82 electoral votes. 
In early December 1940
, F
DR received a request from Winston 
Churchill. The letter explained Britain’s urgent need for munitions, 

airplanes, and other military supplies to carry on the war but admit
-ted that the British government did not have the money to pay for 

th
em. Because of the mounting submarine attacks by the Germans, 
Britain desperately needed American help in order to keep the North 

Atlantic supply lines open. Roo 
sevelt solved the problem by devising 
a lend-
lease program. He held a press conference on December 
17, followed by a ﬁ
reside chat over the radio twelve days later, in which 
he explained to the American people the absolute need to lend or 

lease equipment and supplies to Britain for victory over the forces of 

fascism. “We must be the great arsenal of democracy,” he declared. 

He concluded his ﬁ
reside chat by saying, “I call upon our people with 
absolute conﬁ
dence that our common cause will greatly succeed.” He 
made it clear that by this action this country fully committed itself to 

the defeat of Germany. 
235 The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
The 
Lend-
Lease Bill was introduced in Congress in early January 
1941
, and after a long and full debate it passed both 
houses overwhelm
-ingly by March 
11. Roo sevelt sig
ned it immediately and then asked for $
7 billion to purchase the materials; his request was approved. The 
Lend-
Lease Act of 
1941
 allowed any nation whose defense the President 
deemed vital to American interests to receive arms, munitions, and any 

other supplies and equipment by sale, transfer, exchange, or lease. The 

President also asked Congress for support of those nations who  
were ﬁghting in defense of what he called the Four Freedoms: freedom of 
speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. 
Although Roo 
sevelt still hoped to keep the United States out of the 
war, he was certainly willing to do what
ever was necessary to ensure 
Germany’s defeat. Even when German U-boats attacked and sank 

American destroyers with a loss of lives, he did not go to Congress and 

ask for a declaration of war. But he did publicly denounce the “pirati
-cal” acts of German submarines, and he ordered American naval ves
-sels to shoot on sight any U-boat that appeared in waters west of 

Ic
eland. Furthermore, when Germany invaded the Soviet  
Union on 
June 
21, 1941
, he immediately assured the Soviets that they would re
-ceive lend-
lease a
ssistance with all due dispatch. Roo se
velt gave Hitler 
every excuse possible to declare war against the United States, but the 

dictator did not have the will or the armies to take on such an adver
-sary. His forces 
were fu
lly occupied elsewhere. 
In August 
1941
, Roo sevelt a
nd Churchill met aboard the USS 
Au-gusta
 off the coast of Newfoundland and agreed on eight principles 
that would form a better future for mankind. This Atlantic Charter, 
as it was labeled, called for a restoration of the people’s right to govern 

themselves without dictators. It also called for freedom of the seas, a 

peace with justice, equal access to raw materials for all nations, and an 

end of the armaments race. 
As ea rly a s 1931
 Ja
pan began its military aggression against China 
and took control of the southern region of Manchuria. It then set up a 
puppet regime in September 
1932
 called Manchukuo. After entering an 
alliance with Germany and Italy (the Triple Alliance), thereby becom
-ing a member of the Axis powers, it pledged mutual assistance in the 
236 
a short history of the united states 
event of war. With designs on French Indochina, Japan then signed an 
ag
reement with the Vichy government in France that allowed the Japa
-nese to establish military bases in Indochina. 
The renewed aggressiveness of the Japa
ne
se in Asia prompted Roo
-sevelt to issue a sharp warning to Japan on July 
26, 1941, by renouncing 
the  
Japa
nese-
American Commercial Treaty of 
1911
 and halting all ship
-ments of steel and scrap iron to countries outside the western hemi
-sphere, except Great Britain. This embargo was aimed directly at 

Ja
pan, and it was deeply resented. Indeed, General Hideki Tojo and 
other Japa
nese militarists regarded it as a hostile act. Since half the oil, 
steel, and iron that Japan needed to maintain its economy came from 

the United States, something had to be done to restore trade relations 

between the two countries if Japan was to remain a viable modern, in
-dustrial state. It tried negotiating, offering one concession after an
-other, such as promising not to attack the Soviet  
Un
ion and giving 
assurances that it would not be bound by the Triple Alliance to declare 

war against the United States if America went to war with Germany. 

But Secretary of State Cordell Hull demanded more. He wanted Japan 

out of China, which was totally unacceptable. In turn the Japanese in
-sisted that the United States cease giving aid to the new Chinese leader, 

Chi
ang 
Kai-
shek, something Hull refused to do. 
An impasse ensued, whereupon the Japa
ne
se turned to violence as a 
solution. On November 
20, 1941
, an 
aircraft-
carrier strike force under the 
command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto set out from Japan and headed 

for the Hawaiian Islands, maintaining radio silence for the entire jour
-ney. On Sunday morning, December 
7, th
ree waves of aerial bombers 
from the carriers attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor. 

Taken completely by surprise despite several warnings that the Japa
nese 
might launch an assault, the administration failed to notify army and 

navy commanders in Hawaii of the possibility and as a result American 

forces on the island suffered crippling losses. Nineteen ships  were sunk 

or disabled, including eight battleships. Over 
100
 airplanes 
were de-stroyed, and more than 
2,000 me
n killed. The Japa
nese also struck naval 
and air bases in the Philippines, Guam, Midway, Hong Kong, and the 

Malay Peninsula. Indeed, the American air force in the Philippines was 

virtually annihilated when its planes on the ground 
were hit at their base 

near Manila. Clearly, neither the leaders in Washington nor the com
-237 
The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
manders in the ﬁ
eld understood the military capability of the Japa
nese. 
Roosevelt, Hull, and General Douglas MacArthur, commander of the 
armed forces in the Philippines, had no idea of the intentions of the Japa
-nese, and as a consequence the United States suffered the most devastat
-ing military defeat in its entire history up to that time. 
Roosevelt had just ﬁ
nished lunch when Secretary of War Henry L. 
Stimson informed him of the attack at Pearl Harbor. The President im
-mediately summoned the leaders in Congress to meet with him that eve
-ning. The next day he appeared before a joint session. He mounted the 
ro
strum, supported by his son James, a member of the lower chamber, and 
addressed the assembled members, cabinet ofﬁ
cers, Supreme Court jus
-tices, and a large number of men of the foreign diplomatic corps. 
“Yesterday,” the  
determ
ined-
toned President began, “December 
7, 1941
—a date which will live in 
infamy—the United States of America 
was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the 

Empire of Japan
. . . . I ask that Congress declare that since the unpro
-voked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December seventh, a 

stat
e of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese 
Empire.” 
When the joint session ended at 
12:40 PM, t
he Senate returned to 
its chamber and unanimously voted for war. In the  House the resolu
-tion would have been unanimous save for the negative vote of Jeannette 

Ra
nkin of Montana, who had also voted against a declaration of war in 
1917
. The resolutions from both 
houses 
were rushed to Roo 
sevelt, who 
signed them at 
4:10 PM. Three days later, on December 
11, both Ger
-many and Italy, in compliance with the Triple Treaty, declared war on 

th
e United States. On the same day Congress replied with similar dec
-larations, and this time Rankin simply voted “present.” 
General George Marshall, who had been serving as Army Chief of 
Sta
ff since 
1939,
 continued in the position until the end of the war. 
Admiral Ernest J. King was chosen Chief of Naval Operations. Later 

Marshall and King each received the new  
ﬁ ve-star rank of General of 
the Army and Admiral of the Fleet, respectively. 
The anger, ou tr age, 
an
d thirst for revenge by Americans 
against the Japa
nese on account of the “dastardly” attack on Pearl 
238 
a short history of the united states 
Harbor were so intense that 
Japa
nese-
American citizens living prin
-cipally along the West Coast suffered the same fate that befell 
Na
tive Americans over a century before. They were removed. Con
-gressmen from California, Oregon, and Washington joined other 

publ
ic ofﬁ
cials, newspapers, and various pressure groups and com
-plained that the West Coast of the United States was vulnerable to 

in
vasion and demanded that Japa
nese aliens and 
Japa
nese-
American 
citizens be expelled from their homes and relocated to the interior. 

Roosevelt responded by issuing an executive order in February and 
March 
1942
, authorizing the secretary of war to designate certain 
areas as restricted military zones from which “unacceptable” indi
-viduals would be excluded. More than 
100
,000 people of Japa
nese 
descent, including 
Japa
nese-
American citizens, living along the 
West Coast and in Arizona  
were removed to what can only be de
-scribed as concentration camps in the interior. This disgraceful ac
-tion caused these people to lose homes, businesses, farms, and most 

of
 their possessions. On March 
21, 1942
, Congress approved the ac
-tion. Without debate, both 
ho
uses unanimously passed a mea
sure 
making it a crime to violate military orders in restricted military 

zones, thus becoming an accomplice to this massive violation of the 

basic rights of American citizens. The Supreme Court also became a 

party to this move. It upheld the action as a means of ensuring na
-tional security, the same argument Andrew Jackson had given for 

th
e removal of American Indians. 
Nonetheless, thousands of 
Japa
nese-
American men in these camps 
volunteered to ﬁ
ght against Japan and Germany. Taking no chances, 
the administration sent most of them to Eu
rope. However, when they 
returned home as decorated war veterans many of them could not re
-cover their lost property or jobs. 
Mexican-
Americans also suffered, especially those in California. 
They 
were victims of urban violence, culminating in the  
so-called “Zoot
-suit war” of 
1943
 in Los Angeles, when mobs of ser
vicemen roamed and 
assaulted and robbed at will young  
Mexican-
Americans. War 
time can 
bring out not only the best but frequently the worst characteristics of any 

society, and in both areas the United States was no exception. 
There was a sense throughout America that the war was justiﬁ
 ed a
nd 
right. Fighting the evil of Nazism, Fascism, and militarism in the world 
239 
The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
so that people could live freely under governments they themselves chose 
prompted many young men to enlist in the armed services after Pearl 

Harbor. The Selective Ser
vice boards around the country registered 
about 
31 million, of whom 
10 million 
were inducted into ser
vice. And the 
Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps Act, sponsored by Representative Edith 

Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts, passed in May 
1942
 and created up to 
150
,000 noncombatant positions (mostly nurses) for women within the 
army. This corps was intended, said Rogers, to give “women a chance to 

volunteer to serve their country in a patriotic way.” Almost 
350,000 women served in the WAACs, the WAVEs, and similar groups in other 

military branches. A total of more than 
15 million American men and 
women participated in World War II, of whom 
10 million served in the 
army, 
3.5 million in the navy, nearly 
600,000 in the marines, and 
240
,000 in the Coast Guard. This was the largest mobilization of manpower in 

U.S. 
history. Sadly, some 
253,573
 died during the war, and 
651
,042 
were wounded, 
253
,573
 missing, and 
114
,205
 taken prisoner. 
Of necessity, the war vastly increased the powers of the chief execu
-tive. His involvement in and control of foreign and domestic policy was 

ex
pected by both the electorate and Congress. On December 
16, 1941
, the First War Powers Act was approved, followed on March 
22, 1942
, by the Second War Powers Act, which authorized the President “to 

make such redistribution of functions among executive agencies as he 

may deem necessary” to prosecute the war. The cost of the war ran into 

the billions, and the Secretary of the Trea
sury Henry Morgenthau in 
March 
1942
 asked for $
56 billion for defense out of a budget of $
59 bil
-lion. The Revenue Act of 
1941 had raised taxes to a level that brought 
in revenues of $
13 billion, the largest single revenue bill in the nation’s 
history up to that time. But the Revenue Act of 
1942
 went farther, rais
-ing the excess proﬁ
t ta
x from sixty to ninety percent and the income 
tax from four to six percent and imposing a “victory tax” of ﬁ
 ve percent 
on those with a gross income over $
624
. Furthermore, it lowered ex
-emption levels to the point where they produced millions of new tax
-payers. In fact, this act has been described as the income tax that 

tra
nsformed a “class tax” to a “mass tax.” Between 
1941
 and 
1945
, the 
cost of the war came to $
321 billion, a little over half of which was 
borrowed. Consequently, the national debt  
rose from $
49 billion in 
1941
 to $
259
 billion in 
1945
. 240 a short history of the united states 
On January 
13, 1942, 
Roosevelt a
ppointed Donald M. Nelson to 
head the War Production Board, which would mobilize the nation’s 
vast 
resources so that the war could be brought to a speedy conclusion. 
The Ofﬁ
ce of Production Management, under William S. Knudson, 
had been established on December 
29, 1941
, to coordinate defense pro
-duction to supply Great Britain and its allies with needed materials, as 

well a
s the Ofﬁ
 ce of Scientiﬁ
 c Research and Development on June 
28, 1941
. Price controls and rationing  
were established along with the Of
-ﬁces of Economic Stabilization, Censorship, War Information, and 
Strategic Ser
vices. 
And it is truly amazing what American industry produced in terms 
of w
ar
time matériel, resulting from unlimited governmental credit, the 
high demand for these products, and the effective or
ganization neces
-sary to achieve the desired results. American factories produced 
75,000 tan
ks; 
275,000 military aircraft; and 
650,000 pieces of artillery. Amer
-ican shipyards built 
55.24 mi
llion tons of merchant shipping. Perhaps 
no other national economy was managed so efﬁ
ciently and successfully. 
In addition, as a result of the Ofﬁ
 ce of Scientiﬁ
 c Research and Devel
-opment, American scientists, with the help of their British colleagues, 

in
vented radar, by which ships and planes could be detected from afar. 
Most important of all was the development of the atom bomb. The 
Man
hattan Project, under the direction of Brigadier General Leslie R. 
Groves, was set up to secretly build this crucial weapon. It was a crash 

program to create the atomic bomb before the Germans perfected one. 

Considering the long head start the Germans enjoyed in perfecting 

advanced weaponry, it is astounding that the Americans succeeded in 

their quest and the Germans did not. Had the Germans succeeded, the 

war might have ended differently. The three bombs produced by the 

Manhattan Project cost $
2 billion. The ﬁ
rst of them was tested on July 
16, 1945
, at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and a  
whole new world began. 
Meanwhile, the war 
in Eu
rope expanded when Hungary and 
Romania joined the Axis powers, and Italy had invaded Greece with 

German help and forced its capitulation on April 
27, 1941
. En
gland 
endured an agony of daily air raids forcing Londoners to seek shelter in 

subways and other underground facilities. Germany penetrated deep 
241 
The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
into the Soviet  
Union and laid siege to Leningrad. Far worse, the yet 
generally unknown but systematic extermination of Jews had begun in 
the gas chambers of Auschwitz, Poland. 
The ﬁ
rst massive Eu
ropean operation in which American troops 
participated was the command in North Africa to drive out the Italians 

and Germans. Hitler’s Afrika Corps, under Field Marshal Erwin 

Rommel, fought the British for control of Egypt, and American tanks 

arrived just in time to stop the Nazis from advancing. Then, in Octo
-
ber 1942
, the British general Sir Bernard Montgomery and his army 
launched a counteroffensive and defeated Rommel at El Alamein. The 

following month a massive  
Anglo-
American army under General 
Dwight D. Eisenhower brought about a surrender by the Germans on 

May 
12, 1943
, after a long and bitter struggle. The entire Mediterra
-nean area from Gibraltar to the Suez Canal was now under Allied 

con
trol. Meanwhile the Rus
sians captured an entire German army at 
Sta
lin
grad and lifted the siege of Leningrad. 
From Africa, an 
Anglo-
Am
erican force consisting of General Mont-
gomery’s Eighth Army and General George S. Patton’s Seventh Army 

invaded Sicily on July 
10, 1943
, and after heavy ﬁ
ghting subdued the 
island on August 
17. Then, on September 
3, 1943
, the Allied force 
crossed the strait and landed on the toe of the Italian peninsula. They 

also struck at Salerno, below Naples, and Anzio, near Rome, again 

encountering ﬁ
 erce re
sistance by the Germans. Not until June 
4, 1944
, did the Allies capture Rome. Mussolini was overthrown and captured 

but was rescued by the Germans and taken to Lake Como in the north, 

where he attempted to form a government. In this struggle to occupy 

Italy the Americans suffered more than 
70,000 casualties. 
In Asia the Japa
nese seized Guam, Hong Kong, Singapore, Burma, 
Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, 

and the Philippines within six months of declaring war. General Mac
-Arthur managed to escape from the Philippines but promised to re
-turn. As a result of these many victories, Japan commanded the western 

hal
f of the Paciﬁ
c Ocean and expanded its territorial conquests to more 
than a thousand miles in southeast Asia. 
But then the war in the Paciﬁ
c took a turn for the better for the 
Am
ericans with the ﬁrst major defeat of Japa
nese naval forces. A large 
ﬂeet of aircraft carriers and other warships under the command of 
242 
a shor t h istory of th e united stat es 
Admiral Yamamoto headed for Midway Island, a base of strategic im
-portance because of its location 
1,000 mi
les northwest of the Hawaiian 
Islands. For the United States, the capture of Midway by the Japa
nese 
would have been catastrophic. But American experts had broken the 
Japa
nese code, and a ﬂ
eet under Admiral Chester Nimitz lay in wait. 
In a titanic battle that lasted from June 
3 to June 
6, 1942
, torpedo 
bombers from the U.S. aircraft carriers 
Yorktown
, Hornet
, and 
Enter
-prise
 decimated the Japa
nese ﬂ
eet, sinking four aircraft carriers, a heavy 
cruiser, and three destroyers, and shooting down or destroying 
275 air
-planes. Yamamoto retreated with what remained of his ﬂ
eet.
 This bat
-tle stopped the eastward advance of the Japa
ne
se, rescued Hawaii from 
possible invasion, and restored the balance of naval power in the Paciﬁ
 c to American hands. 
Then began a period of successful “island hopping,” with the inva
-sion of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in August 
1942
, Tarawa in 
the Gilberts in November 
1943
, Guam and Saipan in 
1944
, and Iwo 
Jima in March 
1945.
 The following  
month—April 
1945
—marines in
-vaded Okinawa and captured it on June 
21. Am
erican forces 
were now 
poised only 
350 miles from Japan itself. The U.S. Paciﬁ
 c ﬂ
 eet consisted 
of 24 battleships, 
26 cruisers, 
64 escort carriers, 
323
 destroyers, and 
15,000 combat airplanes. 
On October 
20, 1944
, General MacArthur began an invasion of the 
Philippines. From October 
23 to 25 the naval battle of Leyte Gulf took 
place. It was the last and greatest naval battle of the war. It extended 

over hundreds of miles and involved 
35 large and small aircraft carriers, 
21 battleships, 
35 cruisers, hundreds of destroyers, submarines, motor 
torpedo boats, and more than 
1,500
 aircraft in four separate engage
-ments. The American forces could have been annihilated because Ad
-miral Halsey and his Third Fleet had been lured away to the north, 

leavi
ng Admiral Clifton Sprague to protect the invasion of the Philip
-pines, but the Japa
nes
e suddenly withdrew from the battle after losing 
4 carriers, 
2 battleships, 
9 cruisers, and 
9 destroyers. The American 
forces then invaded Luzon, the principal island of the Philippines, and 

captured Manila on February 
23, 1945
. In January 
1943 Roo sevelt met with Winston Churchill in Casa
-blanca and agreed to demand “unconditional surrender” by Germany 

as t
he only acceptable terms for ending the war. Achieving that goal 
243 
The Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II 
began with the invasion of Italy, followed on June 
6, 1944
, with a mas
-sive invasion of France by American and British troops, called Opera
-tion Overlord, under the command of General Eisenhower. Some 
176
,000 Allied troops aboard 
4,000 landing craft, supported by 
600 warships and an air cover of 
10,000 planes, crossed the En
glish Chan
-nel; landed along a 
ﬁ fty
-nine-
mile stretch of the Normandy coastline
; and began the recapture of Europe. It was the greatest amphibious 

landing operation ever undertaken, and it faced stiff opposition by a 

strong German defense. Weeks of heavy ﬁ
ghting followed before the 
Allies broke through and occupied Paris on August 
25. Six Allied armies, 
totaling more than 
2 million men, slammed their way to the Siegfried 
Line, smashed it, and crossed the Rhine River on March 
7, 1945
. Meanwhile, FDR had won a fourth term as President the previous 
No
vember when he and his running mate, Senator Harry S. Truman of 
Missouri, defeated Governor Thomas Dewey of New York and Gover
-nor John W. Bricker of Ohio by capturing over 
26 mi
llion popular and 
432
 electoral votes, against 
22 million pop
ular votes and  
99 electoral 
votes for Dewey. The choice of Truman for Vice President resulted 

from his superb handling of a Senate committee investigating the Na
-tional Defense Program. He was a devoted and knowledgeable student 

of A
merican history who did not wish his committee to be guilty of the 
blunders committed during the Civil War by the Joint Committee on 

the Conduct of the War. 
On the eastern front, the Soviets had launched a counteroffensive, 
fo
llowing a meeting of FDR, Churchill, and Stalin in Tehran, Iran, on 
November 
28, 1943
, that reafﬁ
rmed Stalin’s commitment to enter the 
war against Japan and establish an international union to keep the 

peace after the war. The Soviets lifted the siege of Leningrad, recap
-tured Sta 
lin
grad, and drove the Germans out of Rus
sia. 
In another action to address possible problems once the war ended, 
Cong
ress passed the Ser
vicemen’s Readjustment Act of 
1944
, better 
known as the G.I. Bill of Rights, which authorized the Veterans Ad
-ministration to assist veterans of World War II in readjusting to civil
-ian life by providing academic training, medical assistance, loans, and 

emp
loyment programs. It was an immediate success. Within ten years 
more than half of all World War II veterans had taken advantage of 

one or more of the many beneﬁ
ts provided by the G.I. Bill. 
244 a short history of the united states 
Meanwhile, the Allied forces drove across Eu
ro
pe, and Germany 
was subjected to constant and devastating air raids. Roo se
velt, 
Churchill, and Stalin met in Yalta on February 
4–11, 1945
, to plan the 
shape of Eu
rope and the division of Germany after the war. Two 
months later, on April 
12, 1945
, FDR died of a ce 
rebral hemorrhage in 
Warm Springs, Georgia. The elevation of Harry Truman to the presi
-dency came just as Soviet forces 
were about t
o launch an assault on 
Berlin, something Churchill had pleaded with Eisenhower to prevent. 
The British Prime Minister wanted the Allied powers to occupy Ber
-lin, but Eisenhower rejected the plea for military reasons. The general 

fe
lt it was more important to prevent the escape of the German army to 
mountain strongholds in Bavaria. The capture of Berlin was not worth 

the loss of American and British lives, he argued. The German capital 

fell to the Rus
sians on May 
2, Hitler committed suicide, and on May 
7 his successor, Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, ordered all German naval 

and land forces to surrender. The unconditional surrender was signed 

by German delegates at Eisenhower’s headquarters the following day 

in the city of Rheims. 
On July 
28, 1945, the Senate ratiﬁ
ed the United Nations Charter, 
which committed the United States to a policy of internationalism, and 

the United Nations ofﬁ
 cially began its operations on October 
24, 1945
. Although isolationism in the United States had not vanished com
-pletely, a larger number of Americans now believed the nation could 

no
t escape its responsibility in keeping the peace around the world. 
Rus sia ﬁnally declared war against Japan on August 
8 and invaded 
Manchuria. When the United States, Britain, and China demanded 

that Japan surrender unconditionally, the demand was rejected. Where
-
upon Truman ordered that the ﬁ
rs
t atom bomb be dropped on the 
military base and city of Hiroshima. The bombing occurred on August 

6, killing and injuring over 
160
,000 people. Three days later a second 
atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, wiping out the city. 
And that did it. On August 
14, th
e Japa
nese accepted unconditional 
surrender, but  
were permitted to retain their emperor, subject to the 
orders of the supreme commander of Allied forces in the Far East, 

General Douglas MacArthur. 
Thus ended one of the most destructive  wars—if not the most de
-structive  
war—in world history. 
9The Cold War and Civil Rights
Shortly before the
 end of World War II, Harry Truman 
delivered his ﬁ
rst address as President to a joint session of Con
-gress in which he promised to defend the ideals advanced by FDR and 
br
ing an end to “Hitler’s ghastly threat to dominate the world.” Shortly 
thereafter, Mussolini was captured and hanged by Italian partisans, 

and Hitler killed himself in his bunker in Berlin. “The armies of lib
-eration,” to use Truman’s phrase, had defeated fascism, but one danger 

to wo
rld peace still remained: communism. And fear of communism 
and its possible spread into the free world intensiﬁ
ed in the United 
States for the next several de 
cades. It became the leading issue in shap
-ing both domestic and foreign policy. 
The  
House of Representatives converted the Dies Committee into 
the Committee on 
Un-American Activities in 
1945
, and this commit
-tee, under Demo
cr
atic control during the  
Seventy-
Ninth Congress, 
avoided controversy. But when the Republicans won a majority in the 

House following the midterm election of 
1946, the chairman of the 
Un-American Activities Committee, Parnell Thomas of New Jersey, 
conducted hearings, in October 
1947
, into the motion picture industry 
and made almost daily headlines in the newspapers. Movie stars and 

studio executives appeared before the committee and  were asked to 

name those persons they knew who had joined the Communist Party. 

Ten accused screenwriters and producers  were asked about their afﬁ
 li-ation with subversive organizations. The “Hollywood Ten” they were 

called, and they challenged the right of the committee to inquire into 
246 a short history of the united states 
their po
liti
cal beliefs and refused to answer. Convicted of contempt of 
Congress, they 
were added to a blacklist, jailed, and denied employ
-ment. This blacklist was later expanded to include radio and tele
vision 
performers. 
In August 
1948
, Ri
chard Nixon of California, a freshman member 
of the committee, launched a celebrated investigation of Whittaker 

Chambers, an editor of 
Time
 magazine and a former communist, who 
accused Alger Hiss, a distinguished former State Department ofﬁ
 cial, 
of allegedly providing him with secret government documents, docu
-ments hidden away in a pumpkin shell. Hiss denied the charge. The 

com
mittee could not determine which of the two men was lying, but 
Hiss was later convicted of perjury. 
Abroad, the communist menace spread westward. The Soviet  
Un
ion controlled and dominated Eastern Eu
rope and occupied the German 
territory surrounding the city of Berlin. Earlier, the city had been di
-vided into four zones, each controlled by one of the four major powers: 

th
e Soviet  
Union, France, En
gland, and the United States. In a speech 
in Fulton, Missouri, on March 
15, 1946, Winston Churchill declared 
that “from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Atlantic, an Iron Cur
-tain has descended across the Continent.” The Western powers contin
-ued to urge the establishment in Eastern Eu
rope
 of governments 
elected by the people, but Stalin had no intention of allowing the cre
-ation of new, possibly hostile, governments along the Russian border. 
He went further. In an effort to drive the West completely out of 
Berl
in he shut off all trafﬁ
c into the city on July 
24, 1948
. Truman re
-sponded by airlifting supplies of food, fuel, and other necessities into 

Berl
in. From July 
1948
 to September 
1949
, with the British and French 
cooperating, about 
2.5 million tons of supplies 
were ﬂown to the city in 
an around-
the- 
clock operation. 
A Cold War, as distinct from a hot one, now existed between the 
fr
ee world and the Soviet  
Union. Then, on September 
24, 1949
, it be
-come known that the Soviets had detonated an atom bomb, largely 

const
ructed using secret information stolen from the United States and 
Great Britain by citizens of both countries who had communist lean
-ings or had indeed joined the Communist Party. The world had sud
-denly become very dangerous, especially if the antagonists ever began 

to
 hurl atomic bombs at each other. In response, Truman announced 
247 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
that the United States would undertake the development and produc
-tion of an even more terrible weapon, the hydrogen bomb. The annihi
-lation of civilization had now become a real possibility. 
In recognition of the new world that had dawned with the arrival of 
nu
clear weaponry, Congress enacted the Atomic Energy Act on Au
-gust 
1, 1946, tr
ansferring authority over atomic energy from the War 
Department, which had developed the bomb, to a civilian committee 
of ﬁ
ve members appointed by the President. Overseeing the activities 
of this committee was a Joint Commission on Atomic Energy consist
-ing of nine members from the  
Ho
use appointed by the Speaker and nine 
members from the Senate appointed by the president of the Senate. 
The United States also agreed to the twelve-
nat
ion North Atlantic 
Treaty, ratiﬁ
ed on July 
21, 1949
, which declared that an attack on any 
one member nation would be considered an attack upon all. The twelve 

nations included Britain, France, Spain, Canada, Belgium, Luxem
-bourg, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, and Ice
-land. In addition, this treaty established the North Atlantic Treaty 

Orga
ni 
zation (NATO), headed by a council to draw up plans for the 
defense of the member nations. Later, in 
1952
, Greece and Turkey joined 
NATO. It was an historic agreement for the United States. This was the 

ﬁrst time the country had joined a peacetime Eu
ropean alliance. 
On the domestic 
fr
ont the end of the war witnessed an explosion 
of economic demand. Four years of sacriﬁ
ce had made Americans hun
-gry for all the goods and services that had been denied them for so 

lo
ng. Individual and corporate savings approached $
50 billion. Unfor
-tunately, there  
were no
t enough homes, automobiles, appliances, and 
other commodities to go around. Demand outstripped supply, causing 

prices to skyrocket. Then, when Congress reduced taxes by some $
6 billion, it only provided additional money in the hands of consumers, 

which added to the pressure. 
When the G.I.’s returned home they 
were eager t
o resume their ci
-vilian lives, but they had trouble ﬁ
nd
ing adequate housing or adequate 
living conditions. Many of them began or returned to college to com
-plete their education, thanks to the G.I. Bill. Others pursued profes
-sional degrees or borrowed money to purchase homes where available. 
248 
a short history of the united states 
A housing boom resulted in which new communities, such as Levit
-town in New York, sprang up. 
Labor demanded increased wages.  
Un
ions boasted nearly 
15 million 
members, and their leaders  
were determined to seek higher wages sufﬁ
 -cient to maintain the level necessary to meet the rising cost of living. The 
rai
lroad  
union began a strike that threatened to paralyze the country, 
whereupon Truman seized the railroads on May 
17, 1946, and offered a 
compromise settlement that eigh
teen unions accepted. But the engineers 
and trainmen did not accept it, so the President asked Congress to grant 

him the power to declare a state of national emergency whenever a strike 

in a vital industry under federal control threatened national security. 

Strikers would be drafted into the army, they would lose their se
niority, 
and the leaders would be ﬁ
ned and jailed. The  
House of Representatives 
passed the mea
sure, but the Senate did not follow suit, because by that 
time the striking workers had returned to their jobs. 
To further complicate the labor situation, John L. Lewis led his 
United Mine Workers out on strike for higher wages and improved 
working conditions. When negotiations failed, the mines  
were seized. 
A new contract was signed granting most of Lewis’s demands, but in 

October 
1946 he made new ones. The government refused to budge, 
supported by a federal judge’s injunction. Lewis deﬁ
ed the in
junction 
and called another strike, which resulted in a ﬁ
ne of $
10,000 against 
himself and $
3.5 million against the  union. Another contract was 
agreed upon that conceded most of Lewis’s demands, and the problem 

was ﬁ
nally resolved in June 
1947
. But the anger toward 
unions boiled over in Congress after the Re
-publicans won control in the midterm election of 
1946. In Ju
ne 
1947
, the 
Taft-
Hartley Act, considered by some members as “the most vicious, 
restrictive and destructive  anti-labor bill ever brought before the  
House,” 
was enacted. Truman vetoed it, but Congress overrode his objection. 

This legislation outlawed the closed shop, in which only  union mem
-bers could be hired by employers; forbade “unfair” 
un
ion practices such 
as secondary boycotts and jurisdictional strikes; permitted employers 

to sue  
unions for damages caused by strikes; required 
cooling- 
off peri
-ods and temporary injunctions to be issued by the President when na
-tional health and safety 
were con
cerned; and forbade  
unions from 
contributing to po
liti
cal parties. The act had a tremendous impact on 
249 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
the voting habits of 
union members. Those who had voted Republican 
in the past now switched to the Demo
cratic Party. 
Th e Co ld Wa r 
betwe
en the Soviet  
Union and the West intensi
-ﬁed in early 
1947
, when the Rus
sians lent their support to a  
communist-
led 
rebellion against the Greek government and demanded territory from 
Turkey and the right to construct naval bases in the Bosporus. Presi
-dent Truman responded promptly by asking Congress to appropriate 

$400
 million for military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey. “I 
believe,” he declared, in what would be called the Truman Doctrine, 

“that it must be the foreign policy of the United States to support free 

peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities 

or by outside pressures.” Through an amendment proposed by Senator 

Arthur H. Vandenberg to the effect that the United States would with
-draw its aid to Greece and Turkey when the Security Council of the 

Un
ited Nations gave evidence that it could act and resolve the matter, 
the Greek and Turkish Aid mea
sure passed Congress overwhelmingly 
in May 
1947
. This bill marked a radical departure from traditional 
American foreign policy. It was a clear statement that the United States 

would not stand idly by as Eu
rope attempted to recover from World 
War II and the Soviet  
Union sought to expand its power and inﬂ
 uence 
worldwide. Truman’s speech deﬁ
 ned the communist threat as a global 
danger and became the future rationale for U.S. military intervention 

in both Eu
rope and Southeast Asia. The assistance given to both Tur
-key and Greece helped those countries ﬁ
ght off Rus
sian pressure, and 
the Greek civil war ended in 
1949
. But the  
near-
disasters that had developed in Turkey and Greece 
could not compare to the problem facing the countries of Western Eu
-rope. France, En
gla
nd, Italy, and Germany, among others, faced bank
-ruptcy, and in France and Italy their dire predicament was a clear signal 

of a p
ossible communist takeover. The United States had already pro
-vided some assistance in the form of loans, but it was not enough. The 

ne
w Secretary of State, George C. Marshall, then devised a plan, 
which he outlined in a speech at Harvard University on June 
5, 1947
, by which the United States would assist Eu
ropean nations to rebuild their 
shattered economies, provided they came up with a comprehensive 
250 
a short history of the united states 
recovery program. He said that his plan was directed not against any 
par
tic ular country or ideology, but “against hunger, poverty, despera
-tion and chaos.” Representatives from sixteen Eu
ro
pean countries met 
in Paris and established the Committee for Eu
ropean Economic 
Cooperation, which worked out a master plan for the reconstruction of 

Europe’s ﬁ
nancial base that required between $
16.4 billion and $
22.4 billion from the United States. Naturally Russia condemned the 

proposed Marshall Plan as an obvious ploy by the United States to ad
-vance its imperialistic ambitions, and it forbade its satellite states from 

par
ticipating. 
For ten months Congress debated the Eu
rope
an Recovery Program 
(ERP) but what turned the tide in favor of the bill was the seizure in 

February 
1948
 of Czech 
oslo
vak
ia by that country’s Communists, and 
the mea
sure passed overwhelmingly on March 
31. Truman signed it on 
April 
3. Between April 
1948
 and December 
1951
, the United States con
-tributed a little over $
12 bil
lion to Eu
rope through the Economic Coop
-eration Administration. By 
195
1 Europe had not only achieved its prewar 
level of production but its level of industrial production rose to virtually 

guarantee genuine prosperity for the future. At the same time the com
-munist countries throughout eastern Eu
ro
pe had shriveled econom
-ical
ly, due in large measure to the fact that the Soviets carted off to 
Rus sia whatever materials would enhance their own economic needs. 
Inasmuch as the three Allied zones constituting West Germany  were 
consi
dered the industrial center of Eu
rope and therefore the key to the 
continent’s recovery, and inasmuch as the Soviet  
Union had refused to 
settle the German situation, the United States and its allies agreed to 

consolidate their zones and include it in the ERP. So they went ahead 

and established a West German Federal Republic in June 
1948
. Despite the statesmanlike actions taken by Truman in confronting 
th
e Soviet threat during the Berlin airlift, he suffered a steep decline in 
personal popularity. He was seen as an accidental president who failed 

to meet the standards set by his pre 
deces sor. Even more devastating 
was the internal disorder of the Demo
cratic Party. The President was 

battered by both the right and the left, and this situation gave the Re
-publicans great hope that they could capture both Congress and the 

pr
esidency in the election of 
1948
. On the right, southern Demo
crats 
were angry over the fact that Truman had appointed a Civil Rights 
251 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
Committee in 
1946 and had urged Congress to enact the committee’s 
recommendations to root out racial discrimination. On the left, there 
were some Demo
crats who hoped for cooperation with the Soviet 
Union to ensure global peace. They condemned Truman’s Cold War 

policies as likely to lead to a third world war. These Democrats espe
-cially resented his dismissal of Secretary of Commerce Henry A. Wal
-lace in 
1946, who w
as a leader of the Demo
cratic left. 
There  
were a gr
eat number of Demo
cratic leaders who hoped that 
Truman would withdraw from the presidential race in 
1948
, but he 
stubbornly determined to seek election as President in his own right. 

When the party convened in Philadelphia on July 
12, it nominated 
him, along with Alben Barkley, the Senate majority leader, as Vice 

President, despite the fact that many members believed Truman would 

be defeated in the general election. Late in the eve 
ning Truman ﬁ
 nally 
spoke to the delegates and gave a rousing speech in which he promised 

to summon Congress into special session to address some of the na-

tion’s most pressing problems, especially civil rights. 
A bitter ﬂ
 oor ﬁ ght broke out over the civil rights plank of the party 
platform. This plank called for a permanent civil rights commission 

and federal legislation outlawing lynching and poll taxes. Despite a 

prolonged battle that turned ugly toward the end, the plank passed, 

whereupon  
thirty-
ﬁve members of the Alabama and Mississippi dele
-gations walked out of the convention, waving the Confederate battle 

ﬂag as
 they departed. Several days later, on July 
17, so-called Dixiecrats 
from thirteen southern states organized the States’ Rights Democratic 
Party and held a convention in Birmingham, where they nominated 

Governor J. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina for President and 

Governor Fielding Wright of Mississippi for Vice President. Although 

they did not expect to win the presidency, they did hope to split the 

electoral vote so that no candidate would win and the election would 

go to the  
House of Representatives, where they could negotiate for 
their votes and in that way achieve their objectives. 
As right-
wingers of the Democratic Party had deserted to form a 
third party, the leftists of the party soon followed their example. On 

July 
22 they held a convention in Philadelphia and formed the Progres
-sive Party with Henry A. Wallace as their presidential candidate, along 

wi
th Senator Glenn Taylor of Idaho for Vice President. Their platform 
252 
a short history of the united states 
called for the nationalization of certain basic industries and a commit
-ment of friendship toward the Soviet  
Un
ion. 
With the Demo
cr
atic Party now split into three segments, it was 
widely believed that Truman would be defeated by any candidate the 
Republicans put forward. Meeting in Philadelphia, the GOP hoped to 

convince General Eisenhower to accept a nomination; others wanted 

the conservative Senator Robert Taft of Ohio; but on the third ballot 

the delegates again chose Thomas Dewey, the glamorous former dis
-trict attorney of New York who had won a conviction against one of the 

most se 
nior Maﬁ
a chieftains. The ticket included Governor Earl War
-ren of California for Vice President. 
Truman was so disliked by the electorate, and his party was so frag
-mented, that Dewey did not feel compelled to mount an aggressive 

ca
mpaign. In fact his approach was so leisurely that he gave the ap
-pearance of someone who felt the presidency was his without having to 

li
ft a ﬁ
nger to reach for it. A bad mistake. Truman, on the other hand, 
knew he was ﬁ
ghting for his po
liti
cal life and went on a  
whistle- 
stop 
rail tour in which he gave 
351 
hard-
hitting speeches to an estimated 
12 million people. “Give ’em hell, Harry,” some crowds called to him. 

“Pour it on.” And Truman did exactly that. He lambasted the “do-

nothing Congress,” as he termed the Eightieth Congress, a Republican-

dominated legislature. He listed its failings, including its rejection of 

his program for aid to farmers, and its passage of the  
Taft-
Hartley 
Act over his veto. Furthermore, Truman called Congress back into a 

special session on July 
26 and demanded that both 
houses at least 
fulﬁll the civil rights promises that the two major parties had adopted 

at their respective conventions. But Congress failed to do anything 

noteworthy. Its members convinced the public that they were indeed 

a “do-
nothing Congress.” 
To the astonishment of the entire nation, Harry S. Truman tri
-umphed over his opposition, winning 
303 electoral votes to 
189 for Dewey and 
39 for Thurmond. In the pop 
ular vote the President re
-ceived 
24,105,812
 to Dewey’s 
21,970,065
; Thurmond’s 
1,169
,063
; and 
Wallace’s 
1,157
,172. In addition, Truman’s Demo
cratic Party won back 
both 
houses of Congress, taking a majority of 
93 seats in the  
House 
and 
12 in the Senate. 
The reasons for this remarkable reversal of conventional opinion 
253 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
became clear as the tabulation of votes continued through election 
night. First, in the big cities, the  
Taft-
Hartley Act convinced labor that 
the Republicans had rejected its support. Next, Truman attracted the 

farm vote of the Midwest by advocating the retention of price supports 

at ninety percent of parity, whereas the Republicans mentioned only 

“ﬂexible” price support. Moreover, the rebellion by leftists against the 
President convinced Americans that the Truman administration was 

not soft on communism, as the Republicans tried to insinuate. In addi
-tion, the revolt by southerners provided proof to 
African-
Americans 
that the Demo
cratic Party was not dominated by racist bigots and was 
their best hope for obtaining  
much-
needed and  
long-
delayed civil 
rights legislation. More than anything 
else, the fact that the nation 
enjoyed peace and prosperity helped the Democratic Party immeasur
-ably. And, ﬁ
na
lly, the Republicans, starting with Dewey, took the 
people for granted and acted as though their election 
were a foregone 
conclusion, something that is always a mistake in politics. 
Truman interpreted his victory as a clear message from the elector
-ate that they wanted a continuation of the domestic reform ﬁ
 rst 
initi
-ated by the New Deal. In his inaugural address of January 
20, 1949
, he described his program as a “Fair Deal,” which would raise the mini
-mum wage from to forty to seventy-
ﬁve cents a
n hour; expand Social 
Security beneﬁ
 ciaries to 
10 million with big increases in beneﬁ
 ts for 
retirees; extend rent control over 
800
,000 new housing units for 
low-
income families; enlarge the TVA, irrigation, and other  
water-
control and hydroelectric projects; and enact price supports for farmers. 

But attempts to repeal the  
Taft-
Hartley Act and obtain legislation for 
civil rights, national health insurance, and federal aid to education 

failed. However, by executive decree, Truman did advance civil rights 

within the armed forces and abolished segregation in the federal civil 

ser
vice. 
Unfortunately, another “Red Scare” developed that ended the bipar
-tisan support that Truman had enjoyed in winning passage for many 

parts of his Fair Deal program. Any number of leading Republicans in 
Congress, especially Senator Robert Taft, attempted to reap politi
cal 
gain by attacking the patriotism and impugning the loyalty of the 

Demo
cratic Party generally and the Truman administration speciﬁ
 -cally. The immediate cause was the Communists’ seizure of China in 
254 
a short history of the united states 
October 
1949
. Taking advantage of the widespread corruption in the 
Nationalist Party of General Chiang  
Kai-
shek, Communist rebels led 
by Mao  
Tse-
tung drove Chiang and his Nationalist army from the 
mainland to the island of Taiwan off the coast of China. Truman did 
not intervene to assist Chiang in the struggle, and he was accused of 

providing indirect aid to the Communists. In Congress, two 

Republicans—Walter H. Judd of Minnesota in the 
House and Wil
-liam Knowland of California in the 
Se
nate—accused the Truman ad
-ministration of virtually handing China over to the Communists. The 

reaso
n, they claimed, was the fact that the U.S. State Department and 
Foreign Ser
vice 
were riddled with active members of the Communist 
Party. 
The disaster in China occurred just as new revelations  were reported 
about a w
idespread Soviet spy network in the United States through 
which atomic and other scientiﬁ
c secrets  
were transmitted to the com
-munists. On March 
22, 1947
, Truman directed the FBI to investigate 
the loyalty of federal employees, and over the next four years about 
200 
individuals 
were dismissed as security risks and another 
2,000 re-signed. Not only did Alger Hiss, who had held an important position 

in
 the State Department, stand trial for allegedly turning over secret 
government documents to a former Soviet courier and found guilty of 

perjury, but Julius and Ethel Rosenberg  were tried, convicted, and ex
-ecuted for helping the Soviets obtain information about building an 

atomic
 bomb. 
The panic over the inﬁ
ltr
ation of communists into the government 
worsened when Republican Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin 

gave a speech on February 
9, 1950
, at a Republican Women’s Club in 
the McClure Hotel in Wheeling, West Virginia, and said that he held 

in his hand a list of 
205
 names of 
card-carry
ing communists in the 
State Department. Newspapers around the country picked up the ac
-cusation and brought the senator the national attention he craved. 

Wh
en it was subsequently shown that the statement was false, McCarthy 
increased the virulence of his attacks by accusing a number of po
liti
cal 
leaders, including General George Marshall, of treason. As chairman 

of a Senate investigating committee, he falsely and recklessly turned 

his outrageous attacks against members of his own party as well as 

Demo
crats. His investigation of the army ﬁ
nally led the Senate, by a 
255 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
vote of 
67 to 22, to condemn him on December 
2, 1954
, for “conduct 
that tends to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute.” Before his 
death in 
1957
, he had succeeded in making the term “McCarthyism” 
synonymous with demagoguery and false accusation. 
The Red Scare also inspired Congress to pass the McCarran Inter
-nal Security Act of 
1950
 and the  
McCarran-
Walter Immigration and 
Nationality Act of 
1950
, which sought to address the problem of com
-munist inﬁ
ltration into the United States, both of which  were passed 
over Truman’s veto. The security mea
sure required communist organi
-zations to register with the attorney general and provide membership 

li
sts and ﬁ
nancial statements; the immigration act continued the na
-tional origin quota systems and provided for the exclusion and depor
-tation of aliens with unacceptable po
liti
cal opinions, especially those 
from eastern and southern Eu
rope. However, it did rectify an old in
-justice by allowing the annual admission of 
2,000 As
ians on a quota 
basis. 
The Cold War got worse during the latter part of Truman’s admin
-istration when, on June 
25, 1950
, communist North Korea attacked the 
Republic of South Korea. The Japanese had annexed Korea in 
1910 but 
surrendered it to the Allies in 
1945
, at the conclusion of World War II. 
Rus sian troops had penetrated Korea down to the 
38th parallel and 
established a communist government. The Republic of South Korea 

was created in 
1948
 and recognized by the UN General Assembly and 
thirty other member states, including the United States. American 

troops in the country 
were then withdrawn. 
When North Korea launched its attack against its southern neigh
-bor it had the approval of the Soviet  Union, which assumed, wrongly, 

that the United States would make no effort to protect the South Ko
-rean Republic. The UN condemned the  
in
vasion—an action the Soviet 
Union might have vetoed, except that it had walked out of the Security 

Council six months earlier over the refusal to grant Communist China 

a seat on that body—and by a vote of nine to zero summoned its mem
-bers to go to South Korea’s rescue. Without asking Congress for a 

de
claration of war, an action that would be repeated by future Presi
-dents during other military crises, Truman authorized the deployment 

of
 American troops in Korea and dispatched the Seventh Fleet to pro
-tect Taiwan. At the same time the UN placed the troops of ﬁ
 fte
en 
256 
a short history of the united states 
other member nations under U.S. command, headed by General Doug
-las MacArthur, who was still in Japan as Supreme Allied Commander. 
Th
ese troops repelled the communist invasion and by October 
1, 1950
, won back the territory up to the 
38th parallel. 
At this point the Communist People’s Republic of China warned that 
if
 the UN forces crossed the 
38th parallel it would send troops to defend 
North Korea. Foolishly, no one in the West believed the warning. The 

UN General Assembly counseled MacArthur to secure all of Korea, and 

he launched a massive invasion of the north, declaring that he expected 

to end the war by Christmas. But, as promised, the Chinese sent about 
1 million soldiers into the disputed territory and drove the UN troops 

back to the 38th parallel. MacArthur urged Truman to blockade Chi-

na’s coastline, assist Chiang 
Kai-
shek in an invasion of the Chinese 
mainland, and drop atom bombs on the country if necessary. 
The Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington counseled an altogether 
different course of action. An 
all-
out war with China was unthinkable. 
It might bring the Soviet  
Union into the war to aid its Communist ally 
inasmuch as the two nations had reached a mutual defense agreement 

in 1950
. As General Omar N. Bradley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, stated, a war with China “would be the wrong war, at the wrong 

place, at the wrong time, and with the wrong enemy.” 
So MacArthur was ordered to limit his activity to the defense of the 
Korea
n Republic. But the general disagreed with the order and, in an 
action that directly contradicted the administration’s foreign policy, he 

sent a letter to the Republican minority leader in the 
House of Repre
-sentatives, Joseph W. Martin of Massachusetts, that said: “We must 

wi
n. There is no substitute for victory.” Martin read the letter in the 
House, to the delight of most Republicans. Truman responded by re
-lieving MacArthur of his command. “I could do nothing  
else a
nd still 
be the President of the United States,” wrote Truman. “Even the Chiefs 

of Staff came to the conclusion that civilian control of the military was 

at stake, and I didn’t let it stay at stake very long.” 
The President acted properly, but it triggered wild demands for his 
im
peachment. MacArthur returned home to be greeted with jubilant 
parades and a triumphant appearance before a joint session of Con
-gress. “Old soldiers never die,” he told the assembled members, “they 

me
rely fade away.” And so he did. He faded away. 
257 The Cold War and Civil Rights 
With the Korean War continuing, despite the beginning of peace 
talks in 
1951
, which wearied and frustrated many Americans, the esca
-lation of 
wholesale prices, which hurt those living on a ﬁ
xed income or 
on Social Security, the repeated assaults by Senator McCarthy on the 
administration’s inability to prevent internal subversion, and the evi
-dence of corruption by some members of the administration, caused 

Tr
uman’s rating in pop
ular opinion polls to plummet to unpre
cedented 
lows and gave Republicans renewed hope that they could win the 
1952 

presidential election. 
In an effort to block the nomination of the conservative and anti– 
Ne
w Dealer Senator Robert Taft, who swept the South and Midwest 
in the early primaries, moderate Republicans such as Senator Henry 

Cabot Lodge, the grandson of Woodrow Wilson’s nemesis of the same 

name, Thomas Dewey, and Governor Earl Warren of California per
-suaded General Dwight Eisenhower to run for the presidency. He re
-ceived the nomination on the ﬁ
rs
t ballot at the Republican National 
Convention in Chicago on July 
7. Senator Richard Nixon of California 
was chosen for Vice President, having won national attention for his 

exposure of Alger Hiss and for his attacks on the loyalty of Demo
crats, 
attacks that won him the nickname “Tricky Dick.” 
Truman chose not to run for reelection, knowing that his unpopu
-larity was so widespread it would defeat the ticket. Actually, he had 

be
en an outstanding chief executive, and later historians generally rated 
him a  
near- 
great president. The Demo
cratic convention, also meeting 
in Chicago, passed up Vice President Barkley and Senator Estes Ke
-fauver of Tennessee, and on July 
27 dr
afted Governor Adlai E. Steven
-son of Illinois to run for President, along with Senator John Sparkman 

of A
labama for Vice President. 
Stevenson was probably the most gifted public speaker since FDR, 
an
d in a series of addresses he promised to advance the programs of the 
New Deal and Fair Deal and win civil rights for  
African-
Americans. 
But Eisenhower was a pop 
ular and genuine war hero who exuded per
-sonal magnetism that captivated his audiences. He promised to clean 

up t
he mess in Washington, and he won over both senators Taft and 
McCarthy, along with their supporters. But Eisenhower remained quiet 

while McCarthy called General George Marshall a traitor, despite the 

fact that Marshall was chieﬂ
y responsible for raising Eisenhower to 
258 
a short history of the united states 
high command during World War II. Perhaps Eisenhower’s most bril
-liant stroke was in making a promise in Detroit on October 
24 tha
t if 
elected he would go to Korea and attempt “an early and honorable end” 
to the Korean War. As a result, he won an overwhelming victory, 

carry
ing 39 states for 
442
 electoral and 
33,824
,000 pop
ular votes, to 
89 electoral votes and 
26,584
,000 pop
ular votes for Stevenson. He even 
carried four southern states: Tennessee, Virginia, Florida, and Texas. 

And the Republicans captured both 
houses of Congress, though by 
very narrow margins. The  
twenty-
year control of at least one or more 
of the executive and legislative branches of the government by the 

Demo
crats had come to an end. 
There was hope that with such a pop 
ular and commanding general 
in the White  
House and with Congress in Republican control an ener
-getic, effective, dynamic leadership in national and international affairs 

woul
d result. No such luck. Eisenhower believed that his pre 
deces sors 
had exercised too much control and therefore he did not attempt to 

direct Congress in enacting a program that reﬂ
ected his vision of where 
the country needed to go. He believed that true leadership consisted of 

reconciling different opinions on important issues, not constructing 

programs and guiding the legislature toward their enactment. He much 

preferred to play golf with successful businessmen. Not surprisingly, 

therefore, between 
1953
, when the Republicans gained control of the 
government, and 
1955
, when they lost it, the party never established 
true direction or achieved important accomplishments. And after 
1955 
the Demo
crats regained control of both houses of Congress and main
-tained it for the next forty years, winning increasing majorities with 

each election. 
If the President did little to provide exciting ideas for new programs 
of ref
orm or improvement, he did exactly what the electorate wanted 
and needed. They preferred rest and quietude after the long, turbulent 

years of depression and war. Enough, they seemed to say. Let us rest. 

And this is precisely what the Eisenhower administration gave them. 

He steered the government through a series of crises without resorting 

to war. And he committed himself and his party to many of the social 

and economic reforms already established during the years of the New 

Deal and Fair Deal, such as the extension of Social Security, public 

housing, and aid to education. He followed a policy of economic 
259 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
conservatism and social liberalism. He characterized himself as “liberal 
on human issues, and conservative on economic ones.” He especially 

opposed governmental intrusion into areas that private utilities could 

handle, not excluding atomic and power facilities. 
As a po
liti
cal realist, Eisenhower understood the importance and 
value of compromise, and so he cooperated with the Democratic lead
-ership to win passage of more moderate proposals. For example, the 

So
cial Security Act of January 
14, 1954
, added 10.5 million workers to 
the rolls and increased monthly beneﬁ
ts to all the participants in the 
program. The  
Wiley-
Dondero bill of May 
3, 1954
, authorized the con
-struction with Canada of a channel  twenty- 
seve
n feet deep between 
Montreal and Lake Erie and established the St. Lawrence Seaway De
-velopment Corporation to ﬁ
nan
ce the operation. The seaway was com
-pleted in June 
1959
 and made possible the navigation of ships from 
Montreal to Lake Superior, except during the winter. 
Of par
tic 
ular importance was passage of the Highway Act of 
1956
, which authorized construction of a 
42,000-mile interstate highway 
system in which the federal government would contribute 
90 percent of 
construction costs. After all, it was an interstate program. New taxes 

were levied on gasoline to help ﬁ
nance the operation. This elaborate 
highway system took nearly twenty-
ﬁve years to complete, and the cost 
rose to over $
75 billion. It was the largest public works project ever at
-tempted, and it effectively changed the way Americans lived and trav
-eled. Congress also passed water conservation mea
sures, school and 
hospital construction projects, and a health bill that supported medical 

research. 
In achieving his goals, Eisenhower proved to be a very skilled politi
-cal backroom trader. He realized he had to work with the Demo
cra
tic 
majorities in Congress, in particular Sam Rayburn of Texas, Speaker 

of the  
House of Representatives, and Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, 
majority leader in the Senate, who also recognized that it was in their 

interest and the interest of the Demo
cratic Party to adopt a policy of 
accommodation with the administration. The resulting, if limited, suc
-cess of the Eisenhower administration was attributed to this under
-standing by both sides. 
In keeping with the promise he made during the campaign, Eisen
-hower went to Korea six months after taking ofﬁ
ce to lend his authority 
260 a short history of the united states 
to assist the working out of a truce. On July 
27, 195
3, the United States, 
North and South Korea, and the People’s Republic of China signed an 
armistice agreement that drew a line at the 
38th parallel, which would 
thereafter separate North and South Korea. 
Still, the communist threat remained. The Soviet  Union continued 
it
s ruthless suppression of freedom in eastern Eu
rope, crushing rebel
-lions in East Berlin and Hungary. Acting on Eisenhower’s recommen
-dation, Congress raised the defense bud
get to
 unpre 
cedented heights, 
from nearly $
13 billion in 
1950
 to nearly $
40 billion in 
1960
. The rise of 
what Eisenhower called the  
military-
industrial complex was expected 
to prepare the nation for any possible threat to its safety. In what was 

termed the Eisenhower Doctrine, Congress authorized the President 

to extend military and economic aid to guard the Middle East from 

communist expansion. Then, when Fidel Castro led an invasion that 

turned out to be communist in its intent and purposes and captured 

Cuba, the threat of possible invasion from this island that was only 

ninety miles from the United States became a frightening possibility. 

In addition, the development of the hydrogen bomb by both the United 

States and the Soviet  
Union worsened fears that the entire planet could 
be destroyed at any time by an escalation of the Cold War. 
Communists in Indochina had been waging a struggle for inde 
pen-dence from French rule since 
1946. No
w, with the conclusion of the 
Korean War, the People’s Republic of China increased its assistance to 

the Indochinese nationals. An agreement was reached at a foreign 

ministers conference in Geneva in May 
1954
 to divide Indochina into 
two parts, like Korea. Then, on October 
11, 1954
, the  
communist-
backed 
Viet Minh captured control of the northern half of what would now be 

called Vietnam, and a noncommunist government was established in 

the southern half. In one of his ﬁ
nal actions as President, Eisenhower 
sent 
3,500
 troops to bolster the noncommunist southern portion of 
Vietnam. 
One of the 
most extraordinary developments that appeared in the 
1950s was the emergence of a youth culture that found its best expres
-sion in music. The expanded number of teenagers in this period dis
-missed the “swing bands” and melodic music of their parents as 
261 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
old-
fashioned and rather tame for their tastes and turned to what was 
called “rock and roll,” a blend of rhythm and blues and southern coun
-try music. One of the best and most successful exponents of rock and 
ro
ll was Elvis Presley, whose  
hip-
swinging style of performing alarmed 
parents, who feared for their children’s moral safety. With the arrival 

of the British rock group the Beatles, the popularity of rock and roll 

dominated all other forms of music. What soon evolved was an anti- 

establishment counterculture in which “hippies,” as they 
were known, 
wore long hair, engaged in communal living, became sexually promis
-cuous, experimented with marijuana and other drugs, and foreswore 

politi
cal involvement. This hippie phase of the youth movement faded 
by the early 
1970
s. But rock and roll remained a symbol of youthful 
rebellion. 
A mong the mo st 
im
portant domestic issues that arose during the 
1950
s was civil rights, which Truman had tried to win but failed. As a 
consequence, he was forced to use executive powers to ﬁ
ght Jim Crow 
laws. Eisenhower continued this policy, if half heartedly, but it was up 
to Congress to initiate legislation that would strengthen existing civil 

rights laws. Then, on May 
17, 1954
, in the landmark decision 
Brown v. 
Board of Education of Topeka
, the Supreme Court, under Chief Justice 
Earl Warren, reversed 
Plessy v. Ferguson
 (1896
), which had allowed 
segregation in schools provided they were “separate but equal.” Now 

the Court ruled that compulsory racial segregation in public schools 

was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal 

rights to all citizens. The following year the Court went farther and 

instructed all federal district courts to require local authorities to move 

with “all deliberative speed” toward the desegregation of all public 

schools. Also in 
1955
, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move 
to the back of a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and her action 

touched off a yearlong bus boycott in that city led by the Reverend Dr. 

Martin Luther King Jr. 
Although President Eisenhower suffered a serious heart attack on 
September 
24, 1955
, he decided to run for a second term. The Demo
-crats again put forward Adlai Stevenson, who was badly beaten. Eisen
-hower won all but seven southern states, even though the Demo
cra
ts 
262 
a short history of the united states 
retained control of both 
ho
uses of Congress. He scored 
457
 electoral 
and 
35,590
,472
 pop
ular votes to Stevenson’s 
73 electoral and 
26,029,752 pop
ular votes. Eisenhower became the ﬁ
rst candidate to win the presi
-dency since the election of 
1848
 whose po
liti
cal party failed to carry ei
-ther 
house of Congress. 
Following his election, Eisenhower asked Congress to enact legisla
-tion to protect the civil rights of American citizens. But this proved to 
be ex
ceedingly difﬁ
cult because of the stiff opposition of southerners in 
both the 
House and Senate. The civil rights movement of the 
1950
s and 
1960
s, following the lead of Dr. King, was basically nonviolent. Civil 
disobedience became a very effective strategy for showing the Ameri
-can people, via tele
visio
n, how  
African-
Americans  
were denied their 
basic rights as citizens, especially in the South. Passive demonstrators 

were often assaulted by  
baton-
 wielding police and attack dogs as the 
nation watched these appalling confrontations on televi
sion at night. 
Congress could no longer disregard the rising indignation of the 
elect
orate over its failure to pass civil rights legislation. Finally an ef
-fective bill was introduced in the  House that was later watered down in 

th
e Senate to provide the Civil Rights Act of 
1957
. This legislation cre
-ated the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice and set up 

a Co
mmission on Civil Rights. It empowered the attorney general to 
seek court injunctions against those accused of preventing citizens 

from exercising their voting rights. Those accused would be tried in 

federal court by a jury of their peers. Unfortunately, it was a very weak 

bill and proved to be all but useless. Discriminatory practices contin
-ued in the South without letup. Those registrars accused of violating 

th
e law  
were tried by  
all-
white juries and acquitted. And the Civil 
Rights Act of 
1957
 did not appreciably increase the number of regis
-tered  
African-
American voters over the next several years. Still, Con
-gress had passed the ﬁ
rs
t civil rights bill since Reconstruction. And as 
Lyndon Johnson said so graphically, “Once you break the virginity, it’ll 

be easier next time.” 
Five days prior to the President’s signing this legislation, the ﬁ
 rst 
outright deﬁ
 ance of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the 
Brown
 case oc
-curred on September 
3, 1957
, when the governor of Arkansas, Orval E. 
Faubus, called out the National Guard in an attempt to prevent the 

integration of a high school in Little Rock. Much as Eisenhower 
263 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
personally deplored the 
Brown
 decision, he could not allow deﬁ
 ance of 
national authority to go unchecked, so he federalized the National 
Guard and dispatched regular army troops to reopen the school and 

keep order. What many southerners had feared had now taken place, 

namely the executive using his authority as commander in chief to 

compel obedience to a court order. Now it was obvious to all that the 

federal government, when necessary, could and would apply military 

force to protect the rights of 
African-
Americans. Discrimination based 
on race in whatever guise was now legally over. 
In the 
1960
s the civil rights movement picked up speed when four 
black college students in Greensboro, North Carolina, entered a 

whites- 
only lunch counter, sat down, and refused an order to leave. 
Many other “sit-
ins” followed, especially among young white and black 
students who protested segregation or took “freedom rides” on inter
-state buses to force the attention of the public to the discrimination 

th
at was still practiced in the South. Violence broke out in Mississippi 
and Alabama, in which ﬁ
re hoses and dogs  
were used, and resulted 
in the arrests of thousands of black protesters. These atrocities against 

unarmed citizens helped win passage of a new Civil Rights Act in 

1960
; it provided criminal penalties for bombings and other actions 
that attempted to obstruct court orders. It also authorized judges to ap
-point referees to assist  
Afr
ican-
Americans to register and vote. Al
-though it was not a major advance against racial discrimination, Lyndon 

Jo
hnson hoped it would be an expression of “responsible moderation” 
and “common sense.” 
At the Demo
cr
atic nominating convention in Los Angeles in 
mid-
July, a strong civil rights plank was adopted, but southerners did 
not walk out in protest. On the ﬁ
rst ballot the convention chose Sena
-tor John Kennedy of Massachusetts along with Lyndon Johnson as his 

ru
nning mate. At the Republican convention Richard M. Nixon was 
put forward, as well as Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. The 

parties also endorsed a strong civil rights bill and the desegregation of 

public schools. 
It was a close race, the closest since 
188
4, when Grover Cleveland 
eked out a victory over James G. Blaine. In the 
1960
 contest, John Ken
-nedy gathered 
100
,000 more votes than Nixon, out of a record 
68.8 million votes cast. Kennedy’s total was 
34,226
,731
 pop
ular and 
303 
The United States
265 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
electoral votes representing twenty-two states to Nixon’s 
34,108
,157 
pop
ular and 
219
 electoral votes from twenty-six states. This was the 
ﬁrst election in which ﬁ
fty states participated. On January 
3, 1959
, Alaska was admitted as the  
forty-
ninth state, and on August 
21, 1959
, Hawaii became the ﬁ
ftieth state in the  
Union. 
The Cold War again troubled the nation’s security when the Soviet 
Un
ion launched its ﬁrst satellite, Sputnik, into orbit on October 
4, 1957
. In response, Congress enacted the National Aeronautic and Space Act 
(NASA) of 
1958
, which set up a civilian authority to direct the nation’s 
exploration of space. After assuming ofﬁ
ce, Kennedy asked Congress 
for an increase of $
126 million over the $
111 million Eisenhower had 
requested for NASA. Congress bettered it by adding another $
127
 mil
-lion to the President’s request. 
And not a moment too soon. The Rus
sians wo
n the contest for put
-ting the ﬁ
rst man in space when, on April 
12, 1961, Yury Gagarin com
-pleted a journey into space aboard a  rocket-propelled vehicle. Not until 

May 
5, 1961, did Alan Shepard Jr. complete a suborbital 
300
-mile ﬂ
 ight 
aboard a Redstone rocket. Twenty days later, on May 
25, President 
Kennedy addressed a special joint session of Congress and declared 

that “this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this 

decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely 
to earth.” Then, on February 
2, 1962
, John Glenn orbited the earth 
three times in four hours. But not until July 
16, 1969
, did  
astronauts 
Neil A. Armstrong and Col
onel Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. succeed in reach
-ing the moon aboard a gigantic Saturn rocket. Armstrong took his ﬁ
 rst step on the surface of the moon at 
10:56
 AM Eastern Standard Time 
on July 
20 as tele
vision viewers around the world watched. He and 
Aldrin planted an American ﬂ
ag on the site and left a plaque that read, 
“We came in peace for all mankind.” After taking rock and soil sam
-ples, the two men conducted a number of experiments on the moon. 

They then successfully rendezvoused with the mother ship, pi
loted by 
Lieutenant Col
onel Michael Collins, and returned to earth, splashing 
down about 
950 miles from Hawaii on July 
24. It was quite a feat in the space race with the Soviet  
Union. But this 
rivalry constituted only one aspect of the Cold War between Rus
sia and the United States. Once Fidel Castro admitted that he was a com
-munist and that Cuba would adopt a communist system of government 
266 a short history of the united states 
there was a sense of urgency among Americans to seize the island and 
rest
ore a liberated administration, especially after American property 
on the island was seized and Castro became an ally of the Soviet 

Union. Prior to leaving ofﬁ
ce, Eisenhower had approved a plan for the 
invasion of Cuba by 
anti-
Castro Cubans trained and  
supplied with 
American arms and money and protected by U.S. aircraft. But it was 

President Kennedy who gave the executive order to begin the invasion 

after his military and intelligence ofﬁcials assured him that Castro did 

not have sufﬁ
cient forces to repulse an invasion and that the Cuban 
people would rise up and join the rebellion. So the invasion began on 

April 
17, 1961,
 and ended disastrously when the invaders became bogged 
down in the marshes of the Bay of Pigs. Kennedy refused to allow air 

support and, as a result, over a thousand 
anti-
Castro Cubans  were cap
-tured, tried, and sentenced to thirty years in prison. Furthermore, 

Premier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet  Union threatened to come to 
Cuba’s aid if the United States did not “call a halt to the aggression 

against the Republic of Cuba.” 
Worse, during the summer and autumn of 
1962
 the Soviets began 
building missile sites in Cuba capable of launching nuclear bombs 

against the United States. In a televised speech to the nation on Octo
-
ber 22, 1962
, President Kennedy, risking a possible war with the Soviet 
Union, demanded that the bases be dismantled and the missiles re
-moved. Pending compliance, he ordered the U.S. Navy to commence 

“a
 strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment 
to Cuba.” In other words, the United States would stop and search all 

ships bound for the island, regardless of nationality, and turn back any 

carry
ing military weapons. Kennedy said he was requesting an emer
-gency meeting of the UN Security Council to consider a resolution to 

deman
d immediate removal of the missiles. “It shall be the policy of 
this nation,” he continued, “to regard any nuclear missile launched 

from Cuba against any nation in the western hemi
sphere as an attack 
by the Soviet  
Union on the United States requiring a full retaliatory 
response upon the Soviet  
Union.” 
Fortunately, Khrushchev realized he had overplayed his hand, and 
in a
n exchange between the two leaders of the communist and free 
worlds it was agreed that the Soviet 
Union would remove the missiles 
and the United States would promise not to invade Cuba. Both sides 
267 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
complied with the agreement, and the likelihood of a nuclear war be
-tween the two countries was averted. 
Another incident of the Cold War involved the action by the Soviets 
to
 seal off East Germany. A year earlier, in August 
1961
, the commu
-nists closed the border crossings in Berlin and built the Berlin Wall, 
ostensi
bly to prevent East Germans from escaping into the West. It 
was an action that would separate East and West Berlin for the next 

twenty-
eight years. 
One of the ways that Kennedy hoped to bring about a greater  union 
am
ong free peoples around the world was passage of the Peace Corps 
Act, on September 
22, 1961
, in which $
40 million for ﬁ
 scal 
1962 
was appropriated to prepare thousands of young American men and women 

for volunteer work providing educational, medical, and other technical 

ser
vices in underdeveloped countries. The overwhelming response by 
young people in colleges and universities indicated how strongly they 

believed they could make a difference in helping to improve living 

conditions throughout the world. The Peace Corps enjoyed great suc
-cess from the very beginning. 
But the need at home in several areas was also great, especially 
among  
African-
Americans. Still, Kennedy indicated that civil rights 
were not a top priority for his administration, probably because he 

needed southern support for other mea
sures he deemed more urgent, 
such as education and housing. A seemingly vigorous man in his early 

forties, who successfully concealed his many medical problems from 

public scrutiny, Kennedy spoke boldly and called for mea
sures in a pro
-gram labeled the “New Frontier” that would combat tyranny, poverty, 

dis
ease, and war. But events would occur that would force the young 
President to change his mind. 
Freedom riders who hoped to desegregate the South  
were at
tacked 
in Alabama, and their bus burned by an angry mob. Race riots oc
-curred, forcing the governor to declare martial law to restore order. 

Th
e violence escalated, and once more the nation witnessed the conse
-quences of racial bigotry. But it had one salutary effect in bringing 

about pa
ssage of the  
Twenty-
fourth Amendment to the Constitution, 
which outlawed poll taxes as a requirement for voting. At the time 

when the amendment was  
ratiﬁ
 ed—January 
23, 1964
—Virginia, Texas, 
Alabama, arkansas, and Mississippi charged a poll tax. 
268 
a short history of the united states 
Another clash between state and federal authorities occurred on 
Oct
ober 
1, 1962
, when James Meredith, a  
twenty-
nine-year-old 
African-
American, sought admission to the University of Mississippi. Governor 
Ross Barnett tried to prevent the enrollment and when rioting resulted 

President Kennedy dispatched federal troops to restore order and block 

any effort to prevent Meredith from enrolling. 
The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his Southern Chris
-tian Leadership Conference initiated nonviolent demonstrations on 

Apr
il 
3, 1963
, in Birmingham, Alabama, a city that was determined to 
maintain its long tradition of segregation. “If we can crack Birming
-ham,” declared King, “I am convinced we can crack the South. Bir
-mingham is a symbol of segregation for the entire South.” The police 

com
missioner, T. Eugene “Bull” Connor, was prepared to meet these 
nonviolent demonstrations with force, using clubs and attack dogs. Ap
-proximately 
2,000 Afr
ican-
Americans  
were arrested and jailed. 
These continuing disorders in Birmingham prompted Kennedy to 
deman
d a strong civil rights bill from Congress. Otherwise, he said, 
leadership on both sides would pass “to the purveyors of hate and vio
-lence.” Emanuel Celler, chairman of the  
Ho
use Judiciary Committee, 
exploded over what was happening in the South. “Police clubs and 

bludgeons, ﬁ
re hoses and dogs have been used on defenseless school 
children who  
were marching and singing hymns,” he raged. The motel 
where Dr. King was staying and the home of King’s brother  were 

bombed, causing the black population of the city to rise up in fury. 

Rocks 
were thrown and ﬁ
re hoses  
were turned on the rioters. Disorder 
reigned. But Congress ﬁ
nally responded, and 
127
 civil rights bills  
were introduced in the 
House of Representatives. “The cause of desegrega
-tion,” wrote Walter Lippmann in the 
Washington Post
 on May 
28, “must 
cease to be a Negro movement, blessed by white politicians from 

Northern states. It must become a national movement to enforce na
-tional laws, led and directed by the National Government.” 
Rioting in many northern cities turned streets into bloody encoun
-ters between protesters and police. The nation seemed to be descend
-ing into turmoil and lawlessness. When Governor George Wallace of 

Al
abama stood at the door of a building to block black students from 
registering at the University of Alabama on June 
11, 1963,
 Kennedy 
federalized the Alabama National Guard and forced Wallace to step 
269 The Cold War and Civil Rights 
out of the way. The following day, Medgar Evers, a Mississippi civil 
rights activist, was shot as he stood at the door of his home. Pressure 

built quickly to address this troubling issue, and over 
200
,000 black 
and white activists marched for “jobs and freedom” from the Washing
-ton Monument to the Lincoln Memorial on August 
28, 1963
, where they 
heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his famous “I have a dream” speech. 

It was the largest public demonstration ever held in the nation’s capital. 
Then the violence in the country reached a peak with the assassina
-tion of President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on Friday, November 
22, 1963
. It numbed the nation. The temper, mood, and po
liti
cal atmosphere 
in the country underwent a profound change. Few could believe that a 

young, handsome, seemingly energetic,  
well-
loved president could be 
killed in plain sight during a public appearance in the streets of a major 

city. People wept openly. In a single moment the nation seemed to age 

and grow morose. Kennedy’s body was ﬂ
own back to Washington, where 
it lay in state in the White  
House before being removed to the Rotunda 
of the Capitol and placed on the catafalque that had supported the re
-mains of President Lincoln. Throughout the night and the next morn
-ing, thousands of mourners silently ﬁ
led past the cofﬁ
n to pay their 
respects. Heads of state and foreign dignitaries from around the world 

arrived to attend the funeral. A brief ceremony in the Rotunda included 

short eulogies by the Senate majority leader, Mike Mansﬁ
eld, Speaker of 
the 
House John McCormack, and Chief Justice Earl Warren. 
Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson had accompanied Kennedy to 
Te
xas and was sworn in as chief executive aboard the plane that carried 
Kennedy’s remains back to Washington. Appearing before Congress 

on November 
27, he declared that no eulogy “could more eloquently 
honor President Kennedy’s memory than the earliest possible passage 

of a civil rights bill for which he fought so long.” Then, on January 
8, 1964
, in his ﬁrst State of the  
Union address, Johnson announced the 
start of a “War on Poverty” in the United States. 
In what was interpreted as the wish of the members of Congress to 
demo
nstrate forcefully how devastated the entire nation was over Ken-
nedy’s assassination, they enacted in quick succession a number of im
-portant mea 
sure
s. First, the Clean Air Act of 
1963
 was passed on 
December 
17, authorizing $
95 million for matching grants by state and 
local agencies to reduce pollution and develop air control programs. 
270 a short history of the united states 
Then came the Civil Rights Act of 
196
4, which forbade discrimination 
because of race in most places of public accommodation; authorized 
the attorney general to institute suits to desegregate public facilities, 

including schools; banned discrimination on account of race or sex by 

employers, labor  
unions, or employment agencies; created the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission; prohibited discrimination in 

the use of federal funds by states and other local authorities; and cre
-ated a Community Relations Ser
vi
ce to assist individuals and ofﬁ
 cials 
in dealing with racial problems at the local level. Southerners in the 

Senate attempted a ﬁ
 libuster to delay or kill the legislation, which ran 
on for over two and half months but was ﬁ
nally brought to an end with 
a cloture  
vote—a device to shut off debate whereby  two-
thirds of the 
senators (at that time) agree to stop the ﬁ
 libuster. 
In the presence of members of Congress, cabinet members, foreign 
am
bassadors, and leaders of the civil rights movement, Johnson signed the 
legislation at 
6:45
 PM on June 
19, in the East Room of the White  
House, 
only a few hours after it had been passed. Johnson called on all Americans 

“to join in this effort to bring justice and hope to all our people.” 
The Civil Rights Act of 
196
4 was the most  
far-
reaching civil rights 
legislation enacted since Reconstruction. It went beyond what Presi
-dent Kennedy had originally proposed and marked a true beginning of 

th
e lessening of racial and sex discrimination around the country. 
This momentous legislation was achieved because of a mounting 
awa
reness around the country of the denial of basic freedoms for African-
Americans and the hideous suppression of their attempts to achieve 

those freedoms. Americans  
were recognizing, at long last, that condi
-tions for blacks violated everything this country stood for in terms of 

pe
rsonal rights. In addition, the assassination of President Kennedy so 
overwhelmed citizens with grief that they demanded a halt to the civil 

unrest permeating the entire country. In winning passage of this Civil 

Rights Act, President Johnson rightly stated: “This has been a year 

without pre
cedent in the history of relations between the Executive and 
Legislative Branches of our Government.” 
And the American people approved of what was happening in 
Wa
shington. They provided a landslide victory for Johnson and the 
Demo
cratic Party in the election of 
1964
. He captured 
44 states and the 
District of Columbia over the 
6 states his Republican rival, Senator 
271 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
Barry Goldwater of Arizona, had won. Johnson had a total of 
486
 to Goldwater’s 
52 electoral votes. It was well known that Gold
water had 
voted against the Civil Rights Act, and that fact helped win him the 
Deep South: Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, and South 

Carolina. This result marked a turning point in the development of the 

Republican Party in those states. The election also brought ﬁ
 ve new 
Republican representatives to the  House from Alabama, and one each 

from Georgia and Mississippi. They 
were the ﬁ
rst southern Republi
-cans elected to Congress since Reconstruction. And more would follow 

until the South was no longer Democratic but solidly Republican. 
Another signiﬁ
ca
nt event took place when the Democratic caucus in 
Congress censured two southern 
members—John Bell Williams of 

Mississippi and Albert W. Watson of South  Carolina—for publicly 

supporting Goldwater in the election. That had never happened be
-fore. Moreover, they 
were str
ipped of their seniority rights as congress
-men, whereupon Watson switched parties and later won reelection to 

th
e  House as the ﬁ
rst Republican from South Carolina since Recon
-struction. Watson’s action was followed by other southerners, most 

no
tably Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who had thrown 
his support to Goldwater in the election. 
With a greatly 
increased Demo
cr
atic majority in Congress, and 
exercising his extraordinary leadership skills, President Johnson ap
-pealed to the members to join in providing the country with a program 
he
 called the “Great Society.” He wanted to improve the lives of Amer
-icans in every section of the country. He urged passage of Medicare 

legisl
ation for the el
derly, to be ﬁ
nanced out of the Social Security sys
-tem. As part of this health care program he called for Medicaid for the 

ne
edy, both of which  
were enacted on July 
30, 1965
. Other parts of the 
Great Society included an Education Act, passed in April 
1965
, which 
provided $
1.3 billion in direct aid to public schools as well as parochial 
schools for a number of “shared ser
vices.” In addition, the Higher Edu
-cation Act appropriated $
650 million for scholarships for needy stu
-dents attending colleges and universities. These two education acts 

were rega
rded by many as the major successes of Johnson’s ﬁ
rst year as 
President following his election. 
272 
a short history of the united states 
The Housing and Urban Development Act provided federal assis
-tance for the construction of 
low-
rent pub
lic housing and urban 
renewal that aided cities in removing blight and making their com
-munities more attractive. The Department of Housing and Develop
-ment was established to speed this initiative. The Food Stamp Act 
al
lowed the federal government, in cooperation with state govern
-ments, to provide stamps with which the poor could purchase food. 

An
d the Economic Opportunity Act created an ofﬁ
ce to administer 
ten programs to address the many causes of poverty and hunger in 

the country, leaving the states free to veto all community action proj
-ects that it felt inappropriate. Moreover, the Water and Air Quality 

Acts requ
ired all states to establish and enforce water quality stan
-dards for all interstate water routes within their boundaries, and de
-velop air pollution prevention programs, including emission standards 

for automo
biles. 
Of par
tic 
ular importance was the enactment of the Immigration 
Act of 
1965
, which fundamentally changed the immigration policy of 
the country by eliminating quotas, placing all nations on an equal foot
-ing, and limiting admission to 
170,000 an
nually with a maximum of 
20,000 from any one nation. 
Much of the credit for this extraordinary program of reform be
-longed to the President himself. “Lyndon Johnson,” wrote the Speaker 

of t
he 
House, Tip  O’Neill, “worked closely with the Congress and fol
-lowed the details of legislation more carefully than any other president 

I’
ve seen. He left nothing to chance
. . . . 
When it came to politics, that 
man k
new all the tricks
. . . . 
When it came to dealing with Congress, 
he w
as the best I’ve ever seen
. . . . 
And what a talker! That man could 
ta
lk a bone away from a dog.” 
But in the area of civil rights much more needed to be done. Voter 
regist
ration of 
African-
Americans had not improved signiﬁ
 cantly. So 
the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. launched an offensive in 

Selma, Alabama, on January 
18, 1965
. That city claimed a population 
that was 
57.6 percent black, but only 
2.1 percent of that number 
were registered to vote. “We plan to triple the number of registered Negro 

voters in Alabama for the 
1966
 Congressional elections,” declared King; 
“then we plan to purge Alabama of all Congressmen who have stood in 
273 
The Cold War and Civil Rights 
the way of Negroes
. . . . A state that denies people education cannot 
deman
d literacy tests as a qualiﬁ
cation for voting.” 
On “Bloody Sunday,” March 
7, som
e 600 civil rights activists headed 
out of Selma, but they got only as far as the Edmund Pettus Bridge, 
where they 
were attacked by state and local police and driven back to 

Selma. The leaders went to court. They demanded the court’s protec
-tion to hold another march, a 
ﬁ fty
-four-
mile Freedom March from 
Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. The court obliged, and on 

Sunday, March 
21, some 
3,200
 men and women, black and white, set 
out for Montgomery, walking twelve miles a day and sleeping in the 

ﬁelds along the way. On Thursday, March 
25, now numbering ap
-proximately 
25,000, th
ey reached their destination. Again, rioting oc
-curred, with state troopers and mounted policemen brandishing 

nig
htsticks, ﬁ
rearms, and tear gas. A horriﬁ
ed nation watched on 
tele
vision as screaming, bloody marchers ﬂ
ed in panic from their at
-tackers. 
Demonstrations multiplied.  
Sit
-ins became commonplace, and the 
nation was forced once again to confront its history of racial strife and 

violence. A nation that prided itself on being compassionate and gener
-ous toward the less fortunate had to face the fact that bigots and hood
-lums regularly sullied this image in the eyes of the world. 
A week later President Lyndon B. Johnson, in a televised address to 
a ni
ght session of both 
houses of Congress, urged passage of stronger 
voter rights legislation. “It is not just Negroes,” he said, “but it is all of 

us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. 

And we 
shall
 overcome.” Congress followed through by passing the 
Voting Rights Act of 
1965
, which was signed by Johnson on August 
5. It was, he said, “a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that has 

ever been won on the battleﬁ
eld.” By this act, he declared, “we strike 
away the last major shackle of those ﬁ
erce and ancient bonds” that 
have bound  
African-
Americans to slavery since their arrival on this 
continent. 
The Voting Rights Act suspended literacy and other tests for voting 
and authorized federal supervision of registration in districts that had 
used such tests. Registrars 
were assigned to Alabama, Georgia, Louisi
-ana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, and 
274 
a short history of the united states 
within ﬁ
ve mo
nths registration of 
African-
Americans in the South in
-creased forty percent. It was a major triumph for an administration that 
had al
ready achieved many notable successes. 
Despite these many 
succe
sses, the Cold War persisted. And 
now it resurfaced as a paramount issue and ultimately drove Lyndon 

Johnson from ofﬁ
ce. The Vietnam War was another extension of the 
struggle between the free and communist worlds. 
The ﬁ
ghting between the communist North Vietnam
ese and the 
noncommunist South Viet
nam
ese intensiﬁ
ed, and that intensiﬁ
 cation 
made the South Viet
nam
ese more dependent on the United States for 
economic and military assistance. Consumed with the fear that a 

victory for the communists in Vietnam would have a domino effect 

throughout Asia, Johnson committed himself to providing aid at the 

very beginning of his administration. By the summer of 
1964
 approxi
-mately 
21,000 Ame
rican ser
vicemen  
were stationed in Vietnam as ad
-visers. But the need for additional troops  
rose eac
h month 
Then, on August 
4, 196
4, when two U.S. destroyers  
were attacked in 
the Gulf of Tonkin, Johnson ordered retaliatory air strikes and asked 

Congress to approve his action. Three days later Congress passed the 

Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, one of the most fateful and controversial 

resolutions in U.S. history. Johnson signed it on August 
10. This reso
-lution permitted the President as commander in chief to take all neces
-sary steps to repel an armed attack against U.S. forces and prevent 

fu
rther aggression in Vietnam. The attack on the two destroyers had 
actually been overblown by the administration and had been used as a 

pretext for initiating a war with congressional approval. 
Despite the massive number of American troops sent to Vietnam 
an
d a  two-
phase plan to bomb North Vietnam, the situation in South 
Vietnam continued to deteriorate as one civilian government followed 

another in a series of coups that weakened the effort to bring the war to 

an end. Johnson increased the number of troops in South Vietnam on 

July 
28, 1965
, from 
75,000 to 125
,000,
 to serve as ﬁ
ghting personnel, not 
merely as advisers. The ﬁ
rst major ground battle of the war involving 
American soldiers took place on August 
18, 1965
, on the Van Tuong 
Peninsula. Military funds reached almost $
2 billion. 
The Vietnam War
276 
a short history of the united states 
By this time opposition to the war had begun to mount. Students in 
co
lleges and universities, starting with the University of California at 
Berkeley, staged demonstrations and  
sit-
ins protesting the war. They 
burned their draft cards. At the same time the Pentagon informed 
President Johnson that success in Vietnam was possible only if the 

troop level was raised from 
120,000 to a “minimum essential force” of 
500
,000. War spending began to heat up the economy and send inﬂ
 ation 
soaring. Rioting over civil rights continued in Atlanta, Chicago, Cleve
-land, and New York. College campuses produced disruptive demon
-strations. Worst of all  were the increased numbers of Americans killed 

an
d wounded in Vietnam that 
were reported daily. “That broke the 
back of the Great Society right there,” said Speaker Carl Albert. The 

money necessary to implement the Great Society now went for ﬁ
 ghting 
an unpop
ular war. 
And because the ﬁ
 ght
ing intensiﬁ
ed, the cost of the war spiraled 
upward, to $
2 billion a month. Aid was promised to the North Viet
-nam
ese by the People’s Republic of China in August 
1967
, and at the 
same time China shot down American ﬁ
ghter planes that violated its 
airspace. Johnson increased the forces in Vietnam to 
535
,000, and each 
month hundreds of thousands of tons of explosives w
ere dropped on 
North Vietnam. Higher taxes  
were demanded as inﬂ
 ation skyrock
-eted. 
The continuing Cold War and the Vietnam War dramatically al
-tered American life and culture. And they divided the nation regard
-ing its goals and aspirations. 
10Violence, Scandal, and the 
En
d of the Cold War
Violence had become
 a way of life. City streets regularly 
erupted in violence. Televi
sion, which the Radio Corporation of 
America ﬁ
rst tested in 
1933 with a signal from the Empire State Build
-ing in New York City to Camden, New Jersey, found it an excellent 
me
ans of attracting viewers, and so more and more televi
sion programs 
appeared in which violence was the central component. And the killing 

in Vietnam increased. On January 
30, 1968
, the Vietcong launched a 
major  
attack—called the Tet Offensive after the Vietnam
ese holiday 
(the lunar new year) on which it 
occurred—against every important 
South Viet
nam
ese city and town, and also shelled the American em
-bassy in Saigon. In the ﬁ
gh
ting U.S. forces suffered heavy casualties, 
triggering renewed demonstrations and antiwar rallies at home and 

necessitating the increase in troops in Vietnam to well over 
700
,000 in order to achieve victory. 
Politi
cally, the  
stepped-
up offensive had notable consequences. Sen
-ator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota announced his candidacy for the 

Dem
ocratic presidential nomination on a peace platform, and thou
-sands of young Americans streamed to his side. It was another way of 

pr
otesting the war. In the New Hampshire primary McCarthy’s show
-ing was almost even with Johnson’s. The results prompted Robert 

Ke
nnedy, the brother of the late President and now a senator from New 
York, to announce his candidacy. He had always opposed the war, but 
278 
a short history of the united states 
he did it privately. Now he came out publicly and declared that the war 
coul
d not be won and that the United States should withdraw from 
Vietnam. “Our enemy,” he declared, “has ﬁ
nally shattered the mask of 
ofﬁ
cial illusion with which we have concealed our true circumstances, 
even from ourselves.” 
Recognizing that his popularity had shriveled to the point where his 
reelect
ion had become impossible, Johnson announced to a televised 
audience on March 
31 that he was withdrawing his candidacy. He also 
declared that he would end all U.S. air and naval bombardment of 

North Vietnam in the hope that peace talks could begin so as to bring 

about a negotiated settlement. North Vietnam agreed to this condition, 

the bombing halted, and delegates assembled in Paris on May 
10 to ini
-tiate preliminary talks. Formal negotiations began on January 
16, 196
9. Then, a savage act of violence erupted again when, on April 
4, 1968
, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by James 
Earl Ray in Memphis. This killing aroused further violence in more 

than 
100
 cities, including Washington, D.C. The country was faced 
with the fact that its streets at home and the streets in Vietnam  were 

soaked with blood because of Americans intent on killing to settle op
-posing social and politi
ca
l problems. 
Indeed, 
1968
 proved to be a very bloody year. Two months later, on 
June 
5, Robert Kennedy, while campaigning in California, was assas
-sinated by a deranged Jordanian immigrant, Sirhan Sirhan. Again the 

nat
ion wept. Many people wondered aloud if this country had begun to 
descend into unrecognizable chaos. Later, a study  
showed—to no one’s 
surprise—that the United States sold more ﬁ
rearms than any other 
country on the globe, and its citizens owned more ﬁ
rearms than any 
other people. Worse, more Americans died from ﬁ
rearms than was 
true in any other industrial nation. It was an unenviable record, but 

since the Second Amendment to the Constitution guaranteed the right 

to bear arms, the government made no serious attempt to control the 

distribution of guns, since so many citizens owned weapons and did not 

wish their right infringed in any way. Po
liti
cally, it guaranteed defeat at 
the polls for any ofﬁcial to attempt to enact controlling legislation. 
To make matters even more alarming, the Demo
cratic Nominating 
Convention, meeting in Chicago between August 
26 and 
29, became a 
battleground between the city’s police and angry antiwar protesters. 
279 Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
Security forces, a  
barbed-
wire fence, and checkpoints ringed the Inter
-national Amphitheater, where the convention was held. Radicalized 
studen
ts taunted the police and sang “We Shall Overcome,” the civil 
rights anthem, and  
were peppered with tear gas by the infuriated po
-lice. Tele
vision cameras recorded the mayhem, to the shock and amaze
-ment of the national viewing public. Police used clubs indiscriminately, 
and
 cameramen, journalists, and bystanders 
were assaulted. According 
to a later investigation, what happened was a “police riot.” Despite the 

mayhem in the streets, the delegates inside the convention hall nomi
-nated Hubert Humphrey, the Vice President under Johnson, once Sen
-ator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the brother of John F. and 

Robert F
. Kennedy, chose not to run. Senator Edmund S. Muskie of 
Maine was named to complete the ticket. The Republicans, meeting in 

Miami, had an easier time of it, and on August 
8 chose Richard M. 
Nixon and Spiro Agnew, the governor of Mary
land, to stand as their 
nominees. 
More than likely, the “police riot” in Chicago helped win the election 
fo
r Nixon in a very close contest. Nixon garnered 
31,004
,304
 pop
ular 
votes to Humphrey’s 
30,691
,699. The margin of difference was 
0.01 percent. George C. Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, who was 

the candidate of the American In
de pen
dent Party, a southern conserva
-tive or
ganizati
on, won 
9,787
,691
 pop
ular votes. All told, Nixon captured 
32 states for an electoral vote of 
301 to Humphrey’s 
14 states and 
191 elec
-toral votes. Wallace had 
46 elect
oral votes from ﬁ
ve southern states. 
E a r ly in Februa ry 1969
, th
e Vietcong launched a new, ferocious 
offensive and inﬂ
icted heavy losses on U.S. forces. To impede commu
-nist operations in Vietnam, Nixon secretly ordered an intense bombing 

of C
ambodia. Demonstrations around the country mounted in number 
and even Congress became more vocal in demanding the withdrawal 

of U.S. troops. “The Americans who have died in Vietnam will not 

have died in vain,” declared one Congressman, “if their deaths have 

taught the United States to mind its own business and to lead the world 

by its example.” Finally, Nixon announced that 
25,000 troops would be 
withdrawn by August and a timetable would be devised to bring the 

war to a speedy end. He also expressed the need to make progress at 
280 a short history of the united states 
the negotiations in Paris. By this time it was estimated that millions 
had tak
en part in massive antiwar demonstrations. 
Then, on November 
17, 196
9, Seymour Hersh reported in the 
New 
York Times
 that American troops had been responsible for the massacre 
of more than 
100
 South Viet
nam
ese  
civilians—women, children, and 
the  
elderly—in the village of My Lai in Quang Ngai province in 
March 
1968
. A horriﬁ
ed nation demanded an accounting. Several sol
-diers, among them Lieutenant William Calley,  
were cou
rt-
martialed. 
In March 
1971
 Calley was convicted of premeditated murder of at least 
twenty-
two Viet
nam
ese citizens and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
But his sentence was later reduced, and he was released after serving 

only three and a half years. His commanding ofﬁ
cer, Captain Ernest 
Medina, whom Calley accused of ordering him to kill the civilians, 

was also tried but found not guilty. 
In an effort to clear out communist sanctuaries along the Cambo
-dian border with South Vietnam, Nixon authorized American troops 

to i
nvade and destroy these sanctuaries on April 
30, 1970
. Then, in late 
December 
1970
, Congress repealed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, and 
the President signed it on January 
31, 1971
. This incursion into Cambodia, along with the expansion of Ameri
-can involvement in a war in Laos, the country that bordered Cambodia 

on
 the north, produced further demonstrations on college campuses. 
One such demonstration, at Kent State in Ohio, resulted in the killing of 

four students who were shot to death by National Guardsmen on May 
4, 1970
. The picture of a terriﬁ
ed, screaming young woman leaning over 
the body of one of these students and pleading for an answer deeply af
-fected the nation. Two more students  
wer
e killed by state police at Jack
-son State College in Mississippi on May 
14. Th
en, on July 
1, 1970
, the 
New York Times
 published the Pentagon Papers. These  
were classiﬁ
 ed documents that detailed decisions leading to the United States’ involve
-ment in Vietnam. The 
Times
 had obtained them from Daniel Ellsberg, 
a former Defense Department employee, and their publication further 

eroded conﬁ
dence in the war and the administration’s handling of it. In 
addition, the Pentagon Papers made the administration extremely para
-noid about information being leaked to the media. The administration 

beca
me more secretive and more determined to spy on the activities of 
citizens where leaks 
were suspected. 
281 
Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
But the President scored an important  
breakthrough in foreign af
-fairs when, in February 
1972
, he v
isited Communist China and agreed 
to a joint communiqué on the need for greater interaction between 
China and the United States. Only a  
well-
known anticommunist like 
Nixon could have executed such a historic diplomatic coup. Then, af
-ter extended negotiations in Paris, an agreement between North Viet
-nam and South Vietnam and between the United States and the 

Vi
etcong’s Provisional Revolutionary Government of North Vietnam 
was reached on January 
27, 1973
, to end the Vietnam War. Not surpris
-ingly, the fragile South Viet
nam
ese government soon collapsed, the 
country was overrun by the Vietcong, and the remaining Americans in 

Saigon had to be hurriedly evacuated by he
licop 
ter. It was a  
soul-
searing 
defeat for the American nation, and the domino effect so feared by 

Johnson did not occur. It should have been a lesson that would not 

need to be relearned. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Too many 

ofﬁ
cials in authority knew little about American history. 
After the United States ceased its bombing of Cambodia, the 
com
munist-
led Khmer Rouge seized control of the country. Again, 
American citizens and the embassy staff had to be rescued by heli
cop
-ter. A bloody purge ensued, ending on April 
17, 197
5, when the  
pro-
West 
forces in Cambodia surrendered to the forces of the Khmer Rouge. 
A s the pr esident i a l 
elec
tion of 
1972
 approached, the adminis
-tration became involved in an operation so stupid and criminal that it 
woul
d destroy the reputations of many of the participants. It was one of 
the worst scandals in American history, and it began to unfold on the 

night of June 
17, 1972
, when ﬁ
ve men  
were caught at 
2:30
 AM in a 
burglary attempt at the ofﬁ
ce of the Demo
cratic National Committee 
in the Watergate, an 
apartment-
hotel complex in Washington ad
jacent 
to the Potomac River. As was quickly learned, these men had connec
-tions to the White  
Ho
use and the Republican National Committee to 
Reelect the President (CREEP), and they 
were attempting to gain in
-formation that could be used in the forthcoming election. Ironically, 

Ni
xon and his running mate, Spiro Agnew, overwhelmingly defeated 
the Demo
cratic ticket: Senator George McGovern and R. Sargent 
Shriver, a  
brother-
in-
law of the Kennedys. Nixon and Agnew won 
282 
a short history of the united states 
every state but Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, for a total 
of 520
 electoral and 
47,169
,911
 pop
ular votes to 
17 electoral and 
29,170,383 
pop
ular votes for McGovern and Shriver. Nixon garnered over 
60 per
-cent of the pop 
ul
ar vote, to 
37.5 percent for McGovern. It was a sizable 
victory for the Republican  
ticket—the 
third-
highest electoral total in 
the history of presidential elections—but would soon end in one of the 

most notable defeats any president had ever sustained. 
In Congress there was mounting opposition to the President’s habit 
of i
mpounding funds for programs enacted by the legislature that he did 
not approve. Earlier, Nixon had tried and failed to get Congress to give 

him authority to decide where spending cuts should be made. So he 

bypassed Congress and simply blocked execution of the appropriations 

where he disapproved. Several leaders of the Demo
cratic majority pro
-tested. They pointed out that the constitutional balance  between the 

ex
ecutive and legislative branches was being eroded, that Nixon was 
involved in an outright and improper encroachment of congressional 

authority, that he was violating the fundamental law of the land. 
Congress also resented the President’s exercise of his authority as 
com
mander in chief to involve the nation in foreign wars without the 
approval of the legislature. It ﬁ
nally decided to act, despite threats of a 
presidential veto. In 
1973
 it passed the War Powers Resolution, which 
required the chief executive to consult with Congress before commit
-ting troops in any hostilities. It further required the termination of any 

mi
litary engagement within sixty days unless Congress declared war or 
authorized a continuation of the engagement. Nixon vetoed the resolu
-tion, arguing that it violated his constitutional obligations, but on 

Novemb
er 
7, 1973
, Congress overrode the veto. The War Powers Act 
became law without the President’s signature and has been regularly 

ignored or bypassed by subsequent chief executives. 
The increasing awareness of Nixon’s disregard of constitutional lim
-itations on the presidency was suddenly overshadowed by the problems 

beset
ting the Vice President. Spiro Agnew was indicted on the charge 
of accepting payoffs from construction company executives while gov
-ernor of Mary
la
nd and while Vice President. The case was settled when 
Agnew pleaded no contest to a single charge of income tax 
evasion on 
October 
10, 1973
. It was part of a plea bargain, and he resigned his 
ofﬁ
ce as Vice President of the United States. 
283 
Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
Since the  
Twenty-
ﬁfth Amendment to the Constitution provided 
that the President nominate a replacement for the Vice President when 
the position became vacant, Nixon chose Gerald R. Ford, the minority 

leader of the  
House of Representatives. Both the Senate and the  
House 
conﬁ
rmed the appointment, and Ford assumed the ofﬁ
ce of Vice Pres
-ident. 
Of par 
tic 
ular importance 
in 1973
 was the decision of the 
Supreme Court in 
Roe v. Wade
. The Court struck down state anti- 
abortion laws as a violation of the right of privacy guaranteed under the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The court afﬁ
 rmed a 
woman’s right to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The 

ruling stated that during the ﬁ
rst three months of pregnancy any gov
-ernment interference with a woman’s decision to abort the child was 

un
constitutional. During the next three months a state may legislate to 
protect a woman’s health, and during the ﬁ
nal three months the state 
could forbid abortion. As a result of this decision the number of legal 

abortions quickly multiplied, setting off a national debate between those 

who opposed abortion and called themselves  pro-
life and those who 
favored a choice. Organizations  
were formed by both sides, and every 
future appointment to the Supreme Court brought concern as to a can-

didate’s position on the 
Roe
 decision. 
National politics soon 
overshadowed all other issues. The at
-tempted burglary at the Watergate quickly assumed momentous pro
-portions. Nixon repeatedly denied any involvement in the  break-
in, ev
en though there was an extensive 
cover-
up, orchestrated by the White 
House, to protect the  would-be burglars. Perjury, obstruction of justice, 

and bribery  
were just a few of the crimes the White  
House allegedly 
committed. The burglars came before John J. Sirica, the chief judge of 

the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia. Five of them pleaded 

guilty, and a jury found two others guilty. During the trial, it became 

evident that two of the President’s closest advisers, H. R. Haldeman 

and John R. Ehrlichman, 
were involved in a 
cover-
up, and on April 
30, 1973
, Nixon announced their resignation, along with that of John Dean, 
284 
a short history of the united states 
his legal counsel, and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst, who was 
repl
aced by the secretary of defense, Elliot Richardson. 
Early in 
1973
 the Senate had voted to create a committee to investi
-gate activities during the presidential campaign of 
197
2. Senator Sam J. 
Ervin Jr. of North Carolina headed the committee. This Senate 

Watergate Committee commenced public hearings on May 
17, and its 
televised proceedings attracted national attention. During the hear
-ings, from June 
25 to J
une 
29, John Dean, recently ﬁ
red, revealed that 
Nixon had been party to the  cover-
up. In addition, Alexander Butter
-ﬁeld, a former presidential aide, informed the committee on July 
16 that since 
1971
 the President had  
tape-
recorded all his conversations in 
the White  
House and the Executive Ofﬁ
ce Building. Although Nixon 
vowed publicly, “I am not a crook,” he knew that the tapes would prove 

otherwise. Among other things, the committee learned that the White 

House kept an “Enemies List” of politicians, journalists, and other 

public ﬁ
gures to be used for possible investigation by the Internal Rev
-enue Ser
vice, and a “Plumbers” unit which involved wiretaps of sus
-pects in order to stop press leaks. 
Both the Senate committee and Judge Sirica subpoenaed the tapes. 
The
y were to be turned over to the special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, 
a professor at Harvard Law School and former Solicitor General in the 

Kennedy and Johnson administrations, who had been appointed by 

Attorney General Richardson in May. On July 
23, knowing what 
the tapes contained, Nixon refused to surrender them, citing executive 

privilege. These subpoenas, he insisted, constituted “such a massive 

invasion of presidential conversations that the institution of the presi
-dency itself would be fatally compromised” if he complied. But, on 

Aug
ust 
29, Judge Sirica ordered nine tapes to be delivered to him for 
private review. Instead, Nixon offered transcripts, which he himself 

would edit and Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi would verify. 

Cox refused the offer, whereupon the President ordered Richardson to 

ﬁre Cox. Rather than obey the order, Richardson resigned on Satur
-day, October 
20. Th
e recently appointed Deputy Attorney General, 
William Ruckelshaus, also declined to discharge Cox, and Nixon ﬁ
 red him. Finally Nixon got the Solicitor General, Robert H. Bork, next in 

line to become acting attorney general, to do his dirty work. Bork dis
-missed Cox during this 
so-ca
lled “Saturday night massacre” of October 
285 
Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
20, 1973
. A Texan trial lawyer, Leon Jaworski, was then appointed spe
-cial prosecutor, replacing Cox. 
There  
were no
w calls for Nixon’s impeachment, and the  
House Ju
-diciary Committee initiated an inquiry. Although a number of 
Ho
use members objected to any consideration of impeachment, sixteen such 
resolutions  were submitted by  
eighty-
four members for consideration 
by the Judiciary Committee. With mounting public demand and the 

threat of impeachment increasing, Nixon ﬁ
nally agreed to comply with 
the subpoena and he released some of the tapes. One of them revealed 

a gap of eigh
teen and a half minutes, which experts later decided was 
caused by multiple erasures. This gap involved a conversation between 

Nixon and Haldeman on June 
20, 1972
. The  
House Judiciary Committee of 
thirty-
eight members, chaired 
by Peter Rodino of New Jersey, began its hearings on October 
30, 1973
. Five months later a Watergate grand jury indicted seven of Nixon’s 

former advisers and aides, and Judge Sirica subsequently directed that 

the evidence be turned over to the Judiciary Committee. It included a 

sealed report that apparently cited Nixon as a co-conspirator in the Wa
-tergate  
cover-
up. On April 
11, th
e impeachment committee voted 
33 to 3 to subpoena 
the tapes of conversations held in February, March, and April 
1973
. Five 
days later Special Prosecutor Jaworski issued a subpoena for  
sixty-
four 
tapes to be used in the trials of the indicted advisers and aides. Nixon 

refused, but on April 
30 he released over 
1,000 pages of edited conversa
-tions. The committee rejected his edited version of what it had asked for 

an
d demanded the tapes. In a letter to Rodino, Nixon said he was “de
-termined to do nothing which . . . 
woul
d render the executive branch 
henceforth and forever more subservient to the legislative branch, and 

would thereby destroy the constitutional balance.” 
The President was certain that the Supreme Court would uphold his 
op
inion when Jaworski appealed to it for a decision, since he, Nixon, 
had appointed nearly a majority of the justices. But on July 
24, 1974
, the 
Court unanimously (with William Rehnquist abstaining) agreed in an 

opinion written by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger that the President 

must surrender evidence in what was obviously a criminal proceeding. 
Three days later, on July 
27, 197
4, the Judiciary Committee’s articles of 
impeachment 
were approved. Nixon was charged with having “engaged 
286 a short history of the united states 
personally and through his subordinates . . . 
to
 delay, impede, and ob
-struct” the Watergate investigation, conceal evidence, and protect indi
-viduals engaged in criminal activity. He was also accused of “violating 
th
e constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper ad
-ministration of justice in the conduct of lawful inquiries, and of contra
-vening the law governing agencies of the executive branch, and the 

pu
rposes of these agencies.” Furthermore, he was charged with deﬁ
 ance 
of committee subpoenas, thus impeding the impeachment pro cess. 
On August 
5, Ni
xon released the transcripts of three conversations 
with Haldeman recorded on June 
22, 1972
, conversations that had oc
-curred six days after the  
bre
ak-
in and proved to be what was called the 
“smoking gun.” The “smoking gun” revealed that Nixon had been 

aware of the  
cover-
up and had personally ordered a halt to the FBI in
-vestigation into the Watergate burglary. In addition, the vulgarity of 

th
e language used by the President on these tapes shocked the nation. 
They revealed a foulmouthed bigot who had disgraced his ofﬁ
 ce. The 
general public now realized the extent of Nixon’s betrayal of his oath to 

preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. 
The impeachment pro 
ces
s now moved to the full 
House, and on 
August 
7, 1974,
 the members voted to allow live radio and tele
vision 
coverage of the impeachment debate. But Nixon was frankly told by 

several leaders of the Republican Party that he could expect no more 

than ten votes against impeachment in the  
House and no more than 
ﬁfteen in the Senate against his removal. 
The next day, having little choice, Nixon announced his resignation 
on te
levision, declaring that he “no longer had a strong enough politi
cal 
base” to continue in ofﬁ
ce. The resignation took effect the following 

day, August 
9, at which time Gerald Ford took the oath of ofﬁ
 ce. One 
of the ﬁ
rst things President Ford did was nominate Nelson Rockefel
ler of New York to serve as Vice President. The nomination was approved 

by both 
houses of Congress in accordance with the procedure outlined 
in the  
Twenty-
ﬁfth Amendment to the Constitution. “Our long na
-tional nightmare is over,” Ford declared. “Our great republic is a gov
-ernment of laws and not of men.” 
This was the ﬁ
rst time in American history that both the President 
and Vice President advanced to the highest level of the executive branch 

of the government without being elected by the people. 
287 
Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
A month later, on September 
8, 1974
, to the shock and anger of 
many, Ford gave Nixon a full and unconditional presidential pardon. 
He denied that a “deal” had been struck at the time of his elevation in 

testimony given to the  
House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal 
Justice on October 
17. Rather, he insisted, it was his wish to end the 
controversy over Watergate and restore peace to the country. But a 

great many of the electorate found it difﬁ
cult to accept the fact of the 
pardon, and they noted that the speed with which it was given and the 

failure to prepare the public for it beforehand gave credence to the ac
-cusation of another “corrupt bargain.” Ford would pay the price for his 

action at the next presidential election in 
1976
, but by the time of his 
death in 
2006 many Americans had come to believe that what he had 
said was true, that there had been no “deal,” and that the nation needed 

to heal and be done with the Watergate scandal. 
Two attempts on the life of Gerald Ford 
were made in
 September 
1975
. Fortunately, both failed. On September 
5, Lynette Fromme 
pointed a Colt .
45-caliber handgun loaded with four bullets at Ford but 
was apprehended before she could shoot. Then, on September 
22, Sara 
Jane Moore ﬁ
red a single shot at Ford as he was leaving the St. Francis 
Hotel in San Francisco. A bystander, Oliver Simple, grabbed her arm 

as she pulled the trigger and deﬂ
ected the bullet. Ford again escaped 
possible injury or death. Although given a life sentence, Moore was 

pardoned on December 
31, 2007, after  
thirty-
two years in prison. 
It is not clear whether either attempt was motivated in part by the 
pardon or by the fact that Nixon never confessed his guilt, although he 
did admit making mistakes. Actually, his ac cep
tance of the pardon was 
interpreted by many as an admission of guilt. Although he himself es
-caped trial and possible imprisonment for his crimes, his aides  
were accused
, tried, and convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, per
-jury, and violating federal campaign laws. They received varying prison 

sent
ences. Later, in 
1975
, investigations by congressional committees 
revealed that the CIA had conducted extensive and illegal intelligence 

operations during the Nixon administration. 
There  
were tw
o important results from the Watergate debacle. The 
ﬁrst was passage of the Campaign Finance Act in 
1974
, which estab
-lished spending limits and required full disclosure of campaign contri
-butions and expenses. The second was the overwhelming defeat of 
288 
a short history of the united states 
Republicans in both the midterm election of 
197
4 and the presidential 
election of 
1976
. The year 
1976
 brought not only a presidential election but also the 
bicentennial of the signing of the Declaration of In
de pen
dence on July 
4, 1776
. The nation celebrated the event with many festive events and 
parades, including an impressive display of sailing ships in New York 
Harbor. It proved to be a welcome relief from all the scandals and vio
-lence that had taken place during the past several years. 
Demo
crats not only celebrated July 
4 but keenly looked forward to 
the approaching presidential election. There  were numerous candi
-dates, but Governor Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer from Plains, Geor
-gia, won a series of primaries early in the campaign and went on to take 

the
 nomination at the Demo
cratic National Convention in New York 
City on July 
15. The fact that Hubert Humphrey had withdrawn as a 
candidate eliminated the  
best-
known possible rival. Carter then chose 
Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. 
The Republicans chose Ford, despite a strong bid to replace him by 
Rona
ld Reagan, the governor of California. In place of Rocke
fel
ler, who 
withdrew, the convention named Senator Robert Dole of Kansas to run 

for Vice President. Even though Carter enjoyed many advantages during 

the 
contest—especially the soaring inﬂ
ation, the Watergate scandal, and 
the pardon of 
Nixon—he barely won the election. He received 
40,829
,056 pop
ular and 
297 electoral votes to Ford’s 
39,146
,006 pop
ular and 
240
 elec
-toral 
votes—a 
2.1 percent difference. The Democratic Party also retained 
control of both 
houses of Congress, electing 
292 House members, to 
143 
Republicans. In the Senate the Demo
crats held a 
62 to 38 advantage. 
The Speaker of the  
Ho
use, Thomas P. (Tip)  
O’Neill of Massachu
-setts, met Jimmy Carter in Georgia after the election to discuss policy. 

The 
President-
elect explained his wish to conserve energy and his desire 
to see conservation enacted by Congress. The Speaker wisely recom
-mended that he consult with committee chairmen about any of his proj
-ects. But Carter foolishly dismissed the suggestion, claiming there was no 

ne
ed. If necessary, he said, he would appeal over the heads of the chair
-men to the people. At that moment, Tip knew they 
were in trouble. 
During the inauguration on January 
20, 197
7, Carter broke with 
tradition and, after the  
swearing-
in ceremony, he and his wife walked 
down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White  
House, 
289 
Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
rather than being driven. Apparently he wanted to convey a more 
populist image, one that eschewed formality. 
But the new president did not have a strong staff; nor was he able to 
bui
ld pop 
ular approval. Worse, he failed to win support among Demo
-crats in Congress. None of his proposals on welfare, energy, and taxes 

were enact
ed in the form he set forth. Thus, despite large majorities in 
both 
houses of Congress, little of note was accomplished during the 
Carter administration. Even Republican lawmakers  
were mystiﬁ
 ed. The 
President would inform the members about what he wanted, declared 

one Republican, “and that was the end of it.” There was no 
follow-
through, 
no active participation in the lawmaking pro
cess. Carter was good at de
-tail, trying to micromanage the pro cess, “but he didn’t have a clear vision 

fo
r the country, and he wound up judging the Congress and not leading 
it.” One Demo
crat said that Carter knew “more about more things than 
any President in the history of the United States
. . . . 
And yet . . .  
he . . . 
didn’t pat you on the back, he just didn’t get along with people.” 
In attempting to micromanage his administration, Carter found it an 
im
possible task, and only produced a lack of conﬁ
dence in his leadership 
by the public. Tip  
O’Neill claimed that Carter’s leadership style also 
resulted in the loss of twelve 
House seats and three Senate seats in the 
midterm election of 
1978
. Carter also held a particularly unfortunate 
ten- 
day domestic eco
-nomic summit at Camp David, a presidential retreat in Maryland, to 

de
al with mounting inﬂ
ation and what he regarded as an energy crisis. 
Over a hundred participants of different backgrounds attended. In a 

televised speech on July 
15, 1979
, he described what others called a na
-tional malaise, although he termed it a “crisis of conﬁ
de
nce” because of 
economic conditions in the country. It set a tone that profoundly dis
-couraged the nation. He also reshufﬂ
ed hi
s cabinet and forced the res
-ignations of several members. 
Inﬂ
ation remained a problem, and when oil prices 
rose sharply in 
1979
 the Consumer Price Index registered an annual price rise of al
-most 
18 percent. Gasoline prices climbed over the $
1-per-
gallon mark. 
The Federal Reserve Board raised the prime interest rate to a high of 

twenty percent in order to reduce the amount of money available for 

loans. And installment buying was discouraged by additional restric
-tions on consumer credit. 
290 a short history of the united states 
To make matters worse for the Carter administration, a “sting” 
op
eration conducted by the FBI revealed that a number of congressmen 
took bribes in return for ofﬁcial favors. A front or
ganization, called Ab
-dul Enterprises Ltd. (Abscam was the name of the sting), solicited busi
-ness by claiming that its agents represented Arab businessmen who  were 
prepa
red to offer bribes for legislative favors. FBI agents dressed as Arab 
sheikhs videotaped their meetings with congressmen. A number of 

members 
were indicted and found guilty in 
1980
 and 
1981
. Several re
-signed and others  
were defea
ted for reelection. Michael Myers, a Demo
-cratic representative from Pennsylvania, was the ﬁ
rst t
o be convicted of 
bribery, conspiracy, and interstate travel to aid racketeering; and on Oc
-tober 
2, 1980
, he had the dubious distinction of being the ﬁ
rst member to 
be expelled from the 
House since 
1861
. Even Carter himself and his 
brother Billy  
were investigated but cleared by a federal special prosecutor 
of possible loan violations in connection with their peanut business. 
Although things went steadily downhill for the Carter administra
-tion, in foreign affairs there  
were sever
al successes. The President 
signed a Panama Canal treaty in Washington with the head of the 

Panamanian government which provided for the repeal of the 

Hay-
Bunau-
Varilla Treaty of 
1903
, the turning over of own
ership and 
control of the canal to Panama in 
2000
, and guaranteeing the neutral
-ity of the canal in war and peace. The treaty was ratiﬁ
ed by  two
-thirds 
of the electorate in Panama in a referendum on October 
23, 1977
, but 
just barely by the U.S. Senate on March 
16, 1978
. The Senate vote was 
68 to 32, winning passage by one vote, and only after adding an amend
-ment and reservation that safeguarded the right of the United States to 

pr
otect the canal by force if necessary. 
Regarding the People’s Republic of China, the U.S. entered into for
-mal diplomatic relations in 
197
9, with an exchange of ambassadors, and 
Carter withdrew recognition of the Republic of China in Taiwan and 

renounced the mutual defense treaty between it and the United States. 
Carter’s most notable achievement in foreign affairs was his man
-agement of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. Those two nations 

had be
en at war since 
1973
, when Egypt and other Arab states launched 
a surprise attack on Israel. Under pressure from Washington, President 

Anwar  
el-
Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Is
-rael exchanged visits in 
197
7 but failed to reach an agreement. Then 
291 
Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
Carter invited Sadat and Begin to Camp David in September 
1978
 and 
worked out the Camp David Accords, in which the two belligerents 
agreed to sign a peace treaty within three months. On March 
26, 1979
, in the  
Rose Garden at the White  
House, Begin and Sadat, despite the 
opposition of other Arab states, signed a treaty of peace. It provided for 

the gradual evacuation of the Sinai Peninsula by Israel and the estab
-lishment of normal diplomatic and trade relations. However, it did not 

se
ttle the Palestinian situation in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank of 
the Jordan River. 
Then Carter suffered a particularly devastating blow in Iran. The 
tr
ouble began when the Shah of Iran ﬂ
ed the country after a successful 
revolt by Islamic fundamentalists. When he was admitted to the United 

States on October 
22, 1979
, to obtain medical treatment, Ayatollah 
Khomeini, the Muslim cleric directing the revolt, urged his followers 

to demonstrate. On November 
4, 1979
, hundreds of Ira
nian students 
stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and demanded the return of the 

Shah for trial. They seized and held about 
100
 hostages, most of whom 
were members of the American diplomatic mission. Carter refused to 

extradite the Shah and froze all Ira
nian assets in the United States. 
Two weeks after the hostages  
were taken the students released thirteen 
American women and black men but continued to hold the others. 

Neither the Shah’s exit from the United States to Panama, nor his sub
-sequent death eight months later, nor the requests of the United Na
-tions persuaded the Ira
nians to release the hostages. 
Carter’s pursuit of diplomatic options and his call for worldwide 
econ
omic sanctions against Iran had no effect. So he quietly authorized 
a military operation in the hope of ending the crisis. On April 
24, 1980
, a commando raid ended in failure and the loss of eight lives before the 

would-
be rescuers could even reach Tehran. To the country at large, it 
now seemed that the United States government was utterly helpless. 
Earlier, another crisis had developed when the Soviet  
Un
ion invaded 
Afghan 
istan in December 
1979
, to prop up a faltering and unpop 
ular 
communist regime. Carter responded by placing an embargo on grain 

shipments to Rus
sia and discouraging American athletes from partici
-pating in the Olympic games scheduled to take place in Moscow during 

the
 summer of 
1980
. It seemed that the Cold War was still in full force. 
These developments severely damaged Carter’s drive for a second 
292 
a short history of the united states 
term as President. He was challenged by Senator Edward M. (Ted) 
Ke
nnedy of Massachusetts, the younger brother of John and Robert, 
although this challenge faded after initial successes in the primaries in 

Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York when, in a national tele
vi-sion program, Kennedy failed to explain why he wished to be President. 

Car
ter won renomination at the Democratic National Convention on 
August 
14 in New York City. But he and his running mate, Walter F. 
Mondale, faced a  
hard- 
driving Republican in Ronald Reagan, a former 
movie actor and governor of California, who had attracted widespread 

support from conservatives with his call for lower taxes and a less active 

government. Reagan attacked Carter’s economic and foreign policies 

and advocated what he called “supply-
side”  
economics, that is, the pro
-cess of lowering taxes as a way of achieving prosperity. Reagan’s most 

im
portant challenger for the Republican nomination, George Herbert 
Walker Bush, called “supply-
side” economics “voodoo economics.” 
But Reagan’s charm, relaxed demeanor, and attractive televi
sion 
manner proved unbeatable and he swept to repeated primary victories, 
winning nomination on the ﬁ
rst ballot at the Republican National 
Convention in Detroit on July 
16. After an initial but failed attempt to 
entice Gerald Ford to accept the vice presidential nomination, Reagan 

chose Bush to complete the ticket. It seemed at ﬁ
rst as though the cam
-paign might develop into a close race, but Reagan quickly pulled ahead, 

at
tracting  
blue-
collar workers who had traditionally voted Demo
cratic 
to join him in his conservative crusade to improve economic conditions 

throughout the country. 
The election itself provided an unexpected landslide for Reagan. In 
fact
, so complete was the victory from the outset of the counting that 
Carter conceded the election before the polls closed on the West Coast. 

Many candidates running for lesser ofﬁ
ces in the west felt that they lost 
as a result of Carter’s early concession because Democrats, knowing the 

election was lost, failed to appear at the polls. Reagan took forty-
three 
states, including every southern state except Georgia, for a total of 
489 electoral and 
43,901
,812
 pop
ular votes to Carter’s 
6 states and the Dis
-trict of Columbia for a total 
49 elect
oral and 
35,483
,820
 pop
ular votes. 
The Republican Party also won control of the Senate, although 
Dem
ocrats retained their majority in the  
House. Still, Republicans had 
won  
thirty-
three 
House seats, and because of the  
Dixie-
Republican 
293 
Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
alliance, especially on issues like taxation and big government, the tone 
and style of the lower chamber became increasingly conservative. Many 

of the leading and most inﬂ
uential liberals 
were defeated in the  House. 
The Speaker, Tip  
O’Neill, blamed the resulting defeat directly on 
Carter. “Ronald Reagan didn’t win the 
1980
 election as much as Jimmy 
Carter lost it
. . . . The fact is that by election day a great many Ameri
-cans 
couldn’t wait to get rid of him.” Against a really strong candidate 
in a robust economy, he insisted, “Ronald Reagan would have had no 
more chance of being elected president of the United States than the 

man in the moon.” Perhaps. 
Many Demo
cr
ats in Congress 
were demoralized following this elec
-tion, and they did not look forward to a contest with the pop ular 

Presi
dent over his announced intention of cutting domestic spending 
in order to increase the military bud 
get. But according to those in 
California who knew Reagan fairly well, the  
President-
elect was “all 
bark and no bite.” As governor of California he had actually increased 

spending and raised taxes. 
As it turned out, Reagan never had much interest in the details of 
legisl
ation, but he was a born po
liti
cal inﬁ
ghter. He pleaded with mem
-bers of Congress over the telephone; he buttonholed them on their visits 

to t
he White  
House; he worked through his staff and a “savvy team of 
congressional liaison men”; and he frequently addressed the American 

people on tele
vision, which he employed with consummate skill to sup
-port his program. “All in all,” commented Tip  
O’N
eill, “the Reagan team 
in 1981
 was probably the best run po
liti
cal operating unit I’ve ever seen.” 
For the ﬁ
rst time in American history the inauguration of the Presi
-dent took place on the West Lawn of the Capitol building. In his inau
-gural address, Reagan, the oldest person to be elected chief  
exe
cutive—he 
was less than a month shy of turning  
seventy—declared that “govern
-ment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” 

Fur
thermore, he went on, it was time “to get government back within 
its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden.” Conservatives lis
-tening to him screamed their approval, and from that moment on he 

be
came their enduring hero. 
Minutes after Reagan ﬁ
nish
ed his inaugural address, the  
ﬁ fty-
two 
American hostages in Tehran 
were released by the Ira
nian government 
in what appeared to be a ﬁ
nal rebuke to Jimmy Carter. 
294 a short history of the united states 
It did not take long for the Demo
cr
atic leadership to be overwhelmed 
by the deft po
liti
cal maneuvering of Reagan and his incomparable 
staff. The President inherited an economy crippled by high inﬂ
 ation 
and high interest rates. Indeed, the prime lending rate in 
1981
 ﬂ uctu
-ated between 
20 and 
20.5 percent. For one thing, Reagan insisted on 
strict party discipline. Coupled with the support of southern conserva
-tive Demo
crats, the huge majority “we enjoyed during the Carter years,” 
said Speaker  
O’Neill, “disappeared
. . . . The new president jumped in 
wi
th both feet.” A masterful politician and manipulator, Reagan pro
-vided extraordinary leadership of Congress. Some 
Ho
use members 
claimed that they saw Reagan more during the ﬁ
rst few months of his 
administration than they could recall seeing Carter during his entire 
four years in ofﬁ
 ce. Demo
crats soon discovered they could work with the President. 
They had many arguments, some of which grew very heated, but they 
learned, as Tip  
O’Neill said, “to disagree without being disagreeable.” 
That sentiment inﬁ
 ltrated Congress. “Speaker Tip  
O’Neill and Presi
-dent Reagan would be competitive and partisan in their business deal
-ings and cordial after hours,” reported Donald Sundquist, a Republican 

fr
om Tennessee. And indeed Tip and Reagan regularly met after six 
PM to have a drink together. “And the same was true for most of the 

rest of us. After the  
House adjourned, everybody was decent to each 
other and could share a laugh.” 
As a result, Reagan got his Economic Recovery Act passed in 
1981
, providing a tax cut designed to reduce the size of government and 
stimulate business expansion. It was 
supply- 
side economics writ large. 
An unbelievable total of 
forty-
eight Demo
crats, most of them southern 
conservatives who called themselves “Boll Weevils,” broke ranks with 

their party and voted for the mea
sure, while only one Republican de
-fected. “We saved Ronald Reagan’s programs his ﬁ
rs
t four years,” 
boasted one Boll Weevil. Because there  
were enough Demo
cratic de
-fectors, Republicans “controlled the agenda on economic issues.” Con
-sequently, Medicare beneﬁ
ts
 and student loans  
were lowered, nutrition 
programs for children 
were cut, and unemployment compensation was 
reduced. Passage of the tax bill and the Budget Reconciliation Act, 

which projected reduced spending by the government for the next three 

years, prompted Reagan to declare that his proposals represented “an 
295 Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
end to the excessive growth in government bureaucracy and govern
-ment spending and government taxing.” But the huge loss of revenue 
tha
t resulted forced the administration to ask Congress to raise the 
debt ceiling above the trillion-
dollar mark. And it was done, lifting the 
ceiling to $
1.080 trillion through September 
30, 1982
. By the end of 
1981
, the federal deﬁ
cit was headed beyond $
100
 billion and the econ
-omy was in decline. 
Shortly after taking ofﬁ
ce, Ro
nald Reagan was shot in the chest on 
March 
30, 1981
, at 
2:30
 PM, by  
twenty-
ﬁ ve-year-
old John W. Hinckley 
Jr., while emerging from the Washington Hilton Hotel. Also wounded 

in the attack 
were the Presidential Press Secretary, James S. Brady, a 
Secret Ser
vice ofﬁ
cer, and a police ofﬁ
cer. Rushed to the George Wash
-ington University Hospital, Reagan jokingly expressed the hope that the 

surgeo
n who would perform the operation to extract the bullet was a 
Republican. Fortunately he recovered from the operation and was re
-leased from the hospital on April 
11. Hi
nckley was later found not guilty 
of any crime by reason of insanity and he was duly incarcerated. 
Reagan had no intention of slowing his efforts to increase defense 
spen
ding and reduce taxes and the cost of many domestic programs. 
Indeed, he succeeded in providing the greatest increase in military ap
-propriations in American history, along with the largest tax cuts this 

coun
try ever experienced. Of course these sent the deﬁ
cit soaring; and 
the national debt rocketed into the trillions. Richard Cheney, Republi
-can from Wyoming, later commented that Ronald Reagan proved that 

“de
ﬁcits don’t matter.” Some Americans worried that if “deﬁ
 cits don’t 
matter,” in time the country could face bankruptcy. 
One thing Demo
cr
ats learned about Reagan after several skirmishes 
was the fact that he “would compromise at the right time.” He was not 

perpetually “hard-
nosed,” declared John Murtha, Demo
crat from 
Pennsylvania. On a proposed $
15 billion slash of defense funds, for 
example, “we knew that he was willing to compromise, but he didn’t 

compromise until the end. I mean he fought it right through to the end 

and then he would compromise.” 
But Reagan did succeed in obtaining bud 
get an
d tax cuts sufﬁ
 cient 
to alter government policy signiﬁ
cantly. Personal income taxes  
were reduced  
twenty-
ﬁve percent across the board over  
thirty-
three months. 
Beginning in 
1985
, tax rates, personal exemptions, and regular deductions 
296 a short history of the united states 
were to be indexed to reﬂ
ect cost o
f living increases. In addition, the 
capital gains tax was reduced from 
28 to 20 percent, and the amounts 
to be excluded from estate and gift taxes 
were increased. As for the 
budget, such areas as education, health, housing, environment, food 
stamps, school meals, the National Endowment for the Arts and Hu
-manities, and urban aid programs  
were sla
shed. On the other hand, 
Reagan won huge appropriations for the military. The defense bud
get was increased from $
180
 billion to $
279 billion. Funds 
were provided 
to rebuild the navy, purchase bombers and missiles, and construct a 
space-based strategic defense system, popularly known as “Star Wars.” 
Consequently the deﬁ
cit soared from $
79 billion in 
1981
 to $
185
 billion 
in 1986
, obliging Reagan to abandon one of his most important prin
-ciples and ask Congress to raise taxes. Even with this increase, the 

deﬁ ci
t rose to a high of $
290
 billion, and the national debt tripled. 
Modern methods of 
accom
plishing goals changed many of the 
ways Americans lived and how their government functioned. For ex
-ample, tele
visio
n provided Americans with entertainment, informa
-tion, and access to places they never knew existed and events that they 

ne
ver  expected to witness. For one thing, the public for the ﬁ
 rst time 
could literally watch laws enacted in Congress. The beginning of pub
-lic tele
vision came when the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network 
(C-Span) introduced continuous coverage of Congress, both 
House 
and Senate. Speaker  
O’Neill said that permitting live, televised cover
-age of the debates in the  
Ho
use of Representatives was “one of the best 
decisions I ever made.” The electorate came to realize that many of 

their representatives  
were hardworking and intelligent men and women. 
This medium also provided members with a means of communicating 

directly with their constituents back home. But one obvious disadvan
-tage was the fact that members who in the past spent a good part of the 

da
y on the chamber ﬂ
oor listening to the arguments put forward by 
their colleagues now watched them intermittently on tele
vision from 
their ofﬁ
 ces. Gone 
were the great days of congressional debate when a 
Daniel Webster, a Henry Clay, a John C. Calhoun, a Thaddeus Ste
-vens, a William Jennings Bryan could mesmerize an audience, inﬂ
 u-ence voting, and demonstrate the qualities of statesmanship. 
297 Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
It did not take much imagination for some members to recognize 
that tele
vision provided an excellent means of attacking the opposition. 
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia was particularly astute in 
recognizing how tele
vision could assist him and his Republican col
-leagues to wrest control of the  
Ho
use of Representatives from the 
Demo
crats. “I ﬁ
gured out [that] if I could start making speeches on 
C-Span, then I would reach a dramatically bigger audience than people 

who ﬂ
 ew ﬁ
ve hundred miles to speak to a Kiwanis club.” He and a 
small band of followers began delivering short  
one-
minute jabs at the 
Demo
crats in the morning and longer “Special Order” jabs in the eve
-ning. Special Orders entitle a member to take the ﬂ
oor a
fter the  
House 
has ﬁ
nished its business and speak for an hour on any subject he or she 
desired. The  
House is usually empty by that time, and the speeches 
were normally intended for home consumption. But Gingrich used them 

to charge that the 
House had been corrupted under Democratic rule. 
He said the opposition was “ruthlessly partisan in changing the rules of 

the  
House, stacking committees . . .  and questioning the [Reagan] ad
-ministration.” 
The number of 
one-
minute speeches by members in the morning 
increased from 
110
 in March 
1977
 to 344
 by March 
1981
. Unfortunately, 
this type of activity only generated incivility within the chamber and 

drove members apart. It “will poison the national dialogue and cripple 

domestic debate,” predicted David Obey, Demo
crat from Wisconsin. 
And indeed it did. Gradually the poison of confrontation and per
-sonal attack, rather than compromise and bipartisanship, worked its 

wa
y through the legislature and within a short period of time destroyed 
all vestiges of courtesy and civility among the members of Congress. A 

new era had begun, an era of partisanship that would dominate debates 

for the remainder of the twentieth century and would continue into the 

twenty-
ﬁ rst century. 
Tension between the 
Un
ited States and the Soviet  
Union esca
-lated during the Reagan administration. Referring to communist 

Rus sia as
 an “evil empire,” the President initiated restrictions that sus
-pended trade between the two countries involving electronic equip
-ment, computers, and other advanced technology. On a trip to Europe 
298 a short history of the united states 
in June 
1982
, Reagan spoke to a joint session of the two  
houses of the 
British  
Parliament—the ﬁ
rst such speech a U.S. president had ever 
given to that 
body—and then visited the Berlin Wall, calling on the 
communists to “tear down this wall.” 
So anxious  
were Re
agan and his colleagues in the White  
House to 
block Soviet aggression that he allowed his aides to become involved in 
an attempt to overthrow the Marxist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. 

They cooked up a scheme to provide military assistance and funds to 

the counterrevolutionary  
anti-
Sandinista, or Contra, forces. Twice, in 
1982
 and 
1983
, Congress barred assistance to the Contras, and in an 
amendment (the Boland Amendment) to a spending bill, passed on 

October 
12, 1984
, it forbade the Pentagon, the CIA, and other intelli
-gence agencies from furnishing “miliary equipment, military training 

or adv
ice, or other support for military activities, to any group or 
individual . . .  
for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Ni
-caragua.” This amendment was renewed in 
1985
 and extended through 
the 
1986 
ﬁ scal year. 
To circumvent this restriction, the administration used funds from 
se
cret arms sales to Iran, along with other ﬁ
nancial assistance provided 
by foreign governments and private individuals, to support the Contra 

effort to overthrow the Sandinistas. This ploy began in the spring of 

1985
, when Israeli intelligence informed the American government that 
Shiite Muslims  
were willing to assist the release of foreign hostages 
held in Lebanon in exchange for arms to be sold to Iran. On January 
17, 1986
, Reagan approved covert arms sales to Iran through the CIA. He 
ordered the CIA Director, William J. Casey, not to tell Congress about 

it, thus initiating a systematic conspiracy to deceive Congress and cover 

up the activities of members of the National Security Council, an 

agency ﬁ
rst established in 
1947
, who  
were funneling the funds to the 
Contras. 
What was happening was clearly a violation of the law, and an im
-peachable offense for those involved. When some of the details of this 

scandal leaked out, the President, on November 
2, appointed a  
three-
man commission, headed by a former Texas Senator, John Tower, a 

Republican, to look into the matter. The commission later identiﬁ
 ed Robert MacFarlane, former director of the National Security Council; 

his successor, Rear Admiral John M. Poindexter; and his aide, Lieu
-299 
Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
tenant Col 
onel Oliver North, along with Casey, as the men responsible 
for arranging the sale to Iran and diverting the proﬁ
 ts from the sale to 
the rebels ﬁ
ghting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The com
-mission also criticized Reagan for failing to keep abreast and in control 
of wha
t was happening in his administration. A joint  
House and Sen
-ate report also accused the President of permitting a “cabal of zealots” 

to
 engage in activities that deﬁ
ed the law. Once the scandal became 
public, Oliver North systematically shredded all written evidence be
-fore Congress could subpoena the documents. 
So ﬂ
 agrant 
were these violations that a number of Demo
cratic con
-gressmen demanded the impeachment of the President. But calmer 

he
ads opposed the move. “I have lived through the impeachment of 
Nixon,” said Jim Wright, the majority leader in the  
House of Repre
-sentatives, “and I didn’t want to see that revived in our country again.” 
The investigations by Congress produced convincing evidence that 
th
e Reagan administration had “lied to and deceived Congress and the 
public, scorned the constitutional rights and responsibilities of Con
-gress in the conduct of foreign policy; [and] abdicated the conduct of 

th
at policy to private, 
proﬁ t-seeking persons.” But, said Speaker Tip 
O’Neill, “we’re not going to go through another impeachment. It’s too 

hard on the country.  
We’re not going to do it.” 
Reagan accepted full responsibility for the  
Iran
-Contra affair, de
-claring that he had sent aid to Iran in the hope of improving relations, 

no
t to free hostages in Lebanon. Aides swore that he had not been 
informed of the secret arrangements for funneling funds to the Con
-tras. Meanwhile, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Co
-lumbia appointed Lawrence E. Walsh as in
de pen
dent counsel, and his 
investigations led to the indictment of fourteen individuals, all of 

whom 
were convicted. Poindexter resigned, North was ﬁ
red, and both 
men were indicted. On May 
4, 1989
, North was convicted of three 
felonies, including destroying and falsifying ofﬁ
 cial 
documents, 
though he was acquitted of nine other charges. He was ﬁ
 ned and put 
on probation for two years, but a federal judge overturned the ﬁ
 ndings 
and dismissed the charges. A federal appeals court also threw out the 

felony convictions of Poindexter. MacFarlane pleaded guilty to four 

counts of illegally withholding evidence from Congress and was sen
-tenced to two years’ probation and a $
20,000 ﬁne. President George 
300 a short history of the united states 
Herbert Walker Bush pardoned two others in 
199
2. Caspar Wein
-berger, the secretary of defense, was charged with four counts of per
-jury and making false statements, but President Bush pardoned him as 
well. 
In his ﬁ
nal report Lawrence Walsh stated that there was no credible 
evidence that Reagan himself had violated any criminal statute. “Nev
-ertheless, he set the stage for the illegal activities of others by encour
-aging and, in general terms, ordering support of the Contras . . . when 

fu
nds for the Contras  were cut off by the Boland amendment.” Most 
probably, Jim Wright later said, Reagan “was not really focused on 

what he was saying” to his aides or agreeing to, “and had no memory 

of it.” 
In foreign relations 
Re
agan felt obliged to send troops to 
Lebanon in 
1983
 as part of an international peacekeeping force to help 
quell a raging civil war that had brought the country to 
near-
ruin. But 
his efforts failed. On October 
23, 1983
, a suicide bomber crashed his 
truck, laden with explosives, into the U.S. Marines barracks and killed 
241
 American ser
vicemen. The President promptly withdrew the re
-maining troops from the country. Despite this tragic disaster, Reagan 

him
self suffered no po
liti
cal ill effects. He remained as pop 
ular as ever. 
Thereafter he was known as the Teﬂ
on President, because nothing po
-liti
cally unfavorable could stick to him. 
He enjoyed one ﬁ
nal su
ccess in foreign affairs when he agreed with 
the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, to end the deployment of 

intermediate-
range nuclear forces (INFs) in Eu
rope. On assuming 
power as chairman of the Soviet Communist Party in 
1985
 Gorbachev 
inherited severe economic problems that required a different direction 

for Rus
sia. He announced a new policy of “openness,” or glasnost, to 
rid the country of 
Soviet-
style secretiveness and repression. He advo
-cated a form of free speech and a certain degree of po
liti
cal freedom. In 
addition, he proposed a policy of “restructuring,” or perestroika, by 

which the failing Soviet economy could be improved by adopting 

free-
market policies of western capitalistic societies. 
To achieve the goals of glasnost and perestroika, Gorbachev had to 
cu
t the size of the Soviet military apparatus and redirect Russia’s eco
-301 Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
nomic activities. That meant lessening the tension and bitterness be
-tween the Soviet  
Un
ion and the free  
world—in short, to end the Cold 
War. Moreover, the arms buildup of the United States under Reagan 
placed a heavy strain on the Soviet economy and the ability of the Rus
-sians to maintain an equal balance of military power. So Gorbachev 

ex
tended a welcoming hand to Reagan by offering to cease the deploy
-ment of intermediate-range nuclear forces aimed at Eu
rope
. The Presi
-dent responded favorably, and after several meetings the two leaders 

agr
eed in Washington in December 
1987
 to the INF Treaty banning all 
intermediate-
range missiles targeted on western Europe. In effect, this 
treaty marked the end of the Cold War and the beginning of friendlier 

relations between the Soviet  
Union and the West. 
Not only did 
the 
Iran-
Contra scandal mar the Reagan legacy, but the 
allegedly improper behavior of many of his administrative aides also 

brought a degree of shame. The Environmental Protection Agency lost 

several of its most important chiefs, who resigned in disgrace because 

of their mishandling of funds. A presidential aide was convicted of 

perjury, and the secretary of labor was indicted on charges of fraud and 

was obliged to resign, although he was later acquitted. Moreover, the 

attorney general was investigated for  
inﬂ
 uence-peddling; and the sec
-retary of housing and urban development was also investigated for im
-proper behavior in the awarding of housing grants. 
Demo
crats made good use of these scandals to win back control of 
the Senate whereby they defeated the nomination of Robert Bork, a 
highly conservative Reagan appointee, to the Supreme Court. And the 

ever-
mounting deﬁ
cit and trade imbalance, the decline of the real estate 
market, and the resulting damage to savings and loan institutions ap
-
peared to indicate a general nationwide economic collapse. In fact the 

savi
ngs and loan disaster was so extensive that it required federal as
-sistance, to the tune of more than $
500
 billion. There had never been so 
many banks and savings and loan operations go bankrupt since the 

Great Depression. Then, on October 
19, 1987
, the stock market plunged 
508
 points, the largest  one- 
day decline in its history. 
So sure 
were Dem
ocrats of victory in the presidential contest of 
1988 
that a great many candidates threw their hats into the ring. The 
302 
a short history of the united states 
front-
runner, Gary Hart, a former senator from Colorado, was obliged 
to withdraw when newspapers reported alleged sexual misconduct. 
Another candidate, Jesse Jackson, an African-
American civil rights 
leader, also campaigned for the nomination with the support of what 
he called a “rainbow co 
ali
tion” of minorities and the disadvantaged. 
Senator Albert Gore was another contender. But Governor Michael 

Dukakis of Massachusetts won enough primaries to bring him the 

nomination on July 
20 when the Demo
cratic National Convention met 
in Atlanta. He chose Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his running 

mate. 
The Republicans, meeting in New Orleans, chose Vice President 
George Herbert Walker Bush to head their ticket on August 
17, and 
picked Senator J. Danforth Quayle of Indiana to complete the ticket. 

In a particularly nasty but effective negative campaign by the 

Republicans—in which Dukakis was accused of coddling criminals in 

his state and laughed at when shown riding on a tank wearing a 

helmet—Bush wiped out Dukakis’s early lead and went on to win 

48,886
,097
 pop
ular and 
426
 electoral votes from 
40 states, as opposed 
to Dukakis’s 
41,809,074
 pop
ular and 
111 electoral votes from 
10 states. 
But the Democrats continued to control Congress. 
Prior to Reagan’s departure from ofﬁ
ce several notable mea
sures 
were enacted. A tax reform bill exempted a large number of 
low-
income 
Americans from paying federal income taxes, eliminated a number of 

previously allowed deductions and tax shelters, designated capital gains 

as income, reduced the corporate tax rate from 
46 percent to 
34 percent, 
and combined a number of personal income brackets. In addition, the 

Japa
nese-
American Reparations Act of August 
10, 1988
, provided 
$20,000 to each surviving 
Japa
nese-
American who had been interned 
in a relocation camp during World War II. And welfare reform re
-quired states to provide education and training programs for adult 

welfare recipients. 
Bush’s election in 1988
 mar
ked the ﬁ
rst time that a sitting Vice 
President moved to the White  
House, other than by the death or resig
-nation of the President, since Martin Van Buren in the election of 
1836
. In his inaugural address Bush said he would attempt to bring about a 
303 
Violence, Scandal, and the End of the Cold War  
“kinder” and “gentler”America in place of the raucous, violent country 
it had become in the past few years. But in one of his ﬁ
rst actions in 
foreign affairs, he dispatched troops by air to Panama in December 
1989 
to capture its dictator, Manuel Noriega, who had been indicted in the 

United States for drug trafﬁ
cking and money laundering. A demo 
cratic 
government, chosen in free elections, replaced the Noriega regime. 
In his inaugural address Bush also stated that “a new breeze is blow
-ing and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn.” Indeed, the inter
-nal weakness of the Soviet  
Union began to manifest itself in po
liti
cal 
upheavals that erupted throughout eastern Eu
rope. The Solidarity 
Movement in Poland produced a noncommunist government in 
1990
; in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia the populace demanded freedom 

from the Soviet Union; Hungary declared itself a free republic, as did 

Czech 
oslo
vak
ia, Romania, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbai
jan, 
and Armenia. In East Germany thousands of people ﬂ
ed to West Ger
-many through the open borders of Czech
oslo
vakia, Hungary, and Po
-land. People danced on the Berlin Wall and on December 
22, 198
9, the 
Brandenburg Gate was reopened and the wall itself was demolished, 

symbolically ending the Cold War that had been going on for the last 

forty-
ﬁ ve years. 
Communism seemed in full decline. In Russia the policies of glas
-nost and perestroika helped bring about the downfall of Soviet leader 

Mi
khail Gorbachev, who resigned in December 
1991
. Boris Yeltsin took 
over as president of Rus
sia. In Nicaragua free elections took place in 
February 
1990
, driving the Sandinistas from power. Even in Commu
-nist China there  
were in
dications that the country was veering toward 
a more democratic state. Thousands of students demonstrated in the 

streets of Beijing and in Tiananmen Square in the spring of 
1989
, they 
paraded a  
thirty-
foot-
high “Goddess of Freedom” modeled on the 
Statute of Liberty. But the repressive communist leaders of China bru
-tally crushed this rebellion. Tanks and machine guns mowed down 

hu
ndreds of protesters, and many more  
were imprisoned or executed 
after show trials 
were staged. Eastern Eu
rope had been liberated but in 
Asia, and the Middle East, the forces of repression still reigned. 
A new threat to world peace arose on August 
2, 199
0, when the dic
-tator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, seized the border country of Kuwait, 

whi
ch sits on a valuable oil pool. Anxious to protect this nation’s access 
304 a short history of the united states 
to the oil in the Middle East, Bush succeeded in urging the United Na
-tions to take action against Iraq. The UN ordered  
Hu
ssein to withdraw 
his troops and set a deadline for compliance. At the same time, the 
United States rushed troops to Saudi Arabia and Bush worked dili
-gently to create an international co 
ali
tion to check this 
unprovoked 
aggression. Congress authorized the President to employ military force 

to carry out the UN sanctions. By the end of 
1990
 an army of 
500
,000 had been deployed to the area, directed by General Colin Powell, 

chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and executed by General Nor
-man Schwarzkopf, ﬁ
 eld co
mmander of Operation Desert Storm. This 
Gulf War, as it was called, began on January 
16, 1991
, when a military 
attack force crushed the Iraqi army. The war ended quickly with a 

remarkably low number of U.S. casualties—
147
 Americans  
were killed 
in the operation. On February 
25, Saddam agreed to withdraw his 
troops from Kuwait and accepted the terms of a  
cease-
ﬁre. He also ac
-cepted a UN resolution calling for the destruction or removal of all 

Ir
aq’s chemical and biological weapons. The in
de pen
dence of Kuwait 
was reafﬁ
rmed, and Hussein was permitted to remain in power. 
Bush also dispatched troops to Somalia in August 
199
2, to protect 
food supplies being shipped into the country because of a severe famine 

made worse by warfare between competing factions. Then, after the 

killing of eigh
teen U.S. troops in Somalia on October 
3 and 
4, Bush 
ordered 
15,000 additional troops to that country but announced that 
they would be withdrawn in March 
1994
 to allow the UN to ﬁ
nd a po
-liti
cal solution to the problem. 
Because of the failure by Congress to safeguard its constitutional 
ju
risdiction in declaring war, three  
Presidents—Reagan, Bush, and 
later Clinton—took advantage of it by sending troops to Lebanon, 

Grenada, Libya, Kuwait, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, and Yugo
-
slavia  
without any legislative authorization. In taking these actions 
they cited resolutions by the UN or NATO. The War Powers Resolu
-tion was simply ignored. 
The co 
ali
tion Bush had built to drive Hussein from Kuwait decided 
against invading Iraq proper to oust the dictator from power. It was 

judged to be a dicey operation and not worth the risk or the possible 

consequences of such an action. It was a wise decision, one that unfor
-tunately went unheeded a de 
cad
e later. 
11The Conservative Revolution
O ne of the
 ways in which a kinder and gentler country started 
to emerge was the passage, on July 
26, 1990
, of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. This law prohibited discrimination against indi
-viduals with physical or mental disabilities in employment and in the 
use of pub
lic facilities. Bush also appointed Clarence Thomas, an 
African-
American, to the Supreme Court. Thomas replaced Thurgood 
Marshall, the ﬁ
 rst 
African-
American to serve on the high court, who 
had been appointed by President Johnson in 
1967
 and retired in 
1991
. In televised hearings, Thomas faced questions about his alleged sexual 

harassment of Anita Hill, who had worked in his ofﬁ
ce, his ability, and 
his highly conservative views. Nevertheless, the Senate conﬁ
 rmed his 
nomination by a vote of 
52 to 48. The appointment of what seemed like an inferior candidate for the 
Sup
reme Court in order to improve his standing with black and conser
-vative voters, and the grilling of a woman by an 
all-
male committee over 
sexual harassment, damaged Bush’s reputation among many Ameri
-cans. Even worse, the economy throughou
t his ad
ministration appeared 
to be in a worrisome decline. Unemployment escalated, approaching ten 

percent in some states, and the deﬁ
cit kept getting worse. In an effort 

to control the deﬁ
cit, Bush made one of his most serious mistakes 
when he agreed, in 
1990
, to a bud
get deal with the Democrats to raise 
$134
 billion in new taxes over ﬁ
ve years. This was a reversal of a prom
-ise he made before his election that he would not raise taxes: “Read my 

li
ps, no new taxes,” he had said. His subsequent action horriﬁ
 ed his 
306 a short history of the united states 
conservative base. It was such a ﬂ
ag
rant disregard of a campaign prom
-ise that it cost him dearly when he stood for reelection. 
Bush’s success in building a co
ali
tion that drove Saddam Hussein 
from Kuwait was the high point of his administration. Unquestionably, 
this successful war discouraged many of the leading Democratic candi
-dates from challenging his bid for a second term. But a relative unknown, 

Go
vernor William Jefferson Clinton of Arkansas, decided to go for it; 
and after a series of 
hard-
fought primaries in which his sexual affairs and 
draft evasion received widespread attention, he managed to win the 

nomination at the convention held in New York from July 
13 to 16, 1992
. He chose Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee to run with him. 
Bush and Quayle again headed the Republican ticket, chosen in Hous
-ton on August 
20; bu
t they ran a dispirited race against an opponent 
whose several bus trips around the country displayed an energy and 

youthfulness that offered the electorate a sharp and favorable contrast 

in style and manner. But the faltering economy more than anything 

else played the decisive role in this election. At Clinton’s headquarters 

a brief but effective sign emphasized this issue. It read, “It’s the econ
-omy, stupid.” 
Concern over the economy produced a third candidate, H. Ross 
Pe
rot, a Texan billionaire. He was particularly concerned about the size 
of the federal bud
get. At one point he withdrew from the campaign but 
then turned around and reentered it. The three men held three tele
-vised  
debates—a practice that had begun with Kennedy and Nixon in 
1960
—and in one of them Bush was seen looking at his watch, obvi
-ously concerned about ending what was to him an endurance contest. 

Pe
rot did well in the debates, boasting that he had never held public 
ofﬁ
ce and that he could not be blamed for running up a huge govern
-ment deﬁ
 cit. 
The ﬁ
nal result came as a surprise to Bush.  He, a family man and a 
wartime 
hero, had been defeated by a womanizer and draft dodger. It 
was a shock. And this election attracted 
55 percent of the voting popu
-lation, the largest in over twenty years. Clinton garnered 
44,908,254 
popular and 
370 electoral votes to Bush’s 
39,102,343
 pop
ular and 
168 
electoral votes. Perot received no electoral votes, but he did attract 

19,741
,065
 pop
ular votes. Not since Theodore Roo se
velt’s Bull Moose 
candidacy in 
1912
 had a third-
party candidate done as well as Perot. 
307 
The Conservative Revolution 
Clinton’s 
370 electoral votes came from 
32 states; Bush’s 
168
 came from 
18 states. 
And Congress continued under Demo
cr
atic control. Not only was 
Bush dismissed from ofﬁ
ce, but a great many Congressmen as well. 
The largest number of turnovers in the  
House of Representatives in 
forty years occurred.  Forty-
four members of the lower chamber  
were defeated in primaries or the general election, and over 
100
 new mem
-bers 
were elect
ed. These new members included 
39 African-
Americans, 
19 Hispanic-
Americans, 
7 Asian-
Americans, 
1 Native American, and 
48 women. Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois was elected to the Senate, 
the ﬁ
 rst 
African-
American female to achieve that honor. She and 
5 other women now comprised the entire female repre
senta
tion in the 
upper  
house. The number of women in the lower chamber  
rose from 
28 to 48. The reason for this massive turnover was most probably due, in large 
par
t, to a scandal in which it was revealed in early 
1991
 that 
325 sitting 
and former members of the  
House overdrew their accounts in the 
House Bank and paid no penalty. The  
House Bank was a kind of 
checking ser
vice in which members deposited their salaries and drew 
against them. When overdrafts occurred, they 
were covered from the 
general pool and the individuals  
were not charged for issuing bad 
checks. 
Republicans demanded an investigation by the  
Hou
se Ethics Com
-mittee, but Demo
cr
ats countered that no federal money was involved 
and no crime had been committed. James Nussle of Iowa appeared on 

the ﬂ
oor of the  
House with a paper bag over his head and demanded to 
know who had issued the overdrafts. The partisan rancor that resulted 

only further poisoned the atmosphere in Congress, and the turnout at 

the election reﬂ
 ected pop
ular disgust with the antics of the members. 
One happy result was the creation, in 
1992
, of a  
house administrator to 
oversee ﬁ
nancial (mostly payrolls) and other nonlegislative matters 
such as internal mail. The  House Bank was also abolished. 
Not surprisingly, the  
Twenty-
Seventh Amendment to the Constitu
-tion was ratiﬁ
 ed in 
1992
. This amendment prohibited Congress from 
increasing the salary of its members until a new election had taken 
place and a new Congress had been sworn in. James Madison had ﬁ
 rst proposed this amendment when he submitted his Bill of Rights in 
308 a short history of the united states 
1789
, but it was one of two amendments proposed that was not ratiﬁ
 ed when t
he ﬁ
rst ten amendments 
were adopted. 
As President, Clinton 
got o
ff to a bad start, foolishly assum
-ing that the electorate wanted a program of liberal reform. On taking 
ofﬁ
ce he announced his opposition to the ban on gay and lesbian per
-sonnel in the armed services. A ﬁ
rest
orm of protest resulted, and he 
was forced to accept a policy of “Don’t ask, don’t tell,” namely that gays 

and lesbians could enter the military if they remained quiet about their 

sexual preferences. 
Clinton followed that mistake with a major blunder. He appointed 
hi
s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to head a task force to plan a com
-prehensive  
hea
lth-
care system for the country. That plan was an
-nounced by the President in a nationally televised speech before a joint 

se
ssion of Congress. It proved to be unbelievably complicated. The bill 
itself ran to over thirteen hundred pages and was assigned to three 

committees of the  
House. Not one of these committees could come up 
with an acceptable measure, while Republicans took plea
sure in con
-demning this needlessly complex plan. By the end of the year the 

hea
lth-
care bill was beyond resuscitation, and declared dead. 
President Clinton had better luck in persuading Congress to enact 
th
e Brady Bill, a gun control law, named for James Brady, an aide who 
had been severely wounded in the attempted assassination of President 

Reagan in 
1981
. This mea
sure imposed a  
ﬁ ve- day waiting period for 
handgun purchases and was later augmented to prevent the sale of 

guns to convicted felons. And in July 
1994
 Congress passed an anti
-crime bill that outlawed several kinds of assault weapons. 
These anticrime mea
sure
s reﬂected the genuine concern of many 
Americans about the level of violence that had enveloped the country 

over the past de 
cade, a level that matched that of the 
1960
s. In 1993
 a radical Muslim group bombed the World Trade Center in New York 

City, killing half a dozen people and wounding many others. That 

same year in Waco, Texas, a fundamentalist religious group known as 

the Branch Davidians held off federal ofﬁ
cers from searching their 
compound in a gun battle that resulted in the deaths of many of the 

residents. Presumably in retribution for this killing, a terrorist attack in 
309 
The Conservative Revolution 
1995
 destroyed the federal ofﬁ
ce building in Oklahoma City, and 
169 
men, women, and children lost their lives. That such an outrage by 
American citizens could take place in this country seemed unbeliev
-able. But it clearly demonstrated that there  
were an
gry, armed individ
-uals who felt contempt toward the government and did not hesitate to 

ta
ke the law into their own hands. The perpetrators of this tragedy 
were apprehended, tried, and punished. 
Violence and corruption. They dominated the news during the 
199
0s. The  
health-
care ﬁ
asco provided Republicans with additional 
arguments about how the government had been corrupted by contin
-ued Demo
cratic control over the past forty years. There  were additional 
scandals, too. One of them forced the resignation of Robert Packwood 
from the Senate when several women charged him with sexual harass
-ment. Another involved the Congressional Post Ofﬁ
ce in
 which a grand 
jury found evidence that funds had been embezzled and stamps pro
-vided to members had been exchanged for cash. 
These scandals increased public anger over the behavior of their 
fe
deral ofﬁ
cials, and Newt Gingrich, a  
House leader of Republicans, 
kept reminding the electorate that it was time for a change. Forty years 

of uninterrupted Demo
cratic control of the  
House proved it. He re
-cruited young, energetic Republicans to run for ofﬁ
ce, ra
ised money to 
help them in their campaigns, and sent them training tapes to educate 

them further in the ways of winning ofﬁ
ce. On September 
27, 1994
, some 
300
 Republican congressional incumbents and challengers to 
Demo
cratic incumbents gathered on the steps of the Capitol and un
-veiled Gingrich’s “Contract with America,” by which they promised to 

cl
eanse the  
House of its corruption in the ﬁ
 rst 
100
 days of the next 
Congress if the public elected at least forty new Republicans. 
And change did  come—with devastating force. In the midterm 
elec
tion of 
1994
 the Demo
crats hardly knew what hit them. They lost 
52 seats in the  
House of Representatives, whereas not a single incum
-bent Republican failed to win reelection. Even the Demo
cra
tic Speaker, 
Thomas Foley, lost his election. The Republicans captured control of 

the  
House, 
230
 to 204
, and a conservative revolution began in earnest. 
Foley was the ﬁ
rst si
tting Speaker to lose since 
1862
, when Galusha A. 
Grow of Pennsylvania was defeated. Newt Gingrich was credited with 

this unexpected triumph and was elected the new Speaker. Republicans 
310 
a short history of the united states 
now ruled the lower chamber after forty years in the wilderness, and 
th
ey also won control of the Senate, 
53 to 47, which they had not done 
since 
1986
. Furthermore, they picked up a dozen new governorships. 
Most of the items listed in the “Contract with America” 
were passed 
in the  
House of Representatives, except the one calling for a constitu
-tional amendment to limit members’ terms to twelve years, and a mis
-sile defense system in space. But few got past the Senate. Gingrich was 

pa
rticularly anxious to obtain a balanced bud
get. He would have pre
-ferred a constitutional amendment, but failing that objective he warned 

th
e administration that a balance between income and expenditures had 
to be reached by 
2002
. The  
House Bud 
get Committee reported out a 
bill that trimmed $
1 trillion in spending cuts over the next seven years. 
Hundreds of programs and several cabinet departments (Education 

and Commerce and Energy) 
were eliminated in this proposal. Leon 
Panetta, a California Demo
crat, accused Gingrich of attempting to 
hold a gun to President Clinton’s head by threatening to “shut down 

the government” if the Republicans “did not get their tax cuts to help 

the rich and cut spending that would help the young, the old, the poor 

and the needy.” Clinton encouraged Demo
crats in the  
House to lam
-baste the Republicans for their efforts to slash the bud
get that helped 
those dependent on the government’s social programs. And whereas the 

GOP appeared rigid and unreasonable about ﬁ
scal matters, the Presi
-dent seemed more open to compromise as he slowly nudged his party 

away f
rom its extreme liberalism to a more moderate centrist position. 
He even agreed to a welfare reform bill that, among other things, cut 

welfare grants and required 
able-
bodied welfare recipients to ﬁ
 nd work. 
Later Clinton would say that “the era of big government is over.” 
When Clinton vetoed a stopgap spending bill, funding for most 
gover
nment ofﬁ
ces ran out on November 
13, 1995
. As a result almost 
800
,000 federal employees  
were ordered home. Vital ser
vices like law 
enforcement remained operative, but a wide range of government 

operations—from tourist attractions like the National Gallery of Art 

in Washington and the Yosemite, Yellowstone, Smoky Mountains, and 

Grand Canyon national parks to the pro 
cessing of Social Security 
applications—were shut down. If, said Gingrich, the only way we 

could demonstrate “that we  
were really going to balance the bud
get” 
was by closing the government, then so be it. Otherwise, “you never 
311 
The Conservative Revolution 
would have gotten Clinton and his staff to realize how deadly serious 
we were.” 
The public reacted to the shutdown with anger and disbelief. It was 
pr
obably more the idea of a government shutdown to prove a point 
than the closing of tourist sites that offended them. What kind of gov
-ernment is this? asked many outraged citizens. A banana republic? 
Then Speaker Gingrich made a colossal mistake. At a breakfast 
me
eting with reporters he revealed that he had imposed the shutdown 
in part because he and other Republicans had been snubbed by Clinton 

on an overseas diplomatic trip to attend the funeral of the assassinated 

prime minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, by making him and the Senate 

majority leader Robert Dole exit the plane from the rear door. 
The reporters guffawed. Newspapers around the country high
-lighted the story. On November 
16, 199
5, a cartoon appeared on the 
front page of the New York 
Daily News
 showing Gingrich as a scream
-ing baby in a diaper under a boldface headline: “CRY BABY.” The 

ca
ption read: “Newt’s Tantrum. He closed down the government be
-cause Clinton made him sit at the back of the plane.” Suddenly Ging
-rich had become the villain of the shutdown drama. 
After a weekend of talks between the opposing sides a truce was an
-nounced on Sunday eve 
ni
ng, November 
19, sending federal employees 
back to work on Monday. A continuing resolution was passed to cover 

government expenses through December 
15, as the  
House leadership 
labored for the next four weeks to reach a bud
get deal with the White 
House. But disagreements and recriminations brought the negotiations 

to a halt, and at midnight on December 
15, the government shut down 
again—just in time for Christmas. This time the shutdown lasted 

twenty-
one days. 
With 
250,000 federal employees locked out, Congress adjourned for 
the Christmas holiday and members went home to face very angry con
-stituencies. By the time they returned to Washington in January, they 

kn
ew that the 
so-called Republican revolution was in trouble. “Enough 
is enough,” cried Senator Robert Dole. Even Gingrich capitulated. 

He told the Republicans assembled in the  
House on January 
5, 1996
, that it was time to end the shutdown. Later that day both the  
House 
and Senate passed a series of appropriation bills that reopened the 

government and terminated the battle between Congress and the 
312 
a short history of the united states 
White  
House, a battle Clinton had clearly won. But many conserva
-tives did not forgive Gingrich for failing to stand his ground and for 
no
t refusing to concede. 
With a booming economy, falling deﬁ
ci
ts, and his wise move toward 
a more centrist po
liti
cal position, Clinton was reelected to a second 
term in 
1996
 over Senator Dole, a wounded veteran of World War II 
who ran a lackluster campaign. Ross Perot was nominated by a much 
shriveled Reform Party and mustered only half the support he had 

enjoyed four years earlier. Clinton polled 
45,628
,667
 pop
ular and 
379 electoral votes to Dole’s 
37,869
,435
 pop
ular and 
159 electoral votes. 
Almost all the electoral votes for Dole came from the South and 

mountain states of the West. 
In foreign affairs, Clinton showed an unsteady hand. Like his pre
-deces sor, he both dispatched troops to Somalia as part of a peacekeep
-ing operation, and then abruptly withdrew them when a dozen or more 
Ame
rican soldiers 
were killed. He did help broker an agreement be
-tween the Israelis and Palestinians to allow Palestinian  
self
-rule in the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank, but these efforts failed to achieve peace 

when extremists on both sides kept up their shooting and killing on a 

regular basis. 
When 
communist- 
controlled Yugo 
slavia split into ﬁ
 ve in
de pen
dent 
nations, Bosnia, one of the ﬁve, and ethnically and culturally divided 

between Christian and Muslim, erupted in a bloody civil war. Pursu
-ing a program called “ethnic cleansing,” the Christian faction in Bosnia 

mas
sacred or deported Muslims. To help bring an end to this 
blood
letting and stop the ﬁ
ghting, Clinton committed U.S. troops to a 
NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia in 
1995
. What remained of Yugo slavia sought to put down a rebellion of eth
-nic Albanians in Kosovo who  
wer
e seeking in
de pen
dence. Slobodan 
Milosevic, the president of Yugo slavia, responded with brutal force, 

whereupon in 
1999
 an expanded NATO that now included Poland, 
Hungary, and Czech 
oslo
vak
ia, began a massive bombing campaign 
against Yugo
slavia’s military bases and brought the ﬁ
ghting to an end. 
Milosevic was later tried by an international tribunal for his crimes, but 

he died in prison before the ﬁ
nal verdict could be rendered by the court. 
Clinton did display a degree of determination and courage in foreign 
af
fairs when he threw his support behind a North American Free 
313 
The Conservative Revolution 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in November, 
1993
, which set up a free 
trade zone or common market consisting of Canada, Mexico, and the 
United States. Despite congressional objections, he also provided bil
-lions of dollars in aid to Mexico to help its troubled economy. Many 

la
bor  
unions objected to NAFTA for fear of losing jobs to the poorer 
paid workers in Mexico. 
The latter h a lf 
of
 the twentieth century witnessed additional 
and profound changes in American life and activity. Because of wars 
and the attraction of cheap labor in the southern and western states of 

the nation, a shift in population to those areas resulted, creating what 

was called the Sun Belt. A great number of people along with a good 

deal of economic activity moved southward from what was called the 

Rust Belt of the North and thereby shifted the balance of po
liti
cal and 
economic power away from the Northeast, where it had been lodged 

for de 
cades. For the most part these migrants  
were conservative in 
their po
liti
cal views, and they helped establish a Republican majority in 
many of these states. 
They also tended to join Evangelical churches, which emphasized 
the importance of a personal encounter with the Almighty as a means 
of salvation. By the end of the century, Evangelical church membership 

outnumbered the more traditional Protestant denominations. And they 

increasingly played a pivotal role in politics, both on the national and 

state levels. The Roman Catholic church in the United States also 

changed because of the recommendations of the Second Vatican Coun
-cil in 
1965
 in which ser
vices 
were conducted in En
glish rather than Latin, 
and communicants  
were urged to follow their own properly formed 
consciences in conducting their lives. But the church faced a serious 

scandal when it was revealed that a great number of priests had sexu
-ally abused young boys and that bishops had participated in an extensive 

cover
-up when informed of these crimes by moving the accused priests 
to different perishes. Many dioceses 
were later sued and ordered to pay 
millions of dollars in damages, necessitating a few dioceses to seek 

protection in bankruptcy courts. 
Much of this new direction in American life may have been the re
-sult of the  
so-called sexual liberation of the 
1970
s, when the young in 
314 
a short history of the united states 
society engaged in more frequent sexual activities. These encounters 
beca
me so prevalent that they produced a large number of teenage 
pregnancies and many 
one-
parent families. Among homosexuals a 
dreadful epidemic broke out in the 
1980
s, when a virus known as ac
-quired immune deﬁ
ciency syndrome, or AIDS, caused the deaths of 

coun
tless individuals, many of whom contracted the infection by in
-jecting themselves with illegal drugs. 
In 1979
 the Reverend Jerry Falwell, pastor of a Baptist church in Vir
-ginia, had founded an or
ganizati
on he called the Moral Majority, a 
conservative religious group that became politi
cally active. Among other 
things, it lobbied Congress and party leaders to enact legislation that 

would halt the “immoral behavior” which was “corrupting the nation” 

and would restore “traditional family values” and the “free enterprise 

system” which had been the bedrock of American life for the past 
200 
years. This extreme  
right-
wing movement proved to have enormous po
-liti
cal power in local and national elections and increasingly edged the 
Republican party toward a greater commitment to religious values. 
Other important changes to American society included the fact that 
me
n and women lived longer than previous generations, thanks in 
large part to the advances in medical science, such as the discovery of 

drugs to cure or prevent numerous diseases. In the last half of the 

twentieth century the number of Americans who lived to retirement 

age doubled. Many lived into their seventies and eighties, and by the 

twenty-
ﬁ rst century it was not uncommon for men and women to live 
to be 
100
. This caused a surprising turnaround in the early  twenty-
ﬁ rst 
century. More people left the South than arrived in the Sun Belt. Cen
-sus reports showed that from 
2000 to 2005
, approximately 
120,000 people left and only 
87,000 arrived in the South. A de 
cade earlier, 
something like 
57,000 had left and 
92,000 had arrived. Evidently men 
and women who reached their seventies or eighties, especially if their 

spouses had died, moved back north to be with their children and 

grandchildren. Still, of the ten cities in the country with the highest 

number of residents by the middle of 
2007, four of them were located in 
the south: Houston with 
2,144,491,
 Phoenix with 
1,512,986,
 San Anto
-nio with 
1,296,682,
 and Dallas with 
1,232,940
. Only New York, Los 
Angeles, and Chicago had higher numbers of populations. 
The decision of the Supreme Court in 
Roe
 v. Wade
 allowed women 
315 
The Conservative Revolution 
to undergo abortions legally, and this right became a rallying cry in the 
women’s liberation movement, which really picked up steam in the 

1980
s. There had been a women’s rights movement as early as the Jack
-sonian era, if not earlier, and with slow progress many notable achieve
-ments had been won after a long, hard ﬁ
gh
t. But the movement now 
went beyond such matters as women’s suffrage and legal recognition of 

their rights as citizens. Women wanted equality with men in employ
-ment, in educational, cultural, and athletic activities, and in many 

ot
her areas of activity and opportunity. In March 
1972
, Congress passed 
and sent to the states for ratiﬁ
cation an equal rights amendment (ERA) 
to the Constitution which said that the “equality of rights” shall not be 

denied or abridged on the basis of sex. In the  
House of Representatives, 
Martha Grifﬁ
ths, a Demo
crat from Michigan, led the ﬁ
ght for the 
amendment and insisted that women  
were discriminated against in 
employment, property rights, divorce proceedings, pensions, and inheri
-tance. Although some twenty states ratiﬁ
ed th
e ERA in the early months, 
an opposing and more conservative group protested against it, insisting 

that traditional family values would be undermined if the amendment 

was ratiﬁ
ed. And that ended the ERA. The amendment went down to 
defeat when the time limit for ratiﬁ
cation expired in 
1982
. But women did make headway in many ﬁ
eld
s, not just as nurses, 
secretaries, clerks, and grade school teachers. They broke through the 

glass ceiling, as it was called, and became business executives, police 

ofﬁ
cers, lawyers, governors of states, members of Congress, and leaders 
in many other important ﬁ
elds of endeavor. In 
2007, Nancy Pelosi, a 
Demo
crat from California, was elected Speaker of the  
House of Rep
-resentatives, the ﬁ
rst f
emale Speaker in the history of the  
House. As 
such she became one of the most powerful politicians in the country, 

after the President. By her election she had crashed through a “marble 

ceiling,” as she labeled it. 
Of monumental importance in changing the way Americans con
-ducted their lives was the introduction of the personal computer by 

Int
ernational Business Machines (IBM) in the 
1960
s. Computers of 
gargantuan size had been in use de 
cades earlier, but the invention of 
the microchip in 
1971
 made it possible to create, ﬁ
 nd, or
ganize, and 
store information on much smaller machines operated in the home and 

in businesses. Data and word pro
cessing became possible when the 
316 
a short history of the united states 
Microsoft Company, headed by Bill Gates, provided the necessary pro
-gramming software. Suddenly, an electronic industry emerged, espe
-cially in a part of California between San Jose and San Francisco, 

kn
own as Silicon Valley, which supplied the country with the hardware 
that opened up a new world of communicating. The speed and capacity 

of microchips improved almost every other month, so that computers 

became more portable and essential in conducting one’s business and 

private affairs. In time computers became so vital to business, govern
-ment, and individual activity that any breakdown of the computer sys
-tem could paralyze the normal functions of daily life. 
The Internet made it possible to access information in a matter of 
mi
nutes, both at home and at work. Instant communication between 
individuals and between companies was provided via e-mail. And the 

World Wide Web, created in 
1991
, made it possible to access informa
-tion on every imaginable subject or activity with just a few clicks on the 

mo
use on the computer. Web sites grew in number and importance 
each year. The nation entered an Information Age that demanded 

high-
speed transmission among and between individuals and corpora
-tions. Personal computers became an essential part of everyday life. 

Th
is technological age both created new jobs and destroyed old ones. 
Computers frequently took the place of the  
go-between, that is, those 
who play the role of an intermediary between a client and a product. 
The invention of wireless telephones or cell phones and BlackBerrys 
added to t
he speed with which Americans could communicate with 
one another. The United States became a nation that supplied services 

of many kinds as well as a producer of physical products that could be 

packaged and sold around the world. And the invention of the transis
-tor in 
1947
 ushered i
n the digital age. 
The scientiﬁ
c adva
nces in the last half of the twentieth century 
were spectacular not only in producing improved machines and the ways of 

operating them, but in such ﬁ
elds as medicine, biology, and chemistry. 
The secrets of the molecular structure of humans  were unlocked in the 

1950
s, by which it became possible to clone living animals. Organ 
transplants, including heart transplants, proved possible.  
Stem-cell re
-search offered the possibility of curing hereditary and  life-
thre
atening 
diseases, but this research raised moral and ethical questions that were 

not easily answered. 
317 The Conservative Revolution 
Of par
tic 
ular concern to an older generation was the fact that the 
family in which children  
were raised by two parents of the opposite 
sex, one of whom (usually the male) worked and the other (usually the 
female) stayed home and raised the children, was disintegrating at an 

alarming rate. Marriage was often put off until the male had reached 

his  
mid-
thirties and the female her late twenties. Worse, divorce be
-came commonplace. Every other marriage seemed to end in divorce, 

whi
ch was easier to obtain than had been the case a generation earlier. 
More and more children  
were born to single mothers. Indeed, every 
fourth child arrived in a home in which the father was missing. Too 

often such a family lived at or near the poverty level. The resulting 

emotional and psychological scars resulting from this situation were 

and remain incalculable. Crime rates among the young increased sub
-stantially, most especially in urban areas. 
Another concern was the growing number of Latinos coming into 
this country. Thousands illegally crossed the Mexican border into the 
United States, where they accepted  
low-
paying farmwork. Not all 
were Mexicans. Many came from other Latin American countries and 

poured across the Mexican–U.S. border in their search for a better 

life. They settled, for the most part, in the Southwest, from Texas to 

California. By the beginning of the  
twenty-
ﬁrst century Latinos con
-stituted over a third of the populations in California, Arizona, and 

Te
xas, and nearly half the population in New Mexico. In the East 
there was a steady stream of Puerto Ricans into the continental United 

States, and Cuban refugees settled in Miami and surrounding com
-munities, making En
glish a seco
nd language in this area. As a matter 
of fact, many cities to the north followed a general trend in making 

signs, directions, and information available in both En
glish and Span
-ish. A great deal of 
anti
-immigration sentiment was generated, espe
-cially since so many of these immigrants were in the United States 

il
legally. Congress attempted to deal with the problem by passing the 
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 
1986
, which penalized em
-ployers of illegal immigrants and granted amnesty to those immi
-grants who had already arrived. But the problem kept getting worse 

beca
use the border with Mexico was not adequately policed. Building 
fences was impractical along a 
1,000-mile line (to say nothing of the 
cost), and as one Mexican consul in Chicago stated, “For every foot of 
318 
a short history of the united states 
fence built above the ground an equal amount would have to be con
-structed under it.” 
Immigration from Asia also gained momentum in the 
1980
s, and 
Asians became not only a  
fast-
growing minority but a prosperous one as 
well. No longer satisﬁ
ed with menial employment, they sought and 
achieved better jobs through their reliance on education. Asian children 
in school 
were among the brightest and most dedicated. As graduates 
they entered the ﬁ
elds of science, medicine, business, and industry. 
The fact that the population of the United States in the census of 
2000
 reached nearly 
300 
million and that it had grown by more than 
30 million over the past ten years said something that was very signiﬁ
 -cant, in that the 
30 mi
llion represented the largest population increase 
for a  
ten-
year period in the history of the United States. 
Since the beginning 
of h
is administration, Clinton had endured 
any number of investigations by Republicans into the operations of the 

White  
House, including the travel ofﬁ
ce and the involvement of the 
Clintons in the Whitewater land scheme in Arkansas. The obvious 

purpose of these investigations was to ﬁ
 nd sufﬁ
cient cause to initiate 
impeachment proceedings. Clinton’s sexual activities also came in for a 

renewal of charges that began when he was governor of Arkansas. In 

par
tic 
ular, Paula Jones, a former employee, claimed that she had suf
-fered sexual harassment. Worse, he was accused of inappropriate be
-havior toward a White  
House intern, Monica Lewinsky, that had 
allegedly occurred in the Oval Ofﬁ
ce, no less. The Attorney General, 
Janet Reno, appointed Kenneth Starr to investigate the allegations, and 

in testimony before a grand jury in January 
1998
, the President swore 
he had had no improper relations with Lewinsky, a denial he repeated 

several more times to members of Congress, his cabinet, and others. 
Nevertheless, the truth ﬁ
nal
ly emerged. Continued revelations of in
-criminating evidence eventually forced Clinton to admit before a tele
vi-sion audience on August 
15, 1998
, that he had indeed carried on an 
“inappropriate” affair with Lewinsky. But he went on to insist that he 

had done nothing illegal. Certainly nothing impeachable. And a good 

many people believed him. “I think the American people,” declared Re
-publican Senator Robert E. Bennett of Utah, “have come to the conclu
-319 
The Conservative Revolution 
sion that they do not want to drive the president out of ofﬁ
ce just because 
he’s not faithful to his wife, and they turned off all the rest of it.” 
Kenneth Starr submitted his evidence of Clinton’s improper behav
-ior to Congress in 
thirt
y-
six boxes of documents in September, shortly 
after it had returned from recess. Starr declared that the President’s ac
-tions may indeed “constitute grounds for impeachment.” After all, he 
had li
ed to a grand jury under oath. A good bit of this evidence was 
placed on the Internet at the direction of Newt Gingrich, and, said 

Bob Livingston, a Republican leader in the  
House of Representatives, 
“I’m convinced, with the wisdom of the American people that they 

sensed a degree of unfairness there. Public attitude switched from be
-ing totally against Clinton to against the Republicans.” On October 
8, 1998
, the  
House adopted a resolution, 
258
 to 176
, instructing the Judi
-ciary Committee, chaired by Henry Hyde of Illinois, to examine the 

ev
idence and decide whether the president had committed impeach
-able offenses “or whether it was just something personal and not a mat
-ter of national concern.” 
Hearings by the  
thirt
y-
seven-
member committee  
were quite heated, 
and as far as the Republicans  
were concerned, insisted Henry Hyde, 
the charges “had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with 

perjury and swearing under oath.” But the Demo
crats on the commit
-tee and in Congress “were successful in deﬁ
ni
ng the issue as a very 
personal one that lying about is not uncommon,” that sexual misbehav
-ior was not a high crime or misdemeanor. They further warned the 

Re
publicans of a backlash. “As you judge the president of the United 
States,” cautioned Representative Charles Rangel of New York, “the 

voters will be judging you on November 
3rd.” 
And indeed the electorate demonstrated its dis 
ple
asure by reducing 
the number of Republicans in the  
House by ﬁ
 ve members. “Instead of 
gaining seats” as they expected, said Livingston, who served as chair
-man of the Appropriations Committee, “we lost ﬁ
ve. I wa
s furious. 
That’s because I’d worked my butt off all year to campaign and raised a 

ton of money. And they 
were all turned into 
anti-
Clinton ads and that’s 
not what I’d raised them for. I said that I’d raised the money to spend 

on pro-
Republican ads. We didn’t talk about what we had done right. 
We talked about what he [Clinton] had done wrong. And we blew it.” 
Livingston then decided to challenge Gingrich for the speakership, 
320 a short history of the united states 
but Gingrich, knowing he was sure to lose (there had been a previous 
fa
iled effort to unseat him as Speaker) resigned both his seat and as 
Speaker. The Republicans then chose Livingston as 
Speaker- 
designate. 
The irony is that both Gingrich and Livingston were involved in adul
-terous affairs themselves, as they later admitted. 
At the urging of the leadership, the Judiciary Committee agreed on 
Decem
ber 
11–12 that Clinton had in fact “committed perjury and ob
-structed justice.” Furthermore, the committee declared that “it would 

be a dereli
ction of duty if we didn’t proceed . . . with impeachment 
with a view towards removing him from ofﬁ
ce.” The vote was 
21 to 16 for impeachment, but the committee members realized that a success
-ful prosecution of their charges would be a long shot at best, since re
-moval by the Senate required a  
two
-thirds vote. 
The committee presented its report to the full House of Representa
-tives, and for thirteen and a half hours over two days, December 
18 and 
19, the members heatedly debated the merits of the ﬁ
 ndings. The 
Demo
crats insisted that censure was the appropriate action to take, but 
on a procedural vote that suggestion was defeated. Then, it was re
-vealed that the 
Speaker
- designate, Bob Livingston, had also commit
-ted adultery, whereupon he announced his resignation. In his place the 

De
puty Whip, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, was elected Speaker by the 
full House on January 
6, 1999
, thanks in large part to the efforts of the 
Republican Whip, Tom DeLay of Texas. 
The  
House then proceeded to vote on the impeachment issue, but 
the outcome was predictable, given the size of the Republican majority. 
The vote was 
228
 to 206 on the perjury charge and 
221 to 212
 on the 
obstruction of justice charge. A  
thirteen-
member committee, chaired 
by Henry Hyde, was approved to serve as managers of the impeach
-ment trial in the Senate. To their surprise and dismay, these members 

fo
und the Senate unsympathetic to their efforts. We were “the prover
-bial skunk at the garden party,” declared Hyde. “Nobody wanted us. 

Th
e senators wanted to get it over with in a hurry and following the 
polls and ﬁ
nding that this impeachment was not the most pop 
ular 
move in the world,” they wanted to get rid of it as quickly as possible. 

“There was nobody really enthusiastic for what we  were doing, includ
-ing our own [Senate Republican] leadership.” 
The trial in the Senate began on January 
7, 1999
, with Chief Justice 
321 The Conservative Revolution 
William Rehnquist presiding. To begin the proceedings, Hyde re
-minded the senators of their duty as impartial jurors. Other members 
of t
he prosecuting committee argued that Clinton had lied under oath 
to a federal judge, had disgraced his ofﬁ
ce, and deserved punishment 
like any other citizen. The defense was a  
high- 
powered group of eight 
lawyers, headed by Charles Ruff, the White  House counsel. Ruff in
-sisted that the vision of the managers was far too dark. “I believe it to 

be a v
ision more focused on retribution,” he said, “more designed to 
achieve partisan ends.” The vision of the defense is far different, he 

continued. “We know the pain the president has caused our society and 

his family and his friends, but we know, too, how much the president 

has done for this country.” 
Any comparison of the pre
sen
tations by the prosecution and defense 
left little doubt that the  House prosecutors failed to convince the sena
-tors to vote to remove Clinton from ofﬁ
ce. To
 the public at large it ap
-peared to be a matter of partisan hatred for a morally ﬂ
 awed Pre
sident 
and a desire to exact retribution. On February 
9, 1999
, after nearly ﬁ
 ve weeks of testimony and deliberation, the senators voted against re
-moval and acquitted Clinton. Ten Republicans and all  
fort
y-ﬁ ve Demo
-crats voted not guilty to the charge of perjury; ﬁ
 ft
y senators voted not 
guilty to the charge of obstruction of justice, but another ﬁ
 fty voted 
guilty. Later Clinton expressed his “profound” regret for what he had 

imposed on Congress and the American people. 
The intense bitterness and partisanship of the scandal and trial car
-ried over into the presidential election of 
2000
. The Demo
crats nomi
-nated Al Gore of Tennessee, the sitting Vice President, to head their 

ti
cket, along with Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the ﬁ
 rst 
Jewish vice presidential candidate. The Republicans chose Governor 

George W. Bush of Texas, son of the former President; and Richard 

Cheney of Wyoming, who had been Secretary of Defense under Presi
-dent George H. W. Bush. A third party, the Green Party, emerged and 

put f
orward the consumer advocate Ralph Nader for the top position. 
In the campaign Bush presented himself as an outsider who would 
rest
ore “honor and dignity” to the White  
House after Clinton had sul
-lied it. He insisted that he was a “uniter,” not a “divider,” a “compas
-sionate conservative.” Gore made the mistake of distancing himself 

fr
om Clinton and thereby losing the ability to claim credit for the 
322 
a short history of the united states 
administration—of which he had been an important  
par
t— 
for the 
prosperous years in which surpluses in running the government helped 
reduce the national debt. Even so, he won a majority of the pop ular 

vote, garnering several hundred thousand more votes than Bush. But 

the electoral vote was so close that a battle resulted over the Florida 

returns. It seems that voting irregularities and malfunctioning voting 

machines produced  
punch-
card ballots that occasionally carried what 
was called a “hanging chad,” which confused both machine and human 

counters. Gore supporters demanded a recount in selected counties 

where the outcome was in dispute. But the Republican secretary of 

state halted the recount and declared Bush the winner of Florida’s 

votes. Gore’s lawyers asked the Florida supreme court for a ruling, and 

this court ordered the recount to resume. Whereupon the Bush lawyers 

appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled, by a partisan vote of 

5 to 4 on December 
12, that the recount be halted. With Florida now in 
the Bush column he had 
271
 electoral votes to 
267
 for Gore. It is also 
likely that the candidacy of Ralph Nader drew many votes away from 

Gore, votes that might have reversed the ﬁnal result and put the Vice 

President in the White  
House. Nationwide, Nader polled two and a 
half million votes. In Florida he captured over 
95,000 votes, just enough 
to throw the state to Bush. 
Because of his 
own several disappointments in business and lim
-ited experience in government, Bush chose Dick Cheney as his running 
mate, a staunch conservative who enjoyed a successful career as a mem
-ber of the  
Ho
use of Representatives and had joined the Republican 
leadership team in the lower chamber where he was elected minority 

whip. He might have gone on to win the ofﬁ
ce of Speaker had he not 
accepted the post of secretary of defense in the ﬁ
rst Bush administra
-tion. No doubt with the younger Bush’s encouragement, Cheney soon 

beca
me a potent force within the new administration in deciding na
-tional policy. One of the most inﬂ
 uent
ial Vice Presidents in American 
history, he exercised almost as much power in foreign and domestic af
-fairs as did the President. Together, these two men helped solidify ex
-ecutive authority and privilege. Bush also brought to the White  House 

as
 an adviser Karl Rove, the man he called the “architect,” who planned 
323 
The Conservative Revolution 
the strategy by which Bush was elected both governor of Texas and 
President of the United States. 
Equally important to an extent was the minority whip in the  
Ho
use, Tom DeLay of Texas. He was another staunchly conservative Republi
-can who played po
liti
cal hardball and virtually cut the Demo
crats out 
of any involvement in the business of the  
House. He masterminded 
what was called the K Street Project, named after the street in Wash
-ington where many lobbying ﬁ
 rm
s are located. The word soon went 
out that if lobbyists wished to have any inﬂ
uence on legislation, their 

ﬁnancial contributions had to be Republican. Supporting Demo
crats 
would ensure defeat for any project the lobbyists might advance. Be
-cause many former members of Congress remained in Washington af
-ter they retired (or  
we
re retired by the electorate), they joined various 
lobbying companies and had easy access to the power brokers in Con
-gress. Therefore, a great deal of lobbyists’ money ﬂ
 owe
d into Republi
-cans’ campaigns, and with this advantage Tom DeLay exercised strict 

di
scipline on Republican  House members. The Texas legislature solidi
-ﬁed his leadership by gerrymandering ﬁ
ve additional Republican dis
-tricts, which increased that party’s majority in the U.S.  House of 

Re
presentatives. After the midterm election of 
2002
 the Republicans 
also controlled the Senate. Now the two branches of the federal 

government—the White  
House and  
Congress—were under one party, 
which meant that the President could and did dictate national policy. 

Throughout his ﬁrst term Bush did not veto a single piece of legislation. 
After a rather turbulent life as a young man, Bush became a  
bor
n-
again 
Christian, thanks to the efforts of his wife, Laura, and the Reverend 

Billy Graham. As President, he therefore inaugurated what he called a 

“faith-
based initiative” to provide federal support for  
church-
related pro
-grams that would include such ser
vi
ces as helping teenagers avoid preg
-nancy. He also forbade federal support of 
stem- 
cell research, one of the 
most modern techniques for exploring new ways to combat disease and 

advance health care. Clearly afﬁ
liated with the Religious Right, some
-thing Karl Rove believed would solidify the President’s conservative base 

an
d provide Republicans domination of national politics for years to 
come, Bush expected his administration to be morally above reproach, 

thereby restoring virtue to the operation of government. 
One of his most important actions, taken soon after his inauguration, 
324 
a short history of the united states 
was the proposed No Child Left Behind Act that aimed to improve pri
-mary and secondary schools by directing federal money toward those 
in
stitutions that raised the level of students’ perfor
mance in math, sci
-ence, and En
glish. B
y establishing federal standards in these academic 
areas—historians 
were particularly distressed because history was 
omitted from the  list—this legislation undercut the authority of local 

and state school boards. Critics argued that the program emphasized 

testing and not teaching. 
It soon became clear that the Bush administration supported and 
wish
ed to advance the interests of American business. That fact was 
emphasized by a secret meeting Vice President Cheney, a former CEO 

of Halliburton, a leading oil equipment company, held with executives 

from the 
oil-
producing companies. The participants agreed to an en
-ergy policy that approved the drilling of oil in Alaska’s National Wild
-life Refuge and provided subsidies for extracting oil from the Gulf 

of M
exico. The administration also interpreted the Clean Air Act so as 
to beneﬁ
t the electric utilities, and put the Environmental Protection 
Agency under the direction of men and women who understood the 

value of corporate participation. 
Inevitably, business leaders took advantage of the situation, and a 
nu
mber of corporate scandals resulted, the most prominent involving 
Enron, the  
Houston- 
based energy enterprise. Price rigging, fraudulent 
accounting practices, and insider trading all contributed to Enron’s col
-lapse. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and pensions. Ofﬁ
 cers 
of 
the company  
were indicted, found guilty, and imprisoned. Enron’s ac
-counting ﬁ
rm, the venerable Arthur Andersen Company, closed its 
doors as a result of its actions in attempting to cover up the scandal. 
Business especially beneﬁ
te
d from Bush’s insistence on cutting taxes. 
Like Reagan before him, Bush argued that the economy would grow as 

a result of tax cuts and that all citizens would share in the anticipated 

prosperity. The young President quickly implemented his plans. The 

Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 
2001
 cut income taxes, phased 
out the estate tax by 
2010
 unless Congress intervened, and extended 
the earned income credit for  
low-
income families and individuals. Two 
years later further tax cuts  
were enacted. The taxes on dividends and 
capital gains  
were reduced. And although  
middle-
class and  
low-
income 
families beneﬁ
ted by these cuts, the wealthy beneﬁ
ted the most. 
325 The Conservative Revolution 
This reduction in the amount of money obtained from taxpayers 
caused the national debt to rise to record levels. Unlike Reagan, who 
advocated tax reduction as a means of shrinking the government, Bush 

increased expenditures during his administration. The surpluses left by 

the Clinton administration quickly disappeared, and the national debt 

swelled to $
9 trillion. Much of this debt was owed to foreign investors, 
such as China, which also sold goods to the United States at cheaper 

prices than domestic products and thereby increased the nation’s huge 

trade imbalance. 
What made the debt situation worse was the ballooning Social Se
-curity and Medicare obligations resulting from those born immedi
-ately after World War  
II and known as the baby boomer generation 
who  
were nearing retirement. Sooner or later both Social Security and 
Medicare programs would need attention, but neither Congress nor 

the administration had any genuine solutions to potential shortfalls in 

these programs. 
The Bush administration also acted unilaterally in addressing for
-eign affairs. It abandoned the Kyoto Protocols, which set mandatory 

li
mits regarding atmospheric pollution, as well as UN conventions that 
banned biological weapons and nuclear tests. It behaved as though it 

could do as it pleased in foreign affairs and not be guided by the needs 

or wishes of other nations. 
And then came the blow. On September 
11, 200
1, terrorists, armed 
with box cutters, commandeered four airplanes and rammed two of 

them into the World Trade Center in New York City, killing nearly 

3,000 people. Another plane slammed into the Pentagon and killed 
almost 
200
. A fourth plane, headed for the Capitol or the White  
House 
in Washington, crashed in Pennsylvania when courageous passengers 

rebelled against the seizure of the plane and fought the terrorists. Pas
-sengers, crew members, and terrorists, numbering 
246
, died in the 
crash. These  
well-
planned and -executed operations  
were the work of a 
radical Muslim organization known as Al Qaeda, led and ﬁ
 nanced by 
Osama bin Laden, and supported by Taliban leaders in Af
ghan 
istan 
who had seized control of the country in 
1996
, after ﬁ
 rst overthrowing 
a government supported by the Soviet  
Union. The United States had 
assisted the Taliban in its struggle for in
de pen
dence since this hap
-pened during the Cold War. The Muslim radicals regarded the United 
326 
a short history of the united states 
States as the “great Satan” who with the arrogance of power sought to 
di
ctate policy in the Middle East, especially in its support of Israel. 
At ﬁrst Bush seemed dazed by what had happened on 
9/11, as it 
came to be known, but he soon rallied and called on the nation to end 

terrorism in the world, promising to vanquish Al Qaeda and capture 

Osama bin Laden “dead or alive.” Congress promptly passed a resolu
-tion by which the President was given sweeping powers to “use all 

ne
cessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or 
persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 

terrorist attacks that occurred on September 
11, 2001
.” With the coop
-eration of Britain and other nations, he immediately attacked Afghan
-istan, and, after extensive bombing raids and advances by ground forces, 

to
ppled the Taliban regime within six months and knocked out Al 
Qaeda’s operations in that country. But both bin Laden and many of 

the Al Qaeda leaders escaped, probably into remote areas of northern 

Afghan 
istan and southern and eastern Pakistan. As late as 
2008
 bin 
Laden remained at large, although by that time he was more a symbol 

of Muslim terror than a strategic operator, and the Al Qaeda network 

was back in full operation. 
An interim government was established in Afghan
ista
n and demo
-cratically elected a president, Hamid Karzai. But his authority was 

li
mited to an area around the capital city of Kabul while various war
-lords controlled the countryside. The Taliban also remained a power 

wit
hin Af
ghan 
istan and by the spring of 
2007 had begun a renewed 
ﬁght to regain control. Unfortunately, Bush made no effort to see the 
intervention in Af
ghan 
istan to a successful conclusion. Instead he di
-rected his attention toward another Middle Eastern target, Iraq. 
It has been suggested that Bush most likely aimed to overthrow 
Sa
ddam Hussein on becoming President, and he had the active support 
of his Vice President, Richard Cheney, and his Secretary of Defense, 

Donald Rumsfeld. The refusal of his father to pursue Hussein follow
-ing the Gulf War may have played an essential part of his thinking, 

th
at is, he would ﬁ
nish what his father had left undone. In a public an
-nouncement he denounced the regimes of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea 

as a
n “axis of evil, aiming to threaten the peace of the world.” These 
nations, he believed, 
were seeking to develop or in fact had developed 
chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons of mass destruction (WMD). 
327 The Conservative Revolution 
Bush also insisted that the war on terrorism necessitated the United 
States to “deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed.” In 
other words, this novel and dangerous policy meant that the United 

States could and would act preemptively and alone, if necessary. This 

was a major alteration of American foreign policy and would lead to an 

undermining of its inﬂ
uence and authority in western Eu
rope and 
other parts of the world. The United States was seen as the “bully” of 

the globe, intent on imposing its will, policies, and goals on other na
-tions. 
This war on terror and the need to protect national security drove 
the Bush administration farther into pursuing actions that increased 
presidential prerogatives so that oversight of its activities, whether by 

Congress or the courts, could be sidestepped. In the fall of 
2001
 the 
Patriot Act (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appro
-priate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism) was passed 

by whi
ch the federal government assumed unparalleled authority to 
obtain information about the activities of citizens and apprehend likely 

terrorists. A second Patriot Act, passed in 
2003,
 expanded the govern-
ment’s surveillance and secret arrest powers. What troubled many 

Americans was the fact that the administration had the unlimited au
-thority to wiretap citizens without ﬁ
 rs
t obtaining a court order. In ex
-ercising its increased powers, the government rounded up over 
1,000 su
spects, some of them American citizens, and locked them up in a 
camp in Guantanamo, Cuba. Few  
were brought to trial. The adminis
-tration felt it had the right to bypass the courts in the name of national 

se
curity. 
The Homeland Security Department was established in 
20
02; 
twenty-
two different agencies, including immigration, naturalization, 
customs, Secret Ser
vice, coast guard, and airport operators were incor
-porated into this one department. FEMA (Federal Emergency Man
-agement Agency) was mistakenly added to Homeland Security, as was 

demo
nstrated shortly thereafter when Hurricane Katrina struck the 
Gulf coast on August 
29, 2005,
 and it failed to adequately assist the vic
-tims of this storm. After the Defense Department, Homeland 
Security 

had mo
re employees than any other federal agency. Many citizens rightly 
worried that civil liberties and privacy rights would be violated. 
Emboldened by the opportunity to assume even greater power in 
328 
a short history of the united states 
running the government, the Bush administration decided to launch a 
pr
eemptive attack against Iraq. Encouraged by his close associate Vice 
President Cheney; the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld; and the 

deputy secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, with the active support of the Na
-tional Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and the reluctant agree
-ment of the Secretary of State, Colin  
Po
well, President Bush decided 
to ask Congress for authority to overthrow the Hussein dictatorship. 

These advisers expected the Iraqi people to welcome an American in
-vasion and bring a mea
sure o
f democracy to the country. More trou
-bling was the fear that Hussein had obtained biological and chemical 

weap
ons and was attempting to obtain uranium deposits from Niger in 
Africa in order to build weapons of mass destruction, even though UN 

weapons inspectors had failed to discover any trace of WMD within 

Iraq. The Bush advisers also believed that Hussein had connections 

with Al Qaeda operatives stationed around the world. In all, the evi
-dence seemed overwhelming to support a military strike to spare hu
-manity a catastrophic blow. 
The trouble with this evidence was that none of it was true. There 
were no
 WMD in Iraq; nor 
were there connections to Al Qaeda. Intel
-ligence agencies in the government tried to alert the administration to 

th
ese errors, but they 
were ignored. Brent Scowcroft, the former Na
-tional Security Adviser to George H. W. Bush, warned that an inva
-sion of Iraq “could turn the 
who
le region,” not simply Iraq itself, “into 
a cauldron, and thus destroy the war on terrorism.” 
On October 
10, 200
2, Congress, including many Demo
crats in both 
houses who voted with the Republican majority, some of whom later 

repudiated their action, agreed to permit a preemptive strike against 

Iraq. Still the Bush administration held back for the moment, when 

foreign nations disapproved. On November 
8, the UN unanimously 
passed a resolution giving Iraq three and a half months to permit 

weapons inspectors to determine whether WMD actually existed 

within the country. Hussein had expelled the inspectors in 
1998
, but 
now he agreed to their return, and although he had no WMD he regu
-larly, and foolishly, created problems for the inspectors in carry
ing out 
their assignment. He was also required to produce a full statement of 

his country’s weaponry. 
The Bush administration, itching to start a war with Iraq, chose to 
329 The Conservative Revolution 
believe that the action of the Iraqi dictator proved he had hidden 
WMD and therefore had violated the UN resolution. In February 

2003
, Secretary of State Powell spoke before the UN and argued the 
case for war. But France, Russia, and Germany opposed any such ac
-tion and the UN refused to sanction the U.S. demand. Frustrated but 

sti
ll determined to take action, Bush went ahead and signaled the start 
of a U.S/British assault on March 
19 to topple Hussein. He asserted 
the claim that the United States “has the sovereign authority to use 

force in assuring its own national security.” He argued that the invasion 

was linked to the continuing war against terrorism. 
The invasion of Iraq proved to be one of the most disastrous foreign 
po
licy mistakes ever committed by the United States. A relatively small, 
high-
tech force was employed; no plans had been devised about occu
-pying the country; and no plans had been worked out as to how and 

when A
merican forces would be withdrawn. 
The actual war proceeded rapidly. A co 
ali
tion of armed forces from 
a number of Eu
ropean countries, including Spain, Italy, Poland, and 
several other nations, was formed. About 
150
,000 American troops 
based in Kuwait, along with a smaller British force, swept northward 

and overwhelmed the Iraqi army, which melted away. Hussein disap
-
peared, the major cities 
were ca
ptured, and looting by the native popu
-lation began immediately. A nearly total breakdown of essential ser
vic
es 
like water and electricity resulted, and Iraq headed toward civil war 

between Sunni Muslims who had ruled the country with Hussein and 

Shiite Muslims who represented the majority of the people in Iraq. On 

May 
1, 2003
, Bush ﬂ
ew to the aircraft carrier 
Abraham Lincoln
, and 
standing under a banner that read “Mission Accomplished,” he an
-nounced to cheering sailors and a live televi
sion audience of millions 

th
at the war against Iraq had been successfully ended. 
Nothing could have been farther from the truth. To be sure, it was 
no
t a war that the United States had fought before against enemy 
armies. This was a war of random car bombings, kidnappings, mortar 

attacks, and guerrilla opposition to what was seen by many Iraqis as an 

occupation army, not a liberating force. The Bush administration had 

been warned that it would take a much larger army than the one pro
-vided to subdue the country and restore law and order. But under the 

mi
staken belief of Secretary Rumsfeld that his 
so-called 
high-
tech 
330 
a short history of the united states 
army could do the job just as well, the country quickly became cha
-otic. 
In the summer of 
200
3, a Co
ali
tion Provisional Authority headed by 
Ambassador Paul Bremer established a Governing Council to run Iraq. 
A heavily fortiﬁ
ed “Green Zone” was set up to protect the ofﬁ
 cials of 
this government against the rising number of terrorist militiamen, who 

singled out American soldiers, workers, ofﬁ
cials, and their allies for as
-sassination. By the spring of 
2008
 over 4,000 American soldiers had 
been killed in Iraq and thousands more severely wounded. Millions of 

Iraqis ﬂ
ed the country, fearing for their lives. And the United States 
suspected and later offered proof that Iran, an overwhelming Shiite na
-tion, was supplying the insurgents with weapons. 
The unexpected but dramatic capture of Saddam Hussein, found 
hid
ing underground in December 
2003
, provided at least a semblance 
of success in ﬁ
ghting this war, but it did not deter terrorists from their 
almost daily assault on both the Americans and native Iraqis. Hussein 

himself was later tried, found guilty, and hanged. The reputation of the 

United States was further damaged when cameras graphically revealed 

the barbaric use of torture by Americans of prisoners held in Baghdad’s 

Abu Ghraib prison in April 
2004
. In violation of the Geneva Conven
-tions, U.S. military personnel posed for pictures that showed naked 

prisoners in grotesque positions or being threatened by vicious dogs. 
Several of these U.S. guards were later tried by a military court and 

convicted. Further embarrassment ensued when weapons inspectors 

concluded that what
ever biological and chemical weapons Hussein 
might have had  
were most likely destroyed before the country was in
-vaded. Slowly Americans began to realize that the war should never 

have bee
n waged. 
And the war raged on. Terrorists broadened their attacks to include 
th
e British consulate in Istanbul in November 
2003
 that resulted in 
scores of deaths. In March 
2004
, a well-
coordinated bombing of Ma-
drid’s subways resulted in the killing of over 
200
 people. The newly 
elected Spanish government immediately withdrew its troops from the 

coali
tion in Iraq. 
Another reason for the intense hatred of the United States by Mus
-lim terrorists was the continuing support America had provided Israel, 

a hat
red that intensiﬁ
ed because of Israeli settlements in the West 
331 
The Conservative Revolution 
Bank and the Gaza Strip, and Israel’s re
sistance to Palestinians’ de
-mands for a separate and in
de pen
dent state. The killing of both Israelis 
and Palestinians grew worse. Hamas, a militant terrorist group in Pal
-estine, sworn to Israel’s destruction, or
ga
nized car bombings in crowded 
Jewish communities. Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, ordered 
a massive strike to kill off the Hamas leadership. At ﬁ
rst the Bush ad
-ministration tried to duck from any involvement in the dispute, but it 

la
ter reversed itself and joined with the UN in attempting to work out 
a peace agreement by which a Palestinian nation would be formed and 

Israel recognized by Arabs as an in
de pen
dent state in the Middle East. 
Negotiations at times seemed to go forward, but at other times they 

verged on collapse. When Ariel Sharon suffered a severe stroke, he was 

replaced by Ehud Olmert. And the killing just went on and on. 
As the presidential 
elec
tion of 
2004
 approached, Demo
crats 
found themselves in a difﬁ
cult situation. They could not oppose the war 
without appearing unpatriotic but they also knew that the war was 
poorly planned and executed. Furthermore, they feared being seen as 

lacking support for the troops in the ﬁ
eld. And in ﬁ
nding a candidate, 
they needed someone who could provide the kind of leadership expected 

in a President, especially during war
time. As the primary season got 
under way, Vermont’s governor, Dr. Howard Dean, took the lead among 

several possible Demo
cratic candidates by opposing the war and attract
-ing large ﬁ
nancial contributions via the Internet. But after a slow and 
shaky start, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts pulled ahead because 

of his heroic exploits during the Vietnam War. Indeed, he had been 

wounded twice in that war and decorated for bravery. To many Demo
-crats he appeared to be the leader they needed to bring the Iraqi war to a 

sw
ift conclusion. Kerry was nominated for the presidency, along with 
Senator John Edwards of North Carolina as Vice President. 
During the campaign Kerry and Edwards insisted that Bush’s tax 
cu
ts had beneﬁ
ted the wealthy at the expense of the middle and poorer 
classes of Americans. They also offered a program to protect Social 

Security, prevent outsourcing of American jobs overseas, improve 

funding for education, and insure better health care for all citizens. But 

the only real issue Americans responded to was who could best provide 
332 
a short history of the united states 
the leadership necessary in this  
on- 
going war against terrorism. Demo
-crats praised Kerry’s heroic war record and questioned Bush’s failure to 
serve i
n the Vietnam War, arguing that his enlistment in the Air Na
-tional Guard was just a con
veni
ent escape from the more dangerous 
task of ﬁ
 ghting in the jungles of Vietnam. Republicans struck back by 
suggesting that Kerry’s record in the war was fake. A group called 

Swift Boat Veterans for Truth claimed that his supposed heroism was a 

lie, a falsehood that Kerry did not immediately dispute. Even worse 

was his voting record in the Senate where he “voted against before vot
-ing for” a par
tic 
ular bill. He was dubbed a “ﬂ
 ip-
ﬂopper,” one who could 
not make up his mind about anything and tried to have it both ways. 

As for the war in Iraq, Bush insisted during the campaign that the 

country must “stay the course.” To pull out would spell victory for ter
-rorism and sink Iraq into a worse chaotic state than it already suffered. 
Another issue that ﬁ
gu
red prominently in this election was  
same-
sex 
marriage. The Massachusetts supreme court ruled that marriage of gay 

couples could not be denied, an argument repeated by some politicians 

in Oregon and California. Bush himself said he favored a constitu
-tional amendment banning  
sam
e-
sex marriage. This issue triggered a 
strong reaction among evangelical groups, who came out in record 

numbers to vote for the “born again” Christian, George W. Bush. 

Their appearance at the polls seemed to vindicate the contention of 

Bush’s close po
liti
cal adviser, Karl Rove, that capturing the evangelical 
base was essential to success. Not surprisingly, eleven states passed 

mea
sures outlawing  
same-
sex marriages. 
Bush triumphed, capturing 
51 per
cent of the pop ular vote to Kerry’s 
48 percent. But it was a closer election in the electoral college, where 
Bush received 
279 votes to Kerry’s 
252. Had Ohio gone to Kerry, its 
20 electoral votes would have reversed the outcome. And that state also 

passed a ban on gay marriage by 
62 percent, the issue that undoubtedly 
brought many conservatives to the polls in Ohio and gave Bush the vic
-tory by a narrow margin. 
Bush chose to interpret his success as a mandate to continue the war 
un
til the terrorists had been subdued and a democracy established in 
Iraq. He claimed he had acquired considerable politi
cal capital from 
this election, which he planned to use to further his plans for reducing 
333 The Conservative Revolution 
taxes, reforming Medicare, and reor 
ganiz ing other social insurance 
projects by encouraging the participation of private business entities. 
S o the wa r 
in Iraq continued unabated, and with each passing 
mo
nth public approval for Bush lessened as the killing, especially of 
Iraqi civilians, mounted. Furthermore, the cost of the war each month 

soared into the billions of dollars. At the same time both Bush and 

Vice President Cheney assured the nation that great progress was being 

made and victory was imminent. In the summer of 
2004
, the Co
ali
tion 
Provisional Authority transferred its authority to an interim Iraqi gov
-ernment, and Paul Bremer returned home. He was replaced by U.S. 

Am
bassador Zalmay Khalilzad. Then, in January 
2005
, a national 
election was held to elect an assembly that would write a new constitu
-tion for Iraq. Kurds from the north and Shiites from the south re
-sponded heartily to this  
op
portunity—the Sunnis in the central section 
less 
so—and together they formed a co 
ali
tion government. In October, 
a new constitution was approved and Nuri 
al-
Maliki was chosen as 
prime minister. Ambassador Khalilzad worked out an agreement to 

amend the constitution so that Sunnis could participate in this govern
-ment, but nothing came of it. Khalilzad was replaced in March 
2007 by th
e veteran diplomat Ryan Crocker. 
Then, on February 
22, 2006, th
e war took a turn for the worse when 
terrorists—presumably  
Sunnis—destroyed one of the holiest of Shiite 
shrines, the  
gold- 
domed Askariya Mosque in Samarra, and Iraq de
-scended into 
full-
scale civil war. Hundreds of corpses, many with visible 
signs of torture, 
were discovered in alleys and vacant lots. It has been 
estimated that at least 
10,000 civilians died in the ﬁ
nal months of 
2006. The situation had become so bad that the American people began 
havi
ng doubts about prolonging the war. And an increasing majority 
felt the invasion had been a mistake. Bush’s popularity went into a 

steep decline and fell into the 
30 percent approval range. Secretary of 
Defense Rumsfeld also faced mounting criticism, even from the military, 

and he later resigned from ofﬁce. A number of retired generals voiced 

their complaints about how the war had been initiated, how it had been 

planned and executed, and how unacceptable was the cost in lives and 
334 
a short history of the united states 
money. By 
2006 over $
300 billion had been spent in prosecuting the 
war. And Bush kept asking for additional supplements. 
Further mistakes by the Bush administration followed. A contract, 
ap
proved for a company in Dubai owned by the United Arab Emirates 
to operate American seaports, set off a pop 
ular protest. Even Republi
-can members of Congress expressed outrage. Bush had no choice but to 
qua
sh the  
arrangement—and he did so on March 
10, 2006. An even 
worse disaster for the administration developed on August 
29, 2005
, when Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast and devastated 

the region. New Orleans was especially  
hard-
hit because the storm 
breached the levees holding back the Mississippi River and water poured 

through the city, destroying homes and drowning thousands of people. 

The 
low-
lying districts where poor blacks lived took the heaviest blow. 
For days stranded people stood on the roofs of their devastated homes 

and held up signs that read “Help.” Thousands ﬂ
ed the city. Many of 

the poorest inhabitants who had no way of escaping  were crowded into 

the Superdome, where the facilities could not keep up with demand. 

The administration failed to respond adequately: FEMA was especially 

criticized for its failure to appreciate how serious the problem had be
-come and how inadequate its attempts to deal with the situation. 
Other scandals surfaced. Jack Abramoff, a  
well-heeled lobbyist who 
had close ties to the Republican leadership, was indicted and pleaded 

guilty to conspiracy to corrupt public ofﬁ
cials, mail fraud, and tax eva
-sion. He named congressmen who had aided him in his schemes and 

accept
ed bribes, free golf trips to Scotland, and other gratuities. Tom 
DeLay, the  
House majority leader from Texas, was indicted for his in
-volvement in the Texas gerrymandering scheme, which netted the Re
-publicans additional seats in the U.S.  
Ho
use of Representatives. He 
was forced to give up his leadership position, and he subsequently re
-
signed from the 
Ho
use. Representative Randy “Duke” Cunningham, a 
Republican from California, went to prison for accepting millions in 

bribes; and Mark Foley, a Republican representative from Florida, was 

forced to resign because of improper messages he sent to former male 

pages in the  
House. The Vice President’s chief of staff, I. Lewis 
(Scooter) Libby, was indicted on charges of perjury and obstruction of 

justice in a case growing out of the unlawful disclosure of a CIA agent 

in order to penalize critics of the Iraq war. He was found guilty of four 
335 The Conservative Revolution 
counts of felony in March 
2007. Demo
crats charged Republicans with 
a “culture of corruption” that permeated Congress because of their 
twelve-year control. 
In the midterm election on November 
7, 2006, th
e Demo
crats scored 
a victory that no one anticipated. It had been expected that the  House 

would go Demo
cratic, but not the Senate. To everyone’s surprise the 
Demo
crats did indeed capture the upper  house, by a single vote. Un
-questionably, the war in Iraq was the crucial issue that decided the 

out
come of this election. The American people wanted a quick resolu
-tion to the problem and the return of U.S. troops. The Iraq Study 

Grou
p—a bipartisan panel cochaired by a Republican, James A. Baker, 
former secretary of state under George H. W. Bush; and a Democrat, 

Lee H. Hamilton, former member of the  
House of Representatives 
from Indiana, that the Bush administration initially opposed but then 

changed its mind and gave grudging  support—recommended a com
-plete change of direction by the government. It advised that the admin
-istration initiate a diplomatic offensive and cease making “an  
open
- ended 
commitment to keep large numbers of American troops deployed in 

Iraq.” But the President chose to pursue a different course and decided 

to increase the number of American soldiers in the combat zone. He 

called it a “surge” that would bring ultimate victory. No longer aiming 

to make Iraq a democracy, Bush now settled for an end of violence and 

the establishment of a government that could provide stability. 
For the past six years there had been relatively no oversight by Con
-gress on the intrusion of the executive into areas beyond what the Con
-stitution allowed. Wiretapping of citizens without judicial authorization, 

signing legislation and directing exceptions to the law, and advancing 
presidential authority at the expense of Congress now came to a screech
-ing halt when the Demo
crats assumed majority status of the legislature 

in J
anuary 
2007. One of the ﬁ
 rst remarkable things they did was elect 
Nancy Pelosi of California as Speaker of the  
House of Representatives. 
She was the ﬁ
rst woman to hold that ofﬁ
ce, having served previously as 
minority leader. She promised a long list of legislative action by the 

House: increase the minimum wage, support the recommendations of 

the Iraq Study Group, allow Medicare to negotiate for better drug 

prices, call a halt to sending more troops to Iraq, reduce interest rates 

on college loans, and other reforms in the ﬁ
 rst 
100
 hours (not days) of 
336 
a short history of the united states 
Demo
cratic control. Committee chairmanships  
were assumed and a 
series of investigations begun that uncovered activities in the White 
House that demonstrated how far and how aggressive had been the ef
-forts of the administration to expand and protect presidential powers. 
Most important of all, both the Senate and the  
Ho
use in March 
2007 passed supplemental spending bills for the war that included a 
provision calling for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq by 

2008
. Bush vetoed it, and the Democrats  
were unable to override it. He 
also threatened to veto any bill that came before him if it contained a 

benchmark giving a date for withdrawal. Democrats insisted that their 

action was in accordance with what the electorate had demanded just 

six months earlier. Critics now declared that the war was unwinnable 

and might lead to sectarian violence not only in the Middle East but 

throughout the Muslim world. By the end of 
2007 the Democrats com
-pletely failed in their efforts to end the war. They lacked the necessary 

votes in the Senate to block ﬁ
libusters, and the Republicans in the 
House stood united behind the President in preventing the override of 

his vetoes. By the beginning of 
2008
 the Democrats had little to show 
for their astounding victory in 
2006 in ending the war. 
In the meantime Iran continued to develop a nuclear program in 
deﬁan
ce of UN resolutions demanding a halt to such activities. The 
likelihood of atomic weapons reaching radical terrorists became fright
-eningly possible. The United States, the only superpower in the world, 

had lo
st the respect of most nations and its ability to enforce peaceful 
solutions to international problems. Some Americans even wondered if 

their Great Republic was now in full decline, its place as the world 

leader to be taken by the rising powers of China or India. They were 

shocked at ﬁ
nding themselves disliked and criticized by the people of 
many countries around the world. And because of mounting foreclo
-sures on homes resulting from subprime lending practices, the increase 

of
 unemployment, the weakness of the dollar overseas, an erratic stock 
market, and climbing gasoline and food prices, it appeared at the be
-ginning of 
2008
 th
at the nation was headed toward a recession. 
Still, America’s large consumer society, technological superiority, 
an
d creative genius remained viable and gave hope that its people could 
ﬁnd the leadership that would bring the country safely through this 
trying period of their history.
