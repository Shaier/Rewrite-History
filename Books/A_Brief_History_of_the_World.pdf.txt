1A Brief History of the World 
 Scope: This course presents some of the highlights of the world historical approach to 
the past, suggesting major changes in the framework of the human experience, 

from the rise of agriculture 
to the present day. The lectures cover the emergence 
of distinct major societies as they deal with common problems but generate 

quite different institutional and cultural approaches. The course also discusses 

key changes in belief systemsŠthe emer
gence and spread of the great world religions, for exampleŠas well as alterations in trading patterns and basic shifts 

in technology, exploring why some societies reacted
 differently to technological change than others.  
Throughout the course, we will look at many
 parts of the world, including those clustered into shared civilizations. East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and 
the Mediterranean loom large from the 
start. Sub-Saharan Africa, where the human species originated, has also played
 a great role in world history, as 
ultimately has northern Europe, including Russia. The Americas offer an 

important variant until their incorpora
tion in global patterns from 1492 onward. 
Central Asia maintained a distinct position in world history until the 16
th century. World history divides into a limited number of time periods, defined in terms of 
dominant themes. The rise of agriculture requires a discussion of pre-

agricultural patterns. Following agriculture came, in several places, the advent 
of civilization as a form of human organization. The classical period in world 

history draws attention to China, India, Persia, and the Mediterranean, when the 

expansion and integration of these large societies dominated over a millennium 

of human history. The collapse of the classical empires ushered in a vital 

postclassical period, when emphasis shifted to religion but also to more 

ambitious patterns of interregional trade. It was in this postclassical period 
(500Œ1500 CE) that the emphasis of major societies shifted from separate 
development to greater interaction a
nd even deliberate imitation. The early 
modern period highlights a renewed capacity for empire, the inclusion of the 

Americas in global systems, andŠthough this must be handled with a bit of 

careŠthe rise of Western Europe. What some historians call the ﬁLong 19
th CenturyﬂŠ1750 or so to 1914Šwas dominated by Western industrialization 

and its economic, military, and cultural impact on, literally, the entire world. 

Finally, the contemporary period in world history, after World War I, features a 

bewildering variety of themes that must be sorted out, with emphasis among 

other things on the relative decline of the West, the huge surge in human 

population, and the potential for greater globalization.  
World history highlights a number of major regions, but it avoids simply 
examining one area after anotherŠﬁif it™s Tuesday, this must be Latin 

AmericaﬂŠby making careful compar
isons and focusing on interregional  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
2 contacts. The discipline emphasizes a number of key time periods (though not 
an indefinite number), defined in terms of basic changes in the ways many 

societies operated, whether the change was in an economic systemŠ

industrialization, for exampleŠor a cultural system, as seen, for example, in the 

emergence of vigorous missionary religions. 
World history also embraces two common 
themes. First, and most obviously, is 
the eternal tension between change and continuityŠthe stuff of history as a 
discipline. Particularly once the classical traditions are defined, world history 
can be seen in terms of new forces being met and interpreted by established 

cultural and institutional systems. Of course, these systems change but never 

completely and never in exactly the same ways from one society to the next. 
The second theme involves a perpetual interplay between local or regional 
identities, on the one hand, and the attraction or simple inevitability of wider 

contacts, on the other. Societies began trading at long distances several 

millennia ago. They received immigrants
 and diseases and, sometimes, ideas 
from distant places. But they rarely, at 
least willingly, simply surrendered to 
outside influence, and sometimes they battled fiercely against such influence in 

the name of established values. Over time, of course, and particularly with 

contemporary globalization, the pendulum shifted toward more outside 

influence, either willingly embraced or endured of necessity. But the tension has 
not ended, and assertions of regional identities can intensify precisely because the external framework is so intrusive. 
World history allows us to trace the main 
iterations of this tension and to place its current iteration in contextŠand even, tentatively, to talk about its future.

3Lecture One  What and Why Is World History? 
 Scope: World history has been gaining gr
ound rapidly as a teaching field over the past 20 years, although studies in this discipline also encounter 
objections, including questions about feasibility. The field advances because of the growing need for historical perspective on global relationships and cultural differences around the world, because of changing political demands among Am
erican students, and because world history scholarship itself improves, particularly for certain time 

periods, highlighting a number of interesting findings and 

interpretations. World history also unsettles certain kinds of 

assumptions, particularly about the longstanding superiority of Western 

values and experiences. The field requires careful choice of focus; even though it concerns the whole world, it does not encompass everything. 
Three overlapping approaches define the real heart of the world history 
enterprise: comparison, contact, a
nd global forces. Each of these 
approaches reminds us that world history is not just, or primarily, a list 

of facts but an invitation to use facts in historical analysis and to ask 

and answer key questions about the human experience.  
 Outline I. The rise of world history has been one of the most important developments 
in American history education and sc
holarship over the past two decades.  II. There are three major approaches to
 world historyŠusually applied in 
combinationŠthat help scholars decide what topics to focus on. 
A. The first approach involves studyi
ng major civilizations to determine 
how they developed and how they helped define the experience of 
many people in societies around the world. This approach brings major 

civilizations together to compare wh
at they share and how they differ. B. The second approach involves paying attention to cases where major 
societies, including civilizations, come into contact with each other. 
Scholars look at how this contact occurs and how it changes both 

parties, using this information as
 a framework to explore far-reaching 
changes in the experience of peoples around the world. 
C. The third approach emphasizes the 
emergence of broader forces that 
help define contacts and the experi
ences of individual civilizations. 
Such forces include new trade or migration patterns, new disease 

patterns, and new missionary efforts. 
D. These three approaches are us
ually used in combination.  
  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
4 III. These three approaches help us define key time periods in world history. 
A. The time periods, in turn, are often delineated by changes in patterns of 
contact or changes in broader forces, such as the diffusion of new 
technologies or the emergence of new trade patterns. 
B. The time periods we will look at in th
is course are as follows: classical (1000 BCEŒ500 CE), postclassical (500
1450), early modern (1450 
CEŒ1750/1800 CE), Long 19
th Century (1750Œ1914), and 
contemporary. 
IV. The rise of world history as an 
academic discipline has been unusual in 
several respects.  A. World history emerged more as a teaching field than as a research 
field.  B. World history did not develop initially at the most prestigious 
universities in the United States.  
C. The field of world history is not evenly developed around the world.  
1. A great deal of progress has been made in the United States, and 
interesting work has been done in China and Japan. 
2. A few European countries, such as the Netherlands, have 
developed significant world history programs. 
3. But the United Kingdom, although it contributes important 

scholarship to world history, has yet to introduce the topic in its 

educational programs.
  V. Three factors fuel the increasi
ng interest in world history. 
A. The first factor involves changes 
in the composition of the American 
student body. A growing number of students in American universities 
come from backgrounds that are not American, and there is a demand 

for teaching that reflects this diversity. B. The second factor is the extent to which the United States, since the 
1950s, has become engaged with the non-European world. This 

engagement logically propels us to look for a historical perspective that 

gives us some context for understanding the world at large, rather than 

one important but narrow slice of it. 
C. The world history perspective can be used to gain a better 
understanding of crucial historical events and processes. 
VI. We also need to look at the deba
te surrounding the idea of teaching world history. 
A. World history inevitably challe
nges older teaching approaches, particularly the tradition of Western civilization. This continues to 
generate disputes between world history advocates and traditionalists. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
51. The Western civilization traditi
on traces a line of historical development from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to Greece and 
Rome, then on to Western Europe, and ultimately, to North 

America. 
2. This approach asserts that because
 the United States is part of the Western tradition, its students should pay particular attention to the 

emergence of Western institutions and values.  
B. Some world historians approach th
e teaching of world history as an exercise in ﬁWest-bashing,ﬂ but others take a more considered position: 
it is more important for American students to learn something about the 
world as a whole, including how the West fits into larger world 

patterns, than it is to learn about the Western tradition more narrowly. 
1. World historians also argue that the opportunity to learn how the 
West developed, its distinctive features, and its contributions to the 

global experience is not lost in the study of world history as 

opposed to Western civilization. 
2. The choice of world history in
 a teaching program involves a 
different set of emphases from the Western civilization tradition. 

Scholars of world history seek to avoid the ﬁWest-and-the-restﬂ 

approach, which focuses on the 
Western experience with brief 

mentions of other societies. The more thoughtful approach looks at 

Western civilization as one of a number of major civilizationsŠ

and not always the most important one. 
C. A second concern about the teach
ing of world history, raised particularly by historians of East Asian civilizations, is that the field 

cannot adequately convey the comp
lexities of individual traditions. Chinese history, for example, is 
so nuanced and complex that it is 
inevitably simplified if taught as only one part of a broader course.  
D. The third objection, raised recently 
as some Europeans have attempted 
to insert themselves into a world history framework, is that the field is 

somehow yet another product of American imperialism. 
1. To some extent, this objection seems to coincide with criticisms of 
American foreign policy. 
2. It may also reflect an understandable anxiety that American world 
historians would slight the European experience, although most 
world historians in the United States make an effort to deal 

evenhandedly with the experiences of various societies. 
VII.  In terms of chronology in world history, we need to be aware of three 
kinds of emphases. 
A. The first is the emphasis on origins. In the world history context, this 
approach pays greater attention to 
the emergence of human societies, 
sometimes at the expense of more recent developments. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
6 B. The second approach acknowledges that the greatest contributions of 
world history scholarship to our understanding of the past apply 
particularly to the postclassical period (roughly 500Œ1450) and the time 

right after the early modern period.  
C. The final approachŠand the one we will useŠviews both the early 
and middle phases of world history as contributing to an active modern 

period and uses the modern period, in turn, to help understand the 

world in the present day.  VIII. Let us look at an overall framework 
and a few final definitions for the course. A. World historians, like any analytically sensitive historians, are 
interested in the balance and tensions between change and continuity.  
1. At times, world history seems to focus particularly on changes, but 
we will also pay attention to continuities among human societies.  
2. The civilizational approach will help us track continuities and 
traditions in juxtaposition with new elements in the global 
framework. 
B. We will also look at the tension 
between developments and identities 
formed in particular localities or regions and the advantages of contact 

and exposure to crosscutting forces.  1. We will see that up until about 1,000 years ago, the human 
experience probably placed more emphasis on the local and the 
regional than on contact and broader forces.  
2. For the past 1,000 years up to t
oday, the human experience places 
more emphasis on contact and crosscutting forces and less 

emphasis on local and regional developments and identities, but 

the tension between the two el
ements is always present. 
C. This course will look primarily at 
seven civilizational/geographic areas: East Asia, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East (and, later, the 

Middle East and North Africa), Eastern Europe, Western Europe, sub-

Saharan Africa, and Latin America. 
D. We will use BCE (Before the Common Era) and CE (Common Era) as 
our main chronological divides.  
 1. This terminology replaces the tr
aditional use of BC (before Christ) and AD (anno Domini, ﬁin the year of the Lordﬂ)
 in world history.  
 2. This convention steers us away fro
m the Christian definitions used 
in Western-focused history and reminds us that we are operating in 

a global environment. 
E. We will see different reasons for the choices of certain dates to mark 
specific periods.  1. World historians conventionally end the postclassical period 
around 1450 CE, then pick up the early modern period.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
72. The year 1450 CE has some relationship to the Renaissance and 
the Reformation, major periods in traditional Western history, but 
the year also relates to important developments in the Middle East 

and North Africa, Russia and Eastern Europe, and in the 

relationship between the Americas and the rest of the world.

n to some? Is this a rift that can 
be healed? 
2. One world historian once proclaimed that the field depended on a key 
principle: dare to omit. But what criteria can world historians use to decide 
what to omit? Are some parts of the world less important than others? Are 

some periods of time less vital than others? Can the three basic approaches 

to world history help deal with the decisions on what to omit?

8 Lecture Two 
 The Neolithic Revolution  Scope: The rise of agriculture was one 
of the great changes in the human 
experience. Many important developments occurred before this, yet the 
emergence of agriculture was neither tidy nor uniform, and this 

messiness must be taken into account when studying this period. The 

fact is that agriculture greatly changed the nature of life for most 
people around the world. Further, much of what we deal with in world 

history involves societies that were primarily agricultural. Indeed, the 

world is still grappling with the legacies of agricultural patterns and the 

incomplete transition between agricultural and more urban and 

industrial ways of life. 
 Outline I. Agriculture began around 9000 BCE. Between the emergence of humans 
about 2.5 million years ago until about
 11,000 years ago, our species was involved in hunting and gathering. This long period between the emergence 

of our species and the rise of agriculture raises three important points. 
A. Between 2.5 million years ago and 
about 100,000 years ago, the human 
species went through a variety of evol
utionary phases in different parts 
of the world. 
1. Early versions of the human speci
es originated in East Africa and migrated to different parts of the world.  
2. Homo sapiens sapiens
 emerged about 120,000 years ago, and from 
that point onward, there have been no major evolutionary changes 
in the human experience. 
B. The human species, even before 
Homo sapiens sapiens
, was a tool-
using animal, more adept than other species at finding tools for 
hunting, gathering, or use as weapons. During the Mesolithic era (c. 12,000 BCE) and the Neolithic era (c. 8000 BCE) tool useŠand, by extension, domestication of some animalsŠbecame increasingly 

deliberate, setting a framework for th
e emergence of agriculture itself. 
C. Massive migration is particularly vital to world history.  
1. Some thousands of years after the species originated in East 
Africa, Homo sapiens sapiens
 began to pour out into other regions 
and, ultimately, around the world. The reason for this migration is 

simply that hunter-gatherer societies require as much as 2.5 square 

miles of space per person. 
2. By 25,000 BCE, 
Homo sapiens sapiens
 occupied virtually every 
place in the world that is currently inhabited, except New Zealand, some other Pacific islands, and Bermuda.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
9II. Human history begins at a point when the species was widely dispersed. As 
noted in the last lecture, one of the key tensions in world history is the 

balance between the local and the connected. A. People were initially spread out in small numbers and inevitably, 
because of environmental conditi
ons and other factors, formed 
intensely local cultures and institutions, setting the stage for the current 

regional aspect of human identity. 
B. About 12,000 years ago (roughly 10,000 to 9000 BCE) there were, at 
most, 5
10 million people in the world. Agriculture was introduced 
into this framework. 
C. Homo sapiens sapiens
 coexisted with other human species, such as the 
Neanderthals, for a long time. It is not known how 
Homo sapiens sapiens
 triumphed over other species, but the process serves to 
illustrate the complexity of the developments that prefigured 

agriculture. III. Let us now turn to the questions of when agriculture was introduced, the 

complexities of its introduction, and 
its implications for the future. 
A. The introduction of agriculture, sometimes called the 
Neolithic 
revolution
, was a crucial change in the human experience. Some would 
argue that, other than the emerge
nce of the species itself, the development of agriculture and th
e later replacement of agricultural 
economies with industrial economies are the two key developments of 

the human experience. 
B. Agriculture was ﬁinventedﬂ in 
at least three separate places. 1. The first invention occurred in the northern Middle East/Black Sea 
region with domestication of wheat and barley.  
2. The second invention occurred in South China and continental 
Southeast Asia around 7000 BCE with the introduction of rice. 
3. The third invention was the domestication of corn, or maize, in 

Central America about 5000 BCE. 
4. Agriculture may also have been 
invented in other places, including sub-Saharan Africa and northern China. 
C. By 5000 BCE, agriculture had gradually spread and was becoming the 

most common economic system for the largest number of people in the 

world. Despite the advantages of agriculture over hunting and 

gathering, its widespread adoption was slow. 
1. One reason for this slow spread was that contacts among relatively 
far-flung populations were minimal.  
2. Not all regions were suitable for agriculture; some were heavily 
forested or arid.  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
10 3. An alternative economic system based on nomadic herding of 
animals prevailed for a long time over agriculture in the Middle 

East, Africa, the Americas, and Central Asia. 
4. Agriculture involves settling down,
 which might not have been 
attractive to some hunting-and-gathering societies that treasured 

their capacity to move around. 
IV. When agriculture was introduced, it brought massive changes in the human 

experience.  A. Agriculture involves more work, particularly for men, than hunting and 
gathering; thus, it redefined and increased the work expectations of 

human society. 
B. Agriculture also redefined gende
r relations. In most hunting-and-
gathering societies, men did the hunting and women did the gathering, 

but because both groups contributed to the food supply, women usually 
had some influence in society. In
 agricultural societies, however, patriarchal systems predominated. 
1. The most obvious reason for the increase in male dominance was 
that agriculture both permitted and required an expansion of the 

birthrate. 
2. Men increasingly assumed the role of principal cultivator of the 

crucial food crops, resulting in the development of patriarchal 

societies. 3. In hunting-and-gathering societies, children had few functions 

until they reached their early teens. In agricultural societies, childhood and work became more cl
osely associated, and the idea of obedience tended to follow this shift. 
V. The advent of agriculture raises 
interesting questions about human 
progress. A. Despite what many of us learned in grade school, the adoption of 
agriculture had a number of drawbacks. In some cases, these 
drawbacks affected some groups™ 
willingness to adopt agriculture. 1. The first drawback is the intr
oduction of new kinds of inequality, particularly between men and women. 
2. The second is that agriculture 
allowed people to settle down into clustered communities, which exposed
 the inhabitants to increased incidences of epidemic disease. 
3. The third is that agricultural societies altered the local environment 
in a way that hunting-and-gathering societies did not do, to the 

extent of damaging and even destroying a regional environment 

and the communities that existed there.  
B. The advantages of agriculture
, however, allowed it to spread. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
111. One not entirely frivolous theory to
 explain this spread is that 
agriculture allowed the growth of products that could be fermented 
to create alcohol. 
2. More systematically, agriculture significantly improved food 
supplies, which in turn allowed families to have more children  

and resulted in population expansion.  
3. These conditions prevailed for a long time, between about 9000 
BCE until 300 to 400 years ago. C. Agricultural economies were constrained by limitations in the amount 
of food that a given worker could generate. Even the most advanced 

agricultural economies required about 80 percent of the population to 

be engaged primarily in agriculture, which limited the amount of 

taxation that could be levied and limited the size of cities to no more 

than 20 percent of the populationŠa crucial feature to remember about 

agricultural societies in general. 
D. Agricultural societies also generated cultural emphases, especially by 
encouraging new attention to the spring season and to divine forces 

responsible for creation. 
E. The crucial features of agriculture were its role in population increase 
and its capacity to generate discerni
ble surpluses, which freed at least some people to do other things, such as manufacturing pottery. As we 

will see in the next lecture, manufacturing could lead to yet additional 

developments in the human experience, including the emergence of 

cities and advancements in 
other areas of technology.  Further Reading: Brian Fagan,

.  Questions to Consider: 1. Why, despite its obvious drawbacks, did agriculture spread so widely? 
What common human problems did it alleviate? At the same time, why 
might many people resist agriculture? 
2. Why did we once assume that hunting 
societies treated women worse than 
more civilized societies did? Why and how, in contrast, did agriculture 

increase the inequality between men and women? Why did women put up 

with this result?

12 Lecture Three  What Is a Civilization?  Scope: After agriculture, the next step in 
setting a framework for world history 
is the emergence of civilization as a form of human organization. This 
is where, in the Western civilization tradition of history surveys, 

history is usually seen as starting. The first human civilization 

developed in Mesopotamia around 3500 BCE. Three or four other 

early, pioneering civilizations can also be identified during the next 

2,000 years. These civilizations, all of them agricultural, generated a 
number of key innovations that have 
not had to be reinvented since. 

Civilizations did not, however, spread uniformly. Furthermore, many 

world historians are uneasy about relying too much on civilization as 
an organizing principle, and although their objections may sometimes 

be a bit too politically correct, they deserve some attention. The 
civilization concept is useful and valid, but only if its limitations are 
also recognized. 
 Outline I. The early civilization period in world history runs roughly from 3500 
BCE1000 BCE.  
A. Civilization first emerged in the Middle East about 5,000 years after 
the advent of agriculture. Before that time, agriculture had permitted 

the development of some isolated 
cities, usually with populations of 10,000 or slightly more.  
B. Nonetheless, it is important to realize that agriculture did not quickly or 
inevitably lead to civilization. Some
 agricultural societies (for example, 
in West Africa) reached the m
odern period without forming the 
apparatus that we associate with civilization.  II. The emergence of civilization in th
e Middle East was preceded by other technological developments in additi
on to the maturing of agriculture. 
A. By around 4000 BCE, people in the Tigris-Euphrates valley (that is, 
Mesopotamia) were beginning to use bronze for weapons and tools. 

They also used the wheel, which had probably been brought to the 

region by nomads in Central Asia.  
B. The use of bronze improved military and production capacities, but it 
also imposed requirements for long-distance trade and travel, another 

feature that marks this ear
ly civilization period.  
C. The first specific civilization to emerge, again in Mesopotamia, was 
Sumeria. It would be followed over 
the next several thousand years by 
a succession of states, including Babylonia and the states of the  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
13Hittites, Assyrians, Chaldeans, and others. The attractions of 
civilization drew migrants and invaders to the region, particularly from 

Central Asia.  
III. Sumeria, the prototype of early civilization, generally offered a number of 
features that agricultural societies without civilization lacked. A. This civilization benefited from surpluses in agricultural production. In 
fact, some historians would define civilizations in general simply as 

agricultural societies that have particularly large surpluses.  
B. Sumerian civilization offered features of human organization not 
present in agricultural economie
s, including a formal political 

apparatus with leadership and 
a certain degree of structure. Civilizations thus are defined as 
stated societies rather than stateless societies.  C. Another feature of civilization was the existence of cities and increased 
dependence on cities. Cities mean concentrations of people that can 

facilitate cultural exchange and technological development. Cities also 
depend on more elaborate trade than ag
ricultural societies, fostering the 
development of a merchant class.  
D. Civilizations, beginning with Sumeria, have writing, which enables 
recordkeeping, is associated with
 bureaucracies, allows long-distance 
communication and the expansion of 
trade, and affects the generation and preservation of knowledge.  
IV. A procession of civilizations developed first in Mesopotamia; some of these 
expanded into empires in the Middle East.  
A. Civilization emerged in Egypt along the Nile from about 3000 BCE.  
B. Harappan civilization (so called becau
se Harappa was one of its major 
cities) originated around 2500 BCE in the northwestern section of the Indian subcontinent in what is now Pakistan, along the Indus River. 
C. A fourth center of civilization developed in Asia along the Yellow 
River, or Huang He, in northern China. 
D. Some historians also point to the first civilization in Central America, 
Olmec, as another ear
ly civilization type. 
E. The fact that most of these early civilizations clustered along river 
valleys was no accident. River valleys provided the most abundant 
opportunities for agriculture and, therefore, the promise of surplus. 
1. To take maximum advantage of river systems, however, required 
the use of irrigation systems which in turn depended on a high 
degree of coordination and, possibly, some property definition. 
2. Use of the river encouraged a situation in which governments and 
formal rules would make sense. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
14 V. Many world historians are uncomfortable with the concept of civilization as 
a vehicle for studying history. 
A. The first objection to this approach stems from the version of the 
civilization story that is sometim
es associated with the Western 
civilization teaching tradition.   1. This version emphasizes the importance of Egypt and 
Mesopotamia as the origin of a 
glorious tradition that would pass to Greece, Rome, and Europe. 
2. This view ignores the fact that 
important early civilizations also 
developed in other places.  3. This view is vital to recognizing that Egyptian and Mesopotamian 
traditions fed not only Greece and Rome
 but also later elements of 
Middle Eastern, East European
, and African civilizations.  B. The second objection to the civilizati
on approach is the fact that much 
of the world, particularly in this early period, did not adopt civilization.  1. Polynesian society, for example, was an agricultural economy that 
had a definite social structure and elements of a state but no 
writing and no particularly vigorous cities.  
2. Civilization did not spread to areas where hunting and gathering or 
nomadism prevailed or to some agricultural societies.  
C. The third objection stems from the distinction between civilization and 
barbarism drawn by civilized peoples. It is quite valid to note that 
civilizations tend to produce people who look down on others. This is 

an interesting human phenomenon, but it is important not to adopt 

those prejudices in looking at civilized and uncivilized peoples.  D. The final concern with the civilizati
on concept is the fact that what we emphasize in civilizations can distor
t aspects of the human experience 
and the kinds of groups that form civilizations.  
1. For example, writing changes the 
operation of states, trade, and 
knowledge-gathering, but until very recently, most people in 
civilizations were illiterate. Writing affects the way society is 

conducted, but it does not describe the majority condition.  
2. We have emphasized cities, but all agricultural civilizations had, at 
most, a fairly small minority of th
e total population living in cities.  E. Civilization, as we saw with agriculture, involves a mixture of 
advantages and disadvantages. 
1. Civilizations, by writing rules and laws, formalize the inequality 
between men and women. 
2. Civilizations usually develop a more extensive social structure 
between the upper classes and the lower classes. 
3. Many civilizations extend the capacity for warfare beyond that 
found in hunting-and-gathering and agricultural societies and, by 
attracting pressures from the outside, may increase both the 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
15importance of military activity and the disadvantages of military 
activity for ordinary people. 
VI. Civilization is, first, a form of hum
an organization, but a second definition of the term involves the emergence and identification of regional 

characteristics.  A. For example, Mesopotamian and 
Egyptian civilizations developed close beside each other geographically. They had trade, military 
contact, and periods of cultural exchange, but the two societies were 
quite different. 
1. The Egyptian emphasis on monuments implies more labor 
organization and different beliefs about death and the afterlife.  
2. Artistic and literary artifacts of the Egyptian culture tend to be 
somewhat more optimistic that those of the Mesopotamians.  
3. At least in the upper classes, Egyptian societies seem to have 
allowed greater leeway for women. 
4. Egyptians did not practice infanticide, as most early civilizations 
did.  
5. These comparisons attest to the extent to which civilizations in this 
second meaning could develop sepa
rate lines of activity, cultural 
definitions, and political institutions. 
B. The comparative emphasis between Egypt and Mesopotamia highlights 
civilization as a regionally cohesive
 force. The same idea applies to 
other early river valley civilizations. 

1. The Harappan civilization seems to have developed elaborate cities 
with highly advanced urban technologies.  
2. Chinese civilization may have 
placed significant emphasis on the 
importance of the ruler and the st
ate, at least in comparison to 
Harappan civilization. 
C. Each of the river valley civilizations had some distinctive features and 
a distinct history, but they all had essential features in common. These 
civilizations all had states, established cities, developed trading patterns 

and a merchant class, and ha
d different kinds of writing 
VII.  All these early civilizations declined
, but what legacies did they leave? 
A. The river valley civilizations left so
cietal mechanisms that would never 
have to be reinvented, including the concept of states, the idea of 

writing, and the use of money. 
B. These early civilizations left a cer
tain geographic dispersion that would 
be important later on. Although they concentrated in river valleys, 

many of the early civilizations had wider influences.  
 1. Egypt, for example, had interactions with sub-Saharan African 
societies along the upper Nile that would ultimately generate their 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
16 own civilizations. Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations spread 
their influence to Greece and Crete. C. The third legacy is the extent to which the spirit of early civilizations 
spread to later societies.  
 1. The Chinese, in their semi-mythical histories of the Shang dynasty, 
implied that the Shang introduced the concept of political order 
that would inform Chinese culture.  
 2. People have argued also that Mesopotamian ideas about the 
separation between humans and nature influenced later Middle 

Eastern and European cultures. VIII. The end of the early civilization period is marked by a hiatus around 
1200Œ800 BCE. 
A. Harappan civilization, for example, simply disappeared. It was 
replaced by a period in which Indo-European invaders and migrants 
poured into India and began to mix with local populations. A new 

civilization phase and a partial relocation occurred as a result.  
B. Egyptian civilization, although it did not disappear, clearly began to 
falter somewhat around 1000 BCE.  
C. The great empires of the Middle East also went through a hiatus in 
which important local societies emer
ged, such as Venetia and Israel. 
D. This interval was amplified by a new series of invasions and migrations 
from Indo-Europeans in Central Asia.  
E. Chinese civilization had the least clear disruption; the Shang dynasty 
flows fairly smoothly into the Zhou dynasty. 
F. With the exception of China, this break in civilization history marks the 
gap between the first civilization period emphasizing river valleys and 
the classical civilization period that we will define in the next lecture.

18 Lecture Four  The Classical Period in World History 
 Scope: Almost all world historians define a period running roughly from 1000 
or 800 BCE to 500 or 600 CE. The period saw great activity and many 

changes, but it takes its basic definition from the rise of three or four 

major civilizations and the unfolding of their key characteristics, 

followed by a fairly dramatic dec
line in each case. These features do not define the whole worldŠkey parts of northern Europe, many parts 

of sub-Saharan Africa, places in Asia (such as Japan), and the 

Americas are left out, though they experienced their own historical 

developments. The largest populations centered in the classical 
societies, and these societies would also have the greatest impact on 
later ages, particularly in their own regions but measurably beyond as 

well. Although the focus remains on ci
vilization, classical societies differed in several ways from thei
r river valley predecessors (whose 
achievements they all built on). They also developed a few mutual 
contacts, a point that must be addressed even as primary attention goes 

to the individual classical centers. The most common way to deal with 
the classical period is to compare 
major developments in each center, 
such as Greece and Rome. But before 
turning to specific results, this lecture addresses a vital preliminary: what the classical civilizations 

had broadly in common, which is the same thing as addressing what 

the classical period as a whole was fundamentally about. 
 Outline I. The classical period in world history runs from about 1000 or 800 BCE to 
500 or 600 CE. 
A. Some of the key formative elem
ents of major civilizationsŠwhat 
historians call the great traditionsŠw
ere forged in the classical period and would be ingredients in world history from this point onward.  
B. The classical civilizations were s
ituated in areas where river valley civilizations had flourished earlier, although they usually relocated 
somewhat and always expanded.  
1. China expanded from the north to the southern portion of the 
Yellow River, forming the Middle Kingdom. 
2. Indian civilization spread through the whole subcontinent, with its 
focus now in the Ganges River basin rather than in the northwest.  
3. Classical Mediterranean civili
zation was located in Greece and along the shoreline of the eastern Mediterranean and ultimately 
spread westward, both in North Africa and southern Europe.

194. The classical civilization that stay
ed closest to its river valley roots 
was Persia, which had its center in the Tigris-Euphrates valley but 
also spread more widely in the Middle East. 
C. The main purpose of this first lecture on the classical period is to 
highlight some of the common issu
es among these four civilizationsŠ

China, India, Persia, and the Mediterranean.  D. We should note two points before we introduce the classical period.  
1. First, the world history appr
oach treats Greece and Rome as 
important classical civiliza
tions, but unlike the Western 
civilization approach, it does not focus solely on these societies. 
2. Second, it is important to remember that the classical world was 
not yet the whole world. Although the classical civilizations would radiate influence to some other societies, some parts of the world 

that would be important later on were essentially untouched by 

classical developments. 
E. Although they all used river valley achievements, these classical 
civilizations expanded significantly from their predecessors. At its 

height, the classical Chinese Empi
re embraced about 54 million people, 
and classical Rome 
had about 52 million. 
II. Let us begin by looking briefly at the individual stories of these 
civilizations in the classical period. A. From the fairly decentralized, of
ten landlord-dominat
ed Zhou dynasty, China made a move to centralization under the Qin dynasty and even 
more centralized political and id
eological operations under the Han dynasty at the end of the period. 
B. Classical Mediterranean civiliza
tion emphasized the Greek tradition 
until the 4
th century. This was followed by the period of Alexander the 
Great™s conquests and the Hellenistic period, in which Greek cultural 

and political influences interacted with the traditions of Egypt and the 

Middle East. In its final phase, the civilization™s emphasis shifted to 

Rome, the republican period and the empire, which became the most 

coherent geographic expression of the classical Mediterranean.  
C. In its heyday in the 6
th and 5th centuries BCE, Persia was far more 
important than Greece and had established a strong, effective 

government. The Persian tradition would be partially overshadowed, 

however, first by the conquests of Alexander, then by the conquests of 

Arab Islam.  
D. Classical India involves the story of the in-migration of Arian or Indo-
European peoples, whose culture was gradually codified into major 

works of literature and religious philosophy. India, in this second civilization period, settled down into more recognizably coherent 
development, with a major empire in the 4
th century BCEŠthe  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
20 Mauryan EmpireŠand, at the end of the classical period, another major 
imperial statementŠthe Gupta Empire.  
III. Comparisons of these civilizations highlight some of the crucial differences 
among the classical traditions as 
they emerged in this period. 
A. Classical China generated Confucianism, the most important 
ideological statement in the East Asian tradition, as well as Daoism. On 

the whole, however, China™s culture was resolutely secular. Of all the 

classical traditions, India was the most spiritual, generating Hinduism, 

Brahmanism, and Buddhism.  
B. The Chinese emphasized empirical sc
ience because of its clear utility to society and the economy. The Gr
eco-Roman scientific tradition, 
particularly in the Greek and Hellenistic periods, was noticeably more 

theoretical. India also had a strong scientific tradition, with an emphasis on the development of mathematics.  
C. Politically, the comparison among the 
societies is also revealing.  1. Ultimately, the Chinese emphasi
s would be on a strong central state and an unusually large bureaucracy. Classical China also 

emphasized key political concepts th
at supported the central state, a specific training system, and at
 least the beginnings of an 
examination system for bureaucrats. 
2. India experienced two interesting imperial periods and some other 
periods when larger political units were formed by invaders. But 

the Indian tradition in this period stressed smaller, decentralized 
states and placed less emphasis on 
political ideology than either classical China or the classical Mediterranean. 
3. The classical Mediterranean ha
d, like China, a strong political emphasis, although its overall political tradition was more 

decentralized than that of China. The Roman state was somewhat 
more interested in the development of legal systems as a political 
unifier, rather than the generation of massive bureaucracies. 
D. Striking social differe
nces arose in India, the Mediterranean, and China. 
1. The Indian caste system was pr
obably the most startling social 
development in the classical pe
riod. Caste obligations replaced political obligations in some instances, which helps explain why 
the Indian political tradition was somewhat less fully developed 

than was the case elsewhere.  2. Mediterranean society was noteworthy for its strong reliance on 
slavery, although slavery also existed in India and China. 
3. Classical China, under Confucianism, developed a social hierarchy 
based on the notion of rule by wise people of the upper class, with 

the lower classes offering deference in return. E. China and India offer interesting economic comparisons. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
211. Classical China depended heavily on trade, but Confucianism 
prompted a cultural bias against merchants, who were viewed with 
suspicion because of their devotion to moneymaking and the 

possibility that they would pull away from the central political and 

social values of Chinese society. 2. India placed the most unamb
iguous emphasis on merchant 
activities. Merchants were encouraged to use the Indian Ocean as an artery for foreign trade. 
F. Finally, comparisons can be made in the area of technology. 
1. In this period and for several periods thereafter, China would be 
the most important source of technological innovation in the 

world. For a long time, a pattern was established by which 

technologies initially introduced in China would gradually percolate westward.  
2. India also had a successful emphasis on technologies, particularly 
steelmaking. 
3. The Mediterranean probably had the least well-developed 
emphasis on production t
echnology, possibly because it tended to expand the slave system rather than increase production through 

technological development.  
IV. This brief overview suggests the 
possibility of using comparison to 
highlight some of the interesting 
differences between these classical societies, but it is not always easy to determine why such different 

emphases emerged.  
A. China may have focused on political
 order because of its geography. The possibility of invasion from Central Asia may have encouraged an 
emphasis on order to ward off disruption, but the threat was not so 

great that establishing political order became impossible.  
B. India was also affected by invasions and influences from the outside 
world that came through the passes that lead through the Himalayas 

and northwestern India. In addition, a hoary historical principle holds 

that India™s emphasis on artistic sensuality and religious fervor could 

have stemmed from its climate. 
C. Whatever the origins of these separate impulses and traditions, they 
would tend to solidify and affect these regions not only during the 

classical period but well beyond. 
V. The classical period gains coherence from two simple developments.  
A. These societies were territorially much larger than their river valley 
predecessors.  1. China expanded geographically 
several times over, while the 
classical Mediterranean coalesced into a unit of its own. The 
Persian Empire was larger than virtually any of its river valley 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
22 predecessors. Indian civilization, in spreading through the south 
continent, embraced a territory va
stly larger, more diverse, and 
more complicated than Harappan civilization had been previously.  
2. Crucial in this expansion was the fact that these civilizations all 
had access to iron technologies, which were introduced from about 
1500 BCE onward. These technologies would serve to underwrite 

more elaborate and effective 
production and an expansion of 
military capacity. 
3. Leaders in these societies also 
saw clear advantages in terms of 
population expansion to enlarge their economic, cultural, and 

political territories.  
4. Further, these societies were now
 comfortable with the apparatus 
of civilization as a form of human organization, which may have 

meant that basic developments could be used in combination with 

new technologies to expand further. 
B. With the partial exception of the Mediterranean, the achievements of 
these classical civilizations represented fairly durable expansions of 
their territories.  
1. In later periods, China would be truncated geographically, but for 
most of world history, China is associated with the territory that 
was established in this period. 
2. The same holds for India if we view India as a cultural unit, not 
simply a political one. The same may hold to some degree for the 

recurrent reassertions of the Persian commission. 
C. Following expansion, all these socie
ties faced the need to develop an apparatus of integration that would 
allow the expanded territories to be 
successfully used and maintained.  
1. In China, the government relocated northern Chinese from the 
Yellow River region into the south to develop population loyalty 
amid the diverse ethnic and linguistic picture of south China.  
2. Rome, in its imperial period, also relocated groups of Roman 
citizens as well as military garrisons to unify its territory.  
VI. The classical civilizations emphasi
zed three basic integrating devices. A. Perhaps the most obvious device was economic integration. All these 
societies traded to some extent beyond their borders, but primarily, 
they focused on economic, communication, and trade patterns that 

would connect the various parts of the expanded territories. 
1. The Chinese promoted regular 
interaction between the wheat-
growing regions of north China and the rice-growing regions of 
south China, creating canals that would facilitate exchange. 
2. Mediterranean rulers and merchants eagerly developed contacts 
with grain-growing regions, such as North Africa and Sicily.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
23B. A second integrating device was culture. In the 6
th and 5th centuries BCE, all these societies introduced key cultural systems: Confucianism 
and Daoism in China, Hinduism and Buddhism in India, 

Zoroastrianism in Persia, and philosophy and art in the Greco-Roman 

world. These cultural systems we
re expanded throughout each empire, 

at least among the elites, to provi
de something of a cultural glue. 
C. The most complicated device was political integration. In all cases, 
there was an effort to take advantage of the territorial expansion of the 
civilization and to build imperial structures that would foster and 
reinforce economic and cultural coherence. Throughout this period, the 

imperial tradition was more of a recurring effort than a consistent one. 
D. The result of integration is seen in achievements that later societies in 
these regions and elsewhere would look back on with awe and 

reverence. Thus, each of the classical traditions outlived its own existence by creating identities, value systems, and institutions for a 

variety of societies that would come later on. 
E. We call this period classical because
 it was both formative and, later, 
revered. We will see institutions, cultural and artistic patterns, and even 

economic and technological values crop up later that hark back to the 

legacy of these societies in this important period in world history.

.  Questions to Consider: 1. Why did the specific features of the 
classical civilizations differ so much? 
Geography clearly played a roleŠthink of the Chinese Middle Kingdom as 
compared to the mountainous terrain 
of Greece which encouraged separate city-states. Climate may also have played a role. But what about earlier 

precedents, such as the Indo-European culture for both the Mediterranean and India, and what about the creativity of individual leaders? 
2. What is similar and different about the way a contemporary educated Indian 
is likely to think about classical India and the way a contemporary educated 

Westerner thinks about the classical Mediterranean?

24 Lecture Five  Cultural Change in the Classical Period  Scope: Creating large and durable cultural systems was one of the hallmarks of 
classical civilizations. Many people experienced significant changes in basic belief systems as the period unfoldedŠnot an everyday 
occurrence in human affairs. Confucianism and Daoism in China 

(along with legalism, which urged tight state control over the people), 

Hinduism and Buddhism in India (plus some smaller religious strains), 

Zoroastrianism in Persia, philosophy and art in the Mediterranean, and 

ultimately, Christianity, increased in importance at the time and have 

remained important since. Cla
ssical belief systems present two 
contradictory images, both quite real. First and most obviously, they 

differed greatly, helping to set up differences among societies that, to 

some degree, persist today. Second, they accomplished some similar 
goals, notably in providing ethics or rules for life and justifications for 
widespread acceptance of one™s lot in life.   Outline I. In this lecture, we look at cultural developments in the classical period, 
focusing on two basic arguments. 
A. First, the factors that reshaped cu
ltures in this period are probably more 
important than other types of changes, such as political changes. 
Cultural developments in each of 
the classical civilizations moved 
some people away from what had b
een cultural staples in the human 
experience up to that point.  
B. Second, the most obvious result of cultural change in the classical 
period was the development of cultural signatures for each of the major 
civilizations. Without question, sharp distinctions emerged and remain 
important to this day; at the same
 time, we will also look at some 
shared features of culture in the classical period. II. Culture, in the sense of basic beliefs, values, and assumptions, is a vital but 
elusive part of the human experience.  
A. Human beings depend heavily on cultu
re because we do not have many 
basic instincts. One reason for the extended childhood of humans is the 
need to imprint cultural elements into the psyche.  
B. By the time of the early river valley civilizations, different cultural 
forms, such as artistic expressions and beliefs about death had 

emerged. For most people, cultural approaches centered on 

fundamental features with local variations.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
251. It is probably fairly natural in the human experience to have strong 
initial beliefs in polytheism and magic. 
2. By the time of the river valley civilizations, another cultural 
element was the idea that the rulers
 of these new civilized states were either directly inspired by gods or were themselves gods.  
3. During the classical period, these staplesŠpolytheism, belief in 
magic, and belief in the divinity of rulersŠwere not overturned, 
but they were modified, as we™ll see later in this lecture.  
III. As we discussed in the previous lect
ure, the classical period was marked by 
the emergence of key cultural figures, mainly in the 6
th and 5th centuries BCE: Confucius and Lao Tzu in China, Zoroaster in Persia, Socrates and 
his philosophical heirs in 5
th- and 4th-century Greece, and Buddha in India.  A. These figures drew on prior traditions
 in the regional culture to create 
coherent and widely appealing statem
ents that helped shape distinct cultural identities in each of the classical areas.  B. Zoroaster, for example, emphasi
zed the importance of the tension 
between supernatural forces of good and of evil.  
C. Chinese culture was particularly shaped by Confucius and Confucius™s 
interpretation of earlier Chinese tradition. In this culture, the emphasis 

was on the importance of political order and hierarchy.  
1. Confucius believed that people 
were fundamentally good and, if 
properly educated, would realize their duties to society as a whole.  2. Classical Chinese culture, however
, was also shaped by Daoism, 
which emphasized the importance of harmony with nature, 
contemplation, and balance.  
D. Indian culture was shaped by the emergence of Hinduism. 
1. Indian religion was initially fashioned by the priestly caste, which 
remained important, but during the classical period, Indian beliefs 

evolved into a more sophisticated and varied religion.  
2. Classical Indian culture was also shaped by Buddhism, which 
shared many beliefs with Hinduism but quarreled with Hinduism™s 

focus on the caste system and its emphasis on priestly rituals and 

detailed observances as the proper path to spiritual development. 
E. Classical Mediterranean civilization did not, until the advent of 
Christianity, produce a major religion. It infused the polytheistic 

religion brought in by Indo-European invaders with literary representations that exploited the gods and goddesses as ethical 

models. It also added, increasingly, an overlay of abstract philosophy, 
including an interest in scientific speculation and the powers of reason.  
IV. The classical period, as it was shaped by individual thinkers and by the 
larger evolution of basic cultural forces, produced distinct cultural 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
26 signatures that would mark major regions, not only at that time but for some 
time to come. 
A. All the classical cultural systems 
were aimed at creating a framework 
for ethical behavior. In India, for example, whether in Hinduism or 
Buddhism, the justification for ethical behavior could be found in the 

spiritual advancement that would result from doing the right thing.  
1. The Hindu ethical concept of 
dharma asserts that those who obey 
their caste obligations in this life will have the opportunity for spiritual advancement in subsequent spheres of existence.  
2. This is a direct use of religious and spiritual motivation to 
underwrite the appropriate ethical code for behavior in this world.  
B. In contrast, Confucianism used a secular justification for ethical 
behavior, which should be a function of appropriate recognition of the individual™s obligations to the larger society. 
C. The basic philosophical tendency in 
classical Greece and, later, Rome 
was that the reasons for ethical behavior should be found in individual 
explorations of ethical imperatives and the relationship between the 

individual and larger social obligationsŠagain, a secular justification.  
V. The most obvious result of the classical cultural systems was to create 
something of a common language for elites.  
A. Elites in China, for example, might individually oscillate between 
interest in Daoism and interest in Confucianism, but both packages 
shaped a common elite cultural experience across classical China. The 

same can be argued for the elite experience in the Mediterranean.  
B. The cultural systems and their elite audience were also reflected in 
predominant artistic forms.  
1. The characteristic restraint and 
spare depictions of nature in 
Chinese art relate to Confucian injunctions for personal restraint 
and emotional control, as well as the Daoist™s interpretation of the 
importance of harmony with nature.  
2. Indian art, perhaps more sensual and vibrant, relates to the Hindu 
sense of the vigor of individual gods and goddesses as 

representations of the larger divine essence.  
3. Classical Mediterranean art, 
with its monumentality and its 
emphasis on balance, correlates closely with some of the 

predominant emphases in Mediterranean culture more generally.  
C. These cultural signatures would be
 widely recognized by elites and would shade over into the most widely disseminated public art to 

constitute something of a cultural package. They provided identity 

within the civilization and some distinctions from outside cultures.  
VI. These variations should not, however
, obscure some key similarities. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
27A. All these evolving cultural systems m
oved, at least to a degree, away from some of the previous staples that had defined river valley 
civilizations and earlier human experience, including polytheism, belief 

in magic, and the divinity or divine inspiration of the ruling class.  
B. Further, all these classical systems were marked by a certain amount of 
diversity.  
C. On the whole, the classical pe
riod was marked by considerable 
tolerance. Classical Mediterranean rulers turned against a few specific cultural strands, including Judaism and Christianity, but primarily 
when these strands seemed incompatible with political loyalty. 
D. These cultural systems were, for the 
most part, not actively missionary.  
1. The one exception in this period is Buddhism.  
2. It seems as if the proponents of these systems were aware that they 
were providing a cultural definition for a civilization, not a 
statement for humanity as a whole. 
E. That said, classical systems inevitably had some influence beyond the 
borders of the major civilizations themselves. Confucianism began to 

have an impact on Korea and Vietnam. Hinduism fanned out with other 

aspects of Indian influence, partic
ularly merchant activity, to locate 
Hindu centers in other parts of Southeast Asia.  
VII.  The most important issue surrounding classical cultural packages is the 
extent to which they gradually reached out toward ordinary people.  A. Their initial cultural emphases focused on helping to shape a common 
set of assumptions for members of the governing elite.  
B. The clearest beneficiaries of cultu
ral systems were members of the 
elite, who had the time and resources to indulge themselves and to 
educate their children in artistic and literary endowments. Ordinary 
people had a less clear stake in the cultura
l package.  1. For example, popular religion in China would continue to reflect a 
belief in a multitude of divine spirits and use symbolism to help 
people protect their homes agains
t adverse spiritual forces.  2. The same was true in the classi
cal Mediterranean, where ordinary people continued to participate in folk religions that were 

undoubtedly polytheistic and had a strong magical content.  
C. Of course, the elite value systems developed in the classical period 
influenced the belief patterns of ordinary people.  
1. Certain Confucian values, for 
example, reached beyond the upper 
class in China to help ordinary people understand their relationship 
with the upper classes and to organize their households. 
2. The penetration of cultural systems in the Mediterranean focused 
on artistic forms.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
28 3. Almost certainly, cultural packag
es spread farthest in India, probably because they were so integrally wrapped up with religious expression. Ordinary people could see in Hinduism or 
Buddhism hope for spiritual advancement. 
VIII. We will close this lecture by reemphasizing the balance between diversity 
and commonality.  
A. Diversity is the more obvious feature of classical systems.  
 1. For example, Chinese people, influenced by Confucianism, would 
have very different reactions to 
basic human experiences than their 
counterparts in the Mediterranean.  
 2. These cultural systems are not 
just abstract but describe 
fundamental reactions to ordina
ry issues in human behavior. 
B. We can also identify commonalities, such as an emphasis on values 
that could be widely shared to provide cultural arguments for 

obedience to the existing social and political order. As a result, 

classical civilizations all generated value systems that would have 

lasting impact on the regions in which they were created and, 

sometimes, well beyond.

w belief systems emanating from the 
intellectual and spiritual leaders of th

significant differences in popular appeal in each case? 
2. Why, except for Buddhism and, at the end of the period, Christianity, were 
the classical belief systems not widely exportable to other societies?

29Lecture Six  Social Inequalities in Classical Societies  Scope: All the major classical civilizations
 not only established great social 
inequalities but also assumed that inequality was inevitable and 
desirable. Confucianism argued th
at both elites and commoners should 

respect and complement each other, 
but the culture urged deference on social inferiors. Greek philosophers such as Aristotle wrote about the 

inevitability of slavery, arguing that it was essential to provide the 

means for the wise eliteŠthe aris
tocracyŠto govern. The Indian caste system, religiously sanctioned in what came to be Hinduism, marked 

people off in terms of occupations and permissible social contacts. 

Similar insistence marked gender relationships, with male superiority 

clearly defined. These systems of inequalityŠrather different from 

what most modern people are comfortable withŠraise questions about 
how much attention ordinary men 
and women should receive for this 
long period in world history. Can we just note their presence and 
marked inferiority and leave it at that? 
 Outline I. In this lecture, we will explore the 
social systems of the classical world, 
mainly in China, India, and the Mediterranean. 
A. Each of these classical civilizations had a distinct social system that 
marked its particular definition of 
social inequality, and each also had a slightly different version of a patriarchal gender system. 
B. The social systems of the classical 
world in general were characterized by a greater acceptance of inequality than we see today and a much 
different cultural framework for inequality overall. 
C.  Such social systems are an important
 aspect of our sense of the past.  
1. Ordinary people have a historical legacy of their own, and they 
matter in terms of the legacy of the larger societies in which they 
existed. Social experiences and structures are relevant to the framework of world history as a whole. 
2. Some historians might argue that
 because they were marginalized, 
ordinary people, perhaps women in particular, should not take up 

too much of our attention. We will look at arguments for why the 

inequalities of these civilizations should be more than simply a 
matter of record. 
II. Each of the classical cultural system
s provided explanations for why social 
inequality was both necessary and justified. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
30 A. The Greek philosophers argued that slavery was essential for the 
conduct of society because only with slavery could sufficient 
production occur to support the upper class.  
B. Confucius put forth a similar argument. A minority of people in the 
upper classes (the gentlemen) would 
be wise and able to govern well; they owed these dispositions to the lower classes.  
C. Hinduism made the social inequality 
statement quite directly: different 
people are in different social layers. Those who act appropriately in the 
current social layer will earn the possibility of spiritual advancement. 
III. None of these systems was designed to justify inequality, but they all did 
so.  A. In contrast to the modern world the classical world, especially the elites 
of the classical world, clearly saw social inequality as essential. 
B. Nonetheless, these social systems we
re not as rigid we might imagine.  
1. The caste system of India, for 
example, seemed inflexible, but 
levels of wealth could vary considerably within a caste. There 
were also subgroups within castes called 
jati
, and one could move 
among these with much greater ease than among castes.  
2. In the Mediterranean slave system, slavery could involve 
extremely harsh working conditions, but more slaves were 

involved in domestic service, tutoring, and even running stores and 

shops.  3. Confucianism urged a distinction between gentlemen and ordinary 
people, but it was possible for a bright peasant boy to gain an 

education and achieve a position in the imperial bureaucracy.  
4. None of these systems was as static in practice as it might seem in 
theory, although mobility among 
classes was not common. 
C. With some exceptions, many social groups, although technically 
unequal, did not have routine daily
 contact with one another.  
1. Peasants, for example, were cer
tainly subject to exactions by 
landlords, but on a day-to-day basis, the landlords were not their 

employers in the modern sense. 
2. Indian historians have argued plausibly that the caste system was 
not characterized by routine interference. If you followed your 

caste obligations and did not try to assume inappropriate 

relationships, you might be left with substantial opportunity to 

observe your own group culture and maintain group contacts. 
IV. The gender systems of classical civilizations were patriarchal.  
A. Many classical societiesŠpar
ticularly China and GreeceŠdepended on quite high rates of female infanticide.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
31B. Just as with the system of social inequality, however, the system of 
gender inequality must be seen th
rough the lens of the individual civilization. All the classical civilizations were patriarchal, but not all 
of them were patriarchal in the same way.  
1. In classical China, where Confuc
ian culture was actively used to 
describe appropriate family relationships, the family was a mirror 
of society; thus, the older father 
in the family was the emperor, and 

women, as a subordinate group, were to be productive and 
deferential. 
2. In India, Hindu legalists debated the question of whether a woman 
who lived up to her obligations in this life would advance to being 
a man in the next life. 
3. In classical Greece, upper-class women were confined to the 
household. Rome was somewhat more lenient; the patriarchal 

strictures there, at least for a few centuries, were probably the least severe. C. How did women tolerate these distinctive gender signatures? 
1. Patriarchy tended to isolate small groups of women in separate 
households, so women didn™t have much opportunity to gather in 

groups and compare notes. 
2. Women were themselves victims of the dominant culture. They 
were told that they were inferior, and many of them internalized 

this notion.  
3. Individual women could be forceful within the patriarchal system. 
Ban Zhao, writer of a manual specifying how women should 

behave in classical China, was herself an educated, upper-class 

woman.  
4. Patriarchal strictures operated with greatest force in the upper 
classes. In the lower classes, inequality was less marked because 

men and women knew that both parties were essential to the 

economic survival of the family.  
D. Two additional points are crucial to the question of how women 
survived the system.  
1. Although women were inferior in the patriarchal system, they were 
not the outright property of men.  
2. In all the patriarchal systems, there was a certain possibility of 
leeway over time.  
V. Why do all these different systems of class and gender matter? 
A. Some scholars have argued that diffe
rent versions of patriarchy could 
produce different male behavior.  
B. The importance of different social systems is even more obvious in the 
area of technology. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
32 1. The technological levels of classical China and the classical 
Mediterranean differed consider
ably. The Mediterranean was known for its civil engineering and construction, while China 
excelled in practical technological innovations in the area of 

production.  
2. These differences may be explained, in part, by differences in 
government or cultures, but the most obvious explanation is that if 

the Chinese wanted to improve productivity, their most obvious 
recourse was to invent a new technological device. When 
landowners in the Mediterranean wanted to improve productivity, 
their most obvious recourse was to acquire more slaves.  
3. The social system helps explain different production arrangements, 
different technological experiences, and, as we will see in the next lecture, different foreign policies. 
C. It is certainly likely that the cl
assical Chinese civilization faced the greatest degree of recurring social protest; the civilization that probably 
faced the least was classical India.  1. Classical China nested social inequality in a Confucian culture that 
insisted that hierarchy had to be leavened by reciprocal benefits. The system of inequality, combined with the cultural system, thus 
produced situations of unrest, in which the peasants thought their 

actions were justified by the value system.  
2. Classical India reinforced the cas
te system with religious rewards 
and sanctions. Because social groups were kept partially separate in the caste system, they did not in
teract as directly as landlords and peasants might in China.  
D. Social cultural systems also matter in terms of the attachments ordinary 
people developed to their societies and social order. 
VI. The legacy of the classical social 
systems was both specific and general.  
A. India still grapples with remnants
 of the caste system, even though it 
has been outlawed for more than half a century. Elements of Confucian 

social thinking still mark the Chinese experience. Slavery systems are 

officially gone, but the influence of classical thinking about slavery 

certainly marked history. Some of the assumptions involved in 

patriarchy, although now eroding, conti
nue to be influential as well. 
B. The larger legacy that we continue to contend with is the extent to 
which inequality was assumed a
nd deeply embedded in economic 
systems, access to literacy
, and political rights.   Further Reading: Peter N. Stearns, Erick Langer, Lily Hwa, Merry E. Wiesner-Hanks, Paul

2. Why did women not rise up in protest against their inequality in all the

34 Lecture Seven  The Roman Empire and Han China  Scope: The several centuries of success for Han China (202 BCEŒ220 CE) and 
the Roman Empire (27 BCEŒ476 
CE) pinpoint possibilities for comparison in the classical period. 
They can also help an American 
audience combine more familiar knowledge, usually about Rome, with 
an appreciation for less familiar classical achievements, as in China. 

Both empires provided relative 
peace over wide areas, organized vigorous internal trading networks, and created immensely potent 

political systems. Elements of their achievementŠRoman law, for 

example, or the Chinese principl
es of bureaucracyŠwould shape world history even to the present day. But the empires were also different, for 
example, in military and expans
ionist outlook and in cultural integration. These differences would affect the ultimate legacy of each 
empire. 
 Outline I. In this lecture, we will compare the Roman Empire and the Han dynasty.  
A. These two societies, for a span of
 several centuries, were remarkably 
similar in some basic achievements.  
B. A focused comparison of these societies provides a greater sense of 
what classical governments did.  
C. Comparing the Roman Empire and the Han dynasty reinforces the idea 
that the world history approach must be balanced.  
D. These empires did not exist throughout the whole classical period, nor 
were they the only significant classical societies.  II. The Han dynasty and the Roman Empire each lasted more than 400 years. 
A. Both empires ruled large masses of 
territory in orderly fashion for a 
considerable period of time; the population levels of the two empires 

were also remarkably similar, w
ith more than 50 million people each. 
B. Both empires had clearly emphasized territorial expansion prior to the 
advent of these regimes.  
C. Both empires strove for economic integration.  
 1. The Han continued the policy of building roads and canal systems 
to link major parts of the empire, which in turn, allowed 

specialization and trade among the major regions.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
35 2. Rome sought to establish granaries in Sicily, North Africa, and 
elsewhere that it could then reach through Mediterranean trade routes.  
D. Both empires worked directly for political integration using slightly 
different mechanisms. In Han Chin
a, several devices combined to 
produce a political structure capable of ruling a vast empire. 
1. The Han dynasty attempted to further Confucian thought as a 
means of inculcating certain values in the elite and, possibly, other 
classes.  2. The emperors continued a tradition of emphasizing their divine or 
semi-divine majesty.  
3. Finally, the Han introduced the fi
rst clear system of bureaucracy, 
in which the central government designated representatives in the 

provinces.  
E. Rome had its own methods of a
ttaining political integration.  1. Many Roman writers, particularly early in the empire, were eager 
to sing the praises of the empe
rors and the imperial system. 
2. Rome developed a somewhat more rudimentary bureaucracy than 
the Chinese, but the Romans placed more emphasis on the legal 

system and the rule of law across the empire.   
3. Rome did not usually assert the divinity of the emperors 
themselves but surpassed the Han in imperial monuments, 

triumphal processions, and emphasis placed on the majesty of the 

emperor. 
F. Both systems also expanded the functions of government, using their 
considerable powers of bureaucracy and taxation to provision major 
cities. Both governments were activel
y engaged in a certain level of economic activity designed to ensure a 
stable social and political order.  III. The differences in these two systems still seem to fall within a context of 
remarkable similarities. 
A. The Chinese regime worked harder at integrating its vast territory than 
the Romans. 
1. The Middle Kingdom in China in the classical period was the 
scene of major ethnic mixing and division, particularly in South 
China. 
2. The regime tackled this head-on by planting large colonies of 
northern Chinese in the south and by encouraging the common use 

of Mandarin at the elite and bureaucratic levels. Some of these 

policies are still conducted in frontier regions by the Chinese regime today. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
36 B. Rome planted colonies of soldiers that could begin to foster the Roman 
lifestyle in remote provinces. These were smaller colonies and not 
intended for population integration. 
1. The Romans encouraged the use of Latin by the upper class, 
although it never managed to erase the predominance of Greek in 
upper-class circles in the eastern Mediterranean.  
2. The Romans emphasized the expansion of Roman citizenship.  
3. Despite these integrating devices, Rome was content to establish 
looser control over most of its provinces and to rely on local 

autonomy. 
C. Both the Roman Empire and Han China underwent significant 
territorial expansion, but China was capable of surviving a cessation of 

expansion and was more willing to deal with borderline territories than 

Rome.  
1. The Han Chinese pushed the boundaries of empire out well 
beyond the Middle Kingdom, but 
when they had reached a sustainable point, they did not feel
 the need to compensate for the 
cessation of expansion.  
2. Rome™s appetites in this regard seemed to have been less clearly 
bounded. One reason for this may be that the Mediterranean value 
system was, quite simply, more militaristic than the Chinese..  
3. The Romans needed additional te
rritory as a means of rewarding 
generals and soldiers.  
4. The Romans needed expansion to provide a continuing supply of 
slaves to the labor system.  
5. Rome more clearly began to dec
line when it reached the point at which expansion became impo
ssible, after about 180 CE. D. Han China was unquestionably the more culturally creative of the two 
empires, while Rome™s literature, art, and architectureŠat least until 

the imperial conversion to Christia
nityŠtended to derive more from 
earlier Greek experience. Classical China was also more creative in the 
area of technologies, particularly production technologies.  
E. Before the Han dynasty, classical China created basic philosophical 
and religious systems in a way that Rome did not.  
1. Neither Han China nor classical Rome developed or sustained 
cultural systems on their own that satisfied the spiritual needs of 
important segments of the population. The Han dynasty™s 

emphasis was on Confucianism, while classical Rome™s emphasis 

was on civic religion.  
2. Both emphases called attention to rituals and themes that would 
bring loyalty to the imperial system, but neither system was 

intensely spiritual.  
3. In Han China, Buddhism began to draw interest in the later stages 
of the dynasty and would surge forward after the dynasty 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
37collapsed. In Rome, increasing numbers of Romans converted to 
Christianity.  
F. Both Rome and China encouraged military activity. The Roman system 
depended on tight military discipline and the careful organization of 

infantry in the Roman legions. The Chinese military was probably best 

known for its approach to military philosophy.  
 1. It is from the Han dynasty that we get the 
Art of War by Sun Tzu, 
one of the great works on military thinking generated by any 

society.  G. The two empires obviously had different origins.  
1. The Han dynasty sprung more directly from earlier dynastic 
activity in classical China, replacing a period of disorder under the 

Zhou dynasty with a focus on the importance of political order. 
2.  Rome™s origins in politics had more to do with the control of 
aristocratic landlords and the importance of a certain democratic 

element in Roman politics, both of which were overridden by the 

institutions of the empire. 
H. Both empires began to fade as the quality of individual emperors 
declined, as the empires faced 
invasions from Central Asia and 
elsewhere and suffered from increasing economic stagnation and from 

disease that reduced overall population levels. 
1. Once the western stronghold of the Roman Empire fell, the empire 
would be remembered and borrowed from by later regimes but 
would never be reconstituted. 
2. The Han dynasty was destroyed but its institutions and 
achievements were revived by later regimes.

dynasty? Why did classical IndiaŠjust
 as successful a society by many 
measurements, including economic prosperityŠnot develop a comparable 
great empire? 
2. It is no secret that Rome would ultimately collapse more completely than 
the political system of Han China, 
which proved to be revivable though without the Han dynasty itself. Were there distinctive features of the Roman 

approach to empire, compared to the Ha
n, that help explain this result?

38 Lecture Eight  The Silk Road; Classical Period Contacts  Scope: There is no question that the classical civilizations focused primarily on 
their own developmentŠon the demanding task of trying to integrate 
unprecedented stretches of territory economically, culturally, and often 
politically. We have noted before that world historians feast on contact. 

It is also true that important 
contacts among classical civilizations 
developed that were significant both at the time and in their 

implications for the future. Trying to understand these contacts and to 

balance their intriguing qualities with their clear limitations provides 

another angle on the main features of the classical period and its 

relationship to later ages. This lecture focuses on two types of contact: 

trade contact and direct juxtaposition between two civilizations. 
 Outline I. Before we begin to discuss contact between civilizations, we should note 
that the classical period is defined by regional history, not local history, and 

by connections that expanded those re
gions systematically and, in some 
cases, durably. We will explore the contact that overlaid these regional 

integrations, while not overshadowing the regional picture. In other words, 

the regional focus remains primary; wider contact is a significant overlay. 
II. Two major types of trade contacts developed during the classical period, the 
most famous of which involved the contacts along the Silk Road.  
A. The Silk Road was a nexus of trade 
routes that ran from western China, 
usually through Central Asia, across the northernmost reaches of the 
Himalayan Mountains, into the Middle East through Persia, and 
sometimes beyond the Middle East and into the Mediterranean. 

Alternative routes took some trade through India. 
1. Trade along the Silk Road took traders into a variety of ethnic 
settings, particularly in Central Asia. It frequently involved direct 
interaction between merchants from established agricultural 

economies and nomadic traders.  
2. As the name implies, the good that was most important on this 
trade route was silk, manufactur
ed in China and increasingly esteemed by people in the Middle East and the Mediterranean.  
3. Flowing along the Silk Road in the other direction were exotic 
animals, gold, slaves, and to a lesser extent, spices and food 

products from points along the more easterly end of the chain.  
B. What was the significance of the Silk Road?  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
391. The increasing taste for silk in th
e Mediterranean is an example of 
the ways in which new patterns 
of trade can feed consumer 
interest.  
2. The trade was economically important for some manufacturing 
centers in western China and, obviously, for the merchants. 
3. In other respects, however, this trade pattern did not have a major 
impact on the economies of any of the major societies involved.  
C. Trade along the Silk Road
 proceeded in stages along the expanse of the Asian continent. Nobody, as far as we know, traveled the length of the 
route from the Mediterranean to China or vice versa. This fact, along 
with the relatively light volume, helps explain why the Silk Road did 
not generate particularly intense cultural or technological exchanges.  
III. A second nexus of trade developed with India as its center. 
A. This network involved trade from the Middle East and the 
Mediterranean going directly to India, as well as Chinese interest in 

direct trade with India.  1. By the time of the Roman Empire, regular expeditions were 
mounted annually from the Red Sea to the subcontinent of India, 
and colonies of Roman merchants operated in some southern 

Indian cities; the key interest here was spices, such as pepper. 
2. The trade was sufficient to motivate some government 
encouragement as well as the desire to acquire better knowledge of 

navigation. We can also assume some direct involvement between 

the Mediterranean and Indian societies. 3. Chinese trade also reached Indi
a, both along the Silk Road and over the sea, from the Pacific coas
t of China to the Indian Ocean and eastern India.  
B. As trade centers, both India and the 
Silk Road remind us that classical 
civilizations did not operate in complete isolation. They increasingly 
learned the advantages of at least limited commercial outreach.  
IV. Some other trade routes developed 
that pressed beyond the boundaries of 
the classical civilizations themselves. 
A. China developed a fairly robust trade with Korea and Vietnam.  
B. India had probably the most extens
ive trade outreach of any of the societies; merchants from southern India, in particular, traded with 
other parts of Southeast Asia, including modern Indonesia.  
C. Mediterranean and Middle Eastern traders developed contacts with 
parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Active trade also connected Ethiopia with 

the Middle East and points in the eastern Mediterranean.  
D. Thus, the classical civilizations, along with their strong emphasis on 
patterns of internal trade and commercial integration and specialization, 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
40 reached out for certain products to a wider network that embraced 
territories beyond the classical civilizations themselves.  
V. The classical period offers our first stories of great interregional travelers.  
A. In this period, for example, the 5
th-century Greek traveler Herodotus 
recorded his stories, revealing an active imagination, curiosity about 
distant places, and tolerance for diverse habits and practices.  
1.  Herodotus also, however, illustrates some of the continuing 
limitations of interregional contacts; he went to Egypt, parts of the 
Middle East, and into the western reaches of Central Asia, but by 

later standards, his travels were a bit modest.  
B. Herodotus and other early travel
ers were willing to mix absolute 
nonsense with solid fact.  
C. At the end of the classical period, a series of Chinese travelers moved 
into Central Asia and India, where they often sought Buddhist 
sanctuary and inspiration.  
VI. A second kind of contact beyond travel and trade emerged through 
encounters between major civilizations. 
A. The first of these was the encounter in the 6
th and early-5th centuries BCE between Greece and Persia. This was an unusual situation, in which two major societies, operating on different cultural and 

institutional bases, had direct territorial and military interaction with 

each other, resulting in mutual 
learning and mutual antagonism. 
B. Alexander the Great™s conquests br
ought Greek civilization into more 
extensive contact with societies and cultures in the Middle East, 
including Persia and northwestern India. Emissaries from Hellenistic 

societies interacted directly with representatives of Indian culture with 
several interesting, although limited, results. 
1. There was an artistic interaction that followed this period of 
Hellenistic-Indian contact and lasted for about 150 years.  
2. There was an exchange of id
eas between Greek and Indian mathematicians.  
3. Alexander™s intrusion into India possibly inspired later Indian 
leaders to begin greater political and imperial activity on their 
own.  4. Possibly fueled by this contact, some Buddhist missionaries were 
sent into the Middle East, where there was some interaction with 

Middle Eastern ethical thought.  
C. A final contact began to take shape from the 2
nd and 3rd centuries CE onward between China and India.  
1. China began to import Buddhism directly from India, along with 
Buddhist artistic styles and literature.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
412. Large numbers of upper-class and ordinary Chinese converted to 
Buddhism. 
3. This contact was mediated by an effort to ensure that Buddhism 
was consistent with the Chinese value system.  
4. Buddhist statements about the value of celibacy and individual 
spiritual quests were recast to make
 this aspect of the belief more 
harmonious with Chinese values.  
5. These religious adjustments illustrate the idea of symbiosis in 
exchanges between civilizations, that is, a combination of the 
imported value system with beliefs and practices from the 
receiving society in a syncretic fashion.  VII.  Despite these patterns of contact, th
e basic ﬁstuffﬂ of classical history continues to be the individual civilizations and the areas immediately 

around them that they could affect through trade and cultural exchanges. 
A. For most of the classical civilizations during most of this period, direct 
borders with other large, organized civilizations were the exception 
rather than the rule.  
1. Greece abutted Persia, and the Ro
man Empire woul
d have contact with Persian kingdoms and war with them, but large stretches of 
the Roman Empire bordered on hunting-and-gathering or early 

agricultural societies, not on highly organized civilizations. 
2. Most of China™s borders, with the exception of Korea and 
Vietnam, similarly involved contacts with nomadic peoples, not 

those of other civilizations; the same applies to much of India.  
B. Classical history remains a history in which contacts are an important 
but secondary story.  
1. These contacts were marginal in terms of the leading economic 
themes in the major regions; they did not generate durable cultural 
influences that touched more than one society and did not develop 
patterns of technological diffusion.  
2. Nonetheless, the exchanges were significant enough that they 
would be remembered even after 
some of the apparatus of the 
classical period fell into disuse.  
C. The Silk Road network, particularly, had depended on effective 
Chinese control of a territory that reached into Central Asia. These routes also depended heavily on the organization of Persia that was 

first achieved in the Persian Empire and then revived by successor 

states. D. As the classical societies began to
 decline, the im
portance of trade opportunities and, possibly, even the promise of cultural exchange 

remained vivid enough that people 
would actively seek replacements. 
E. For this reason, the contact points 
in the classical period are well worth noting. They did not overwhelm the greater dominance of factors

42 operating within the civilizations, but they helped to inaugurate a phase 
in which new types of contact would be pursued and new levels of 

contact would develop in succeeding centuries.  Further Reading: Milo Kearney,

contactsŠdid

 even more interested in contacts 
with one another?

43Lecture Nine  The Decline of the Classical Civilizations  Scope: Strikingly, within a period of about 400 years (from the 2
nd to the 6
th centuries CE) the great classical empires collapsed. If the emphasis of 
the classical period had been on the expansion and integration of large 
territories, clearly, the period was now
 coming to an end. The pattern 
raises vital questions of causation: What forces pushed once-great 

societies into decline? Are we dealing here with a law of history, that 

societies have some kind of common lifespan that pushes them 

ultimately into aging and decay? Th
ese questions must also address 
another vital feature of the period of classical decline, that although 

there were some common processes 
at work, the results were quite 
different from one case to another. 
This differentiation helped set the 
framework for the next period of world history, and it, too, must be 
explained. 
 Outline I. The fall of the Roman Empire, the Han dynasty in China, and slightly later, 
the Gupta Empire in India marks a great divide in human history. 
A. These declines had, if not global, at least Afro-Eurasian dimensions 
involving significant changes in some of the structures that had been 
developed in the classical period. 
B. In looking at the fall of these empires, we should note that they all had 
experienced significant ups and downs in the classical period. 
1. In the Mediterranean, the Greek 
city-states reached an apogee at the end of the 5
th century and then went into a period of decline. 
This was followed by the Hellenistic period, the Roman Republic, 
and the Roman empire. 
2. In Indian history, the fall of the Mauryan Empire was followed by 
a period of regional emphasis, then by the rise of the Guptas.  
3. Chinese classical history had been marked by the decline of the 
Zhou dynasty over a long period. 
4. These earlier oscillations all occurred within a persistent 
framework, so that we can point to change but not to a major 
termination of the period. 
C. In contrast, the fall of the classical empires involved a significant 
alteration in political and, in many cases, economic and cultural 
structures, after which the world would be measurably different. 
D. In this lecture, we will look at thr
ee separate stories, beginning with the Han dynasty.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
44 1. The Han dynasty entered a period of greater weakness toward the 
end of the 2
nd century CE, marked by interruptions in Han rule, 
deteriorating economic conditi
ons, and social unrest.  2. The Hun invasions finally toppled the empire, and it no longer 
existed after 220 CE.  
E. The Roman Empire reached its 
high point around 180 CE, after which it became impossible for Rome to expand further..  
1. Over the course of the 3
rd and 4th centuries and, finally, in the 5
th, the quality of leadership in the empire deteriorated, and the army 
began to intervene more crudely in political affairs. 
2. Rome™s internal trading network began to deteriorate in favor of 
local economic emphases and efforts at self-sufficiency. In turn, 

the central state was unable to collect as much tax revenue as it 

had earlier.  
3. These conditions were followed by a period of invasion, especially 
from Germanic tribes on the northern border of the empire. 
4. The Roman Empire officially ended, at least in the West, around 
476 CE. 
F. The Gupta Empire in India began to deteriorate in the 5
th century.  1. Emperors were unable to cont
rol local rulers, resulting in 
decentralization.  2. In the 6
th century CE, a group of Huns from Central Asia 
dislodged the empire altogether. 
II. These three cases span a period of almost 400 years, from the 3
rd century to 
the 6
th century CE; by the year 600, the classical world was essentially 
gone. To have such similar developments occur this close together suggests 

that we can identify some common pr
ocesses and common results in the 
situations of these three civilizations.  
A. We can easily point to commonalities in the process.  
 1. All three empires found themselves less able to function.  
 2. The qualities of central leadership deteriorated.  
 3. Local political and economic elements
 began to take center stage.   4. Economic performance stagnated.  
 5. In some cases, social unrest increased in response to worsening 
conditions.  
 6. All of this was capped by a series of invasions.  
B. Scholars have generally identified three coincident factors in the fall of 
these empires, the first of which was invasion. 

1. In China and India, the attack
s of the Huns were directly 
responsible for the end of the empires. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
452. In the Roman Empire, the direct 
invaders were for the most part 
Germanic tribes; these tribes were pushed into Roman territory 
partly because of invasions from Central Asia by the Huns.  
C. The second factor was an increased incidence of disease.  
1. These epidemics may have been smallpox or measles, probably 
spread from India.  
2. Both the Roman Empire and China experienced economic and 
social dislocation brought on by massive death.  
3. Labor was difficult to find, and people pulled back from the more 
elaborate production and trade arrangements that had marked the 

empires at their height.  
4. Governments had difficulty collecting taxes. Local landlords 
would compensate for their revenue decline by increasing pressure 

on local populations. 
D. The third causal factor in the decline of these empires involves human 
qualities.  
1. Less talented leaders were a fact
or in the decline of the great empires, especially in Rome.  
2. There was an increased selfishness on the part of elites, who 
became less willing to serve in government or military positions.  
3. The morale of ordinary people may also have deteriorated.  
III. Do successful civilizations inevitably go through periods of infancy, 
maturity, and decline? 

A. This notion of a humanlike pattern of existence for major societies was 
posited by, among others, the British wo
rld historian Arnold Toynbee.  1. Civilizations seem to reach a 
height that they cannot sustain because their bureaucracies become 
more venal, more defensive, 
and less interested in the innovation that created the vitality of the civilization in the first place. 2. The success of the system carries th
e seeds of its own destruction.  
B. Some observers today have wondere
d whether these laws of history 
and the analogy of the fall of the gr
eat classical empires may apply to 
societies today.  C. The idea of laws of history must be modified for the classical period by 
a recognition that the fate of the different civilizations varied from one 
case to another, despite the similarities we have seen so far.  
D. The fall of the Gupta Empire in India, for example, was followed by a 
long period, literally centuries, in which no large empires were created 
in India except as a result of Muslim and, later, British invasion. 
1. The next time an Indian state 
was created by Indians was the Indian democracy in 1947 after the departure of the British.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
46 2. Hinduism and the Indian caste system continued to spread. India™s 
trade activity worsened a bit in
 ensuing centuries, but India 
remained a productive economy.  
3. The fall of the Gupta Empire was a significant change but did not 
mark the decline and fall of the civilization.  
E. The Chinese case involved real so
cial and political dislocation. 1. The fall of the Han dynasty was followed by 350 years in which 
central government institutions di
d not operate. China was divided politically into regional entities, and landlord power increased.  
2. In the sixth century CE, however, the short-lived Sui dynasty was 
established; with it, came a period in which China recovered most 
of the institutions and cultural values of the Han dynasty.  
3. The idea of decline and fall of Chinese civilization would be 
misleading; there was a major interruption, but it did not destroy 

the capacity to reinstate earlier institutions. 
F. The fall-of-civilization image applies 
most accurately to western Rome.  
1. The authority of the state dw
indled, and localized conditions 
prevailed. When the civilization revived, it did not do so literally 

according to Roman dimensions.  
2. In the eastern empire created
 by Constantine, the Roman 
civilization was replaced by the Byzantine Empire, which 
maintained many of the institutions and cultural attributes of 

Rome. 
G. Thus, we do not know from classical history whether the maturity of 
civilizations will result in a massive change in the capacity of social 

institutions or a period of dislocation, followed by revival. Either path 

can be illustrated by events in the classical period. 
H. Instead of asking why we see decline and fall, we should ask why we 
see differential decline and fall. 
1. One factor is that invasions might be more or less severe, as was 
the case with the greater pressure of the Germanic tribes on the 
western part of the Roman Empire.  
2. At the same time, India was proba
bly less affected than China or Rome by new disease patterns. 
3. It is also possible, particularly in the Roman west, that the 
institutions and values of the empire may have been less deep-
seated; thus, the attachment between ordinary people and the 

empire may have been weaker. 
IV. Three durable changes constitute the reason we use the fall of the great 
empires to mark the end of one pe
riod and the beginning of another. 
A. In much of the civilized world, the emphasis on empire diminished. 
Societies were less capable of maintaining large, integrated political 

structures, were less interested in doing so, or both. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
47B. The deterioration of this-worldly conditions inevitably pushed people 
to think about cultural alternatives to the political values that had described the classical period: the end of the classical period and the 
beginning of the next period would be marked by a greater religious 

emphasis. 
C. The changes in the Roman Empire 
resulted in what seems to be a 
permanent division of the Mediterranean world into three entities: 

Western Europe; the northern Middle East/southeastern Europe; and 
the rest of the Mediterranean coast, including North Africa. This 
division marks the next phase of world history and continues to mark 
world history up to the present day.

48 Lecture Ten  The Postclassical Period, 500Œ1450  Scope: World historians increasingly use the neutral term 
postclassical
 for this crucial period; the European term 
Middle Ages or medieval makes little 
sense for the world at large. At first glance, this period can seem 
particularly confusing. Both th
e number and geographical range of 
civilizations increased, leaving us without the convenience of three or 

four focal points, as in the classical period. On reflection, however, we 

can focus on two or three larger themes. First, the period saw the 
spread of the three world religionsŠBuddhism, Christianity, and 

IslamŠwith the latter the most dynamic during this millennium. 

Hundreds of thousands of people, from Ireland to Japan, from Sweden 

to the Swahili coast, changed their basic beliefs. Second, the pace and impact of international trade acceler
ated. The Indian Ocean became the 
key artery for world trade, but it was supplemented by north-south 
routes from Africa and Europe, by increased activity along Asia™s 

Pacific coast, and of course by contacts through the Mediterranean. 

Dramatic innovations in religion and trade, then, set the tone for the 

period. Every society in Afro-Eurasia had to react to these new forces, though their reactions varied. In the process, world history gradually changed from an emphasis on the separate development of key 

societies (divergence) to the in
teraction and frequent deliberate 

imitation among key societies (convergence). The year 1000 CE can be 

taken as the basic dividing line. Developments later in the period, 

particularly the brief but decisive establishment of the Mongol empires, 

enhanced the pattern of convergence. The postclassical period thus not 

only offers coherent focus but constitutes one of the crucial transitions 

in the human past.  
 Outline I. The postclassical period in world history is dated from about 500 CE to 
1450 CE. 
A. This span is one of the periods th
at has been reshaped extensively by work in the field of world history;
 it was once viewed as a somewhat 
confusing stage in human experience.  

1. One reason for this confusion is that the geographical territory 
organized into civilizations in this period expanded greatly, as did 
the number of separate civilizations. 
2. A second explanation stems from the European history term for 
this period, the 
Middle Ages or the 
medieval period
, which somehow implies an awkward, stagnant stretch of experience in 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
49Europe between the grandeur of Greece and Rome and the glories 
of the Renaissance.  
3.  From a world history perspective, the postclassical period was a 
time of great dynamism, with many major innovations and 

extremely vigorous societies. Medieval Europe would be only a 

small part of this larger experience. 
B. In trying to define the postclassical period, we are using a key 
analytical tool of historians, periodization. The introduction of a new 

period in world history means that the framework that had described 

the human experience previously is no longer central. 
C. In introducing a new period in history, we must address three points. 
1. First, we need to prove that th
e themes of the previous period are 
no longer dominant. 
2. Second, we need to say when the new period comes into play and 
when it stops being salient. 
3. Finally, we need to articulate wh
at the new themes are to which 
most major societies will have to react.  
II. The first point in this instance is easily established. 
A. With the fall of the great classical empires, we no longer see the 
processes of expansion in China, India, and the Mediterranean and the 

development of integration devices in these societies to hold their 

expanded territories together.  
B. At the end of the classical peri
od, China and India are essentially established.  
C. We certainly do not see continued expansion and integration in the 
classical Mediterranean because that civilization has burst apart.  III. The second point we must address in introducing a new period relates to 
chronological boundaries.  
A. The beginning of the postclassical period is marked by the fall of Han 
China, Gupta India, and the Roman Empire.  
B. The period also is marked by the emergence of the Arabs and Islam as 
a new force in world history, beginning around 600. In this period, 
Arab-Islamic civilization becomes the 
first world-class civilization that 
we have dealt with in world history thus far.  
C. The end of the postclassical period is described primarily in terms of 
Arab political deterioration but also changes in Arab cultural and 

economic roles. This reduction would be followed by perhaps two 

centuries of experimentation, resulting in some intermediate systems 

that take us up to 1450. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
50 IV. The postclassical period saw the emergence of a larger number of 
civilization centers and a larger geographical range for civilization than had 
been true in the classical period.  A. The Mediterranean world split apart and three related but distinct 
civilizations emerged from the wreck
age of the Roman experiment.  
1. The first of these developed in the Middle East and North Africa, 
which became the heartland of Islam and the Arab world. 
2. The second involved the territories carved by the Byzantine 
Empire in the northeast corner of the Mediterranean and the 
extensions of Byzantine influence into other parts of Eastern 
Europe.  3. The third involved the society that we have come to call Western 
European society.  B. New territories entered the civilization game, including Japan, Russia, 
northwestern Europe, northern Germany, the British Isles, Scandinavia, 
additional parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and the Americas.  
C. The splitting of the Mediterranean world and the geographical 
expansion of civilization brought with them new challenges in defining 

the number of civilizations in our study.  
V. Two themes serve as primary focal
 points for the postclassical period. 
A. The first theme involves the spread of world religions, which showed 
the capacity to pour across political and cultural boundaries without necessarily erasing those boundaries.  
1. These world religionsŠChristianity, Buddhism, and IslamŠ
would push so far into the civilized regions of Afro-Eurasia as to 
touch literally every major society.  
2. The postclassical period is partly defined by the immense surge of 
missionary religions, mainly originating in the Middle East or 
India, but spreading from these places to other parts of Asia, much 
of Africa, and ultimately, almost all of Europe.  
3. This focus on cultural developments helps explain why the 
postclassical period is not defined by overarching political themes. 

Churches, networks of Islamic centers of law and scholarship, and 

Buddhist temples become the focus of activity in this period, 

eclipsing the role of formal states. 
B. The second theme involves the emergence of a ﬁworld network.ﬂ In 
this period, systematic exchanges begin to predominate much of the 

Afro-Eurasian world.  1. During the postclassical period, a basic commercial artery 
emerges, running from the Middle Ea
st across the Indian Ocean to India and Sri Lanka, reaching Southeast Asia, stretching into the Pacific, touching the Philippines, and extending to the Pacific 

coast of China.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
512. This east-west artery was embellished by an elaborate series of 
feeder routes that ran north to southŠlinking China, Africa, 
Scandinavia, and northwestern Europe to the Arab world.  
3. These trading connections were sustained by new technologies, , 
new navigational devices, 
and improved map making. 
VI. One other mechanism useful for interpreting this period is a categorization 
of the new and old centers of civilization into one of three economic and 

contact zones based on their relations
hip to new patterns of interregional 
trade. A. The first of these zones is focu
sed on the Arab world, the Byzantine Empire, India, and China. In the language of today, this zone would be 
the developed worldŠthe areas that built most clearly on the 

achievements of the classical civilizations.  
1. These areas had the most sophisticated manufacturing systems, the 
largest cities, the most sophisticated, opulent upper-class and 
artistic styles of life, and the most elaborate political structures.  
2. These areas traded ac
tively with and influenced one another.  
B. Around these centers emerged a host of
 societies in which civilization was a relatively new form of human organizationŠincluding Japan, 

parts of Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Russia, and northwestern 

Europe.  1. These societies forged tradi
ng connections with the more 
developed regions.  
 2. Deliberate imitation enabled these second-tier societies to develop 
cultural and economic apparatuses more quickly than they would 

have otherwise. 
C. A third significant region of civilized experience, which we™ll discuss 
in later lectures, also developed in this period but had no effective 
contact with either of the first two zones.  
VII.  The two major themes of this period raise some final points.  
A. The spread of world religions involved new kinds of contact, rivalry, 
and suspicions that would become durable parts of the world history 
environment.  
B. At the same time, many world historians would claim that the new 
trade connections and the resulting contacts and imitation possibilities 

deserved even greater emphasis. 
C. One world historian has said that around the year 1000 CE, the human 
experience reached a crucial divide.  1. Before that time, the bulk of 
human experience was shaped by 
local and regional factors, with the focus more on separate factors 
instead of shared ones.  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
52 2. After 1000 CE the balance shifts, with a focus on convergence 
rather than divergence. From that 
point to the present, one sees a pattern of interaction, a thirst for contact, and a willingness to imitate that transcend the divisions and local identities that had 
been emphasized earlier. 
D. We can see the importance of new levels of contact, but the 
concomitant development of new re
ligious loyalties sets up an obvious dilemma; religions established new cultural boundaries that could 
modify or challenge the commercial connections 
E. In sum, one emerges from the postclassical world with a sense of new 
contact and interaction but also with the potential for new rivalries. 
These divisions would shape the wo
rld of the postclassical centuries and the world after that as well.  Further Reading: Janet Abu-Lughod,

53Lecture Eleven  World Religions and Their Consequences  Scope: Although two of the three world religions originated earlierŠin the 
case of Buddhism, much earlierŠthe postclassical period saw the 
crucial geographical expansion of 
Buddhism and Christianity, as well 
as the origins and expansion of Islam. Conditions of the late classical 

period help explain the new religious impetus. By 1450, with a few 

exceptions, the religious map of Europe, North Africa, and Asia was 

set in terms that survive today. 
Christianity had yet to reach the Philippines and Korea, of course, a
nd Islam™s penetration of Indonesia 
was just beginning, but otherwise durable changes had already 
occurred. Expansion was accompanie
d by compromises with existing 
belief systems. Nevertheless, enough cultural change occurred that not 

only religious life but also economic activity, social relationships, 
politics, and artistic and broader intellectual efforts were deeply 

affected.  Outline I. As noted in the last lecture, the spread of religion was one of the two great 
themes of the postclassical period. 
A. This was the period in which much of the contemporary religious map 
of Africa, Europe, and Asia was forged. 
B. This spread of religion would have common results in areas as diverse 
as gender relations, law, and art. 
C. We will try to remain value-neutral 
as we look at religion, but we may 
encounter some pitfalls, particularly in justifying the selection of 
Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam as world religions.  
 1. In the postclassical period and af
ter, each of these religions has shown the capacity to persua
de people beyond conventional 
political boundaries and cultural zones that it represents the truth.  D. Identifying these three faiths as world religions does not mean that they 
are the ﬁbestﬂ religions; many other religions were and are important in 

world history. When we say that these three world religions took 

geographical shape and exerted mu
ch of their influence in the postclassical period, we are not denigrating other major faiths.   
II. From a historical standpoint, three factors caused the spread of world 
religions. 
A. The first of these is context. Although Buddhism, Christianity, and 
Islam began at different chronological points, their takeoff periods 
related to the collapse of empires in the later classical period. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
54 1. As economic levels deteriorated
, political instability grew, and the population saw new levels of dis
ease and death, people looked for 
institutions to compensate for the decline of the state institutions.  
2. This situation offered a compelling framework within which 
missionary religions could take hold.  
B. The second factor involves the quality
 of missionary activity, which in 
all three cases, was often correlated with expanding merchant activity.  
1. Merchants, through their commercial success, as well as their 
geographical outreach, helped bring religion to new areas.  2. Missionaries, as they sought to convert new souls, frequently 
established a framework for new commercial activity. 
C. The third factor involves the extent to which one or more of the world 
religions could seem associated 
with other aspects of success.  1. In all three religions, individual rulers adopted the faith not just for 
themselves but for their subjects. In the process, they used the 
religion to cement loyalty between the people and the state.  
2. Religion might also be associ
ated with commercial success. 
Converting to a particular faith offered the opportunity to trade 

with new sources of wealth.  
III. The chief change with these ne
w religions was a replacement of 
polytheism. People stopped believing in
 the old sets of gods and goddesses 
and started believing in one of the more unifying, more abstract, religious 

sources. A. This process of conversion involved compromise. All the world 
religions, formally or informally, made some bargains with polytheism. 
B. They might, for example, build new religious institutions where old 
temples had been or incorporate hints of the old gods and goddesses in 
rituals of veneration for other holy figures.  
C. These adjustments come under the name 
syncretism, that is, the extent 
to which in accepting new beliefs people hold onto remnants of the old. 
IV. Buddhism, as it fanned out from India, took two major directions, with a 
third at least briefly noteworthy. 
A. Buddhism began to lose ground to Hinduism in India proper. Many 
Indian rulers saw in Hinduism 
clearer support for military and 
commercial activity, and they distrusted the abstract quality of 
Buddhism.  
B. As Buddhism faded in India, however, it gained ground elsewhere. It 
spread to Southeast Asia and, at the end of the early postclassical period, to China and, through China, to Korea and Japan.  
1. The Chinese embraced Buddhism, 
with the stipulation that Buddhism adapt to Chinese modes of thought.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
552. Buddhism would also exercise an impact on other Chinese belief 
systems, such as Daoism.  
3. The Tang dynasty in the first part of the postclassical period 
ultimately turned against Buddhi
sm on the grounds that Buddhists 
were unreliable allies of the state and too foreign to Chinese 

values.  
C. The spread of Buddhism to other parts of East Asia was less qualified 
and would exert a longer-term influence than the spread in China. 

There was a Buddhist surge into Central Asia and, belatedly, into 
Tibet.  D. Buddhism showed an impressive cap
acity to adapt to local conditions and to tolerate and merge with other aspects of the local religious 
scene. V. The story of the spread of Christianity may be somewhat more familiar.  
A. Christianity fanned out widely in the Roman Empire after the death of 
Christ, largely based on missionary activity. This spread involved not 

only the European parts of the empire but also Armenia, North Africa, 

parts of the Middle East, Persia, and other parts of Asia. 
B. The Emperor Constantine™
s decision early in the 4th century to tolerate 
Christianity represented a significant opportunity for Christian 

advance. By the end of the century, Christianity was a state religion. 
C. Christian expansion after the fall of Rome took two main paths.  
1. In Eastern Europe and the northern Middle East, the Byzantine 
Empire sponsored orthodox missionaries who went northward into 

East-Central and Eastern Europe.  
2. Western missionary activity fanned out to Britain, Germany, 
Scandinavia, and Poland. 
VI. During the postclassical period, Islam 
reached larger territories and more 
peoples than either of the other two missionary religions. 
A. Islam spread rather quickly among Arabs and some others in the 
Middle East and North Africa. It also spread widely in India and 
Central Asia.  
B. Toward the end of the postclassical period, Islam began to make major 
inroads in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, which is now the 

largest Muslim nation in the world. Islam also had success in parts of 

southern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa.  
VII.  What were the differences in these three world religions? 
A. Unlike Christianity and Islam, Buddhism was not clearly a religion of 
the book. It had a less well defined relationship to state authorities  and was more hostile to things of this world.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
56 B. At the same time, Christianity and Islam differed on the nature of the 
divinity, how salvation could be 
obtained, how religion should be 
organized, and degrees of tolerance.  
C. Thus, the spread of world religions introduced a new differentiating 
factor into world history in Afro-EurasiaŠa differentiating factor 
whose ramifications continue to apply to the present day.  
VIII. These religions also had some common effects that help describe larger 
processes of change during the postclassical period and beyond. 
A. The spread of world religions 
increasingly set the framework for 
artistic and philosophical activity.  
1. These religions defined the leadi
ng artistic and architectural work in much of Asia, Africa, and Europe. 
2. Much work was devoted to questions about how older 
philosophical systems and scientific discoveries fit with the new 
sense of religious truth. 
B. Particularly for Islam and Christianity, the religions also reshaped the 
framework for law, dividing it between secular and religious activities; 

the notion that law was a state matter was jettisoned as the religions 

developed bodies of legal work and commanded jurisprudence. 
C. All three religions raised new questions for the state itself: If these 
religions carried primary truth, what was the role of the state? Should 

the state be reshaped mainly to defend religion? Was there some way 

to separate political and religious areas of activity? What was the 

relationship between religious and political authority? 
D. The rise of world religions might seem to introduce a new tension 
between value systems and trade.  
1. If the main purpose of existence was otherworldly, too much 
attachment to material objects and motivations would be wrong.  
2. Nonetheless, the world religions also, in their own ways, 
encouraged trade.  E. Each of the world religions also 
carried an important social messageŠ
although, again, a complicated one. 

1. On the one hand, the religions all posited the fundamental spiritual 
equality of all believers; on the other hand, they argued that social 
inequality and poverty would always be facts in this world.  2. The main point of religious life was not to fight the social system 
because that would distract from otherworldly goals. 
3. The world religions modified 
the casual acceptance of inequality that described the classical period, but none of the religions 

crusaded against social inequality.  
F. The same bifurcation applies to gender. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
571. Each of the three world religions
 clearly specified that women had 
souls alongside men, and each 
provided new opportunities for women in religious vocations. 
2. Nonetheless, the world religions also sustained and even, in some 
cases, increased the institutions of patriarchy.  
3. During this same period, new institutions arose that coexisted with 
the religions and extended women™s inequality (for example, foot 
binding in China and 
sati in India).  G. The world religions also faced a 
choice between hostility and tolerance toward other religions.  
1. There are certainly examples of 
new levels of intolerance. For 
example, Chinese authorities att
acked Buddhism, while Christians 
and Muslims clashed during the Crusades and the Christian 
Reconquest of Spain.  
2. There are also surprising islands of mutual toleration in the 
postclassical period. For example, many parts of the Middle East 

saw significant Christian and Jewish communities remain, even as 

Islam spread. Muslim Spain to
lerated, even encouraged, interactions among the three basic religious faiths.  
3. The choice of tolerance or intolerance was not fully addressed in 
the postclassical period, though new questions were raised.

58 Lecture Twelve 
 The Impact of Islam  Scope: The spread of Islam broadly fits within the larger patterns of expanding 
world religions. Islam and the Arab society involved with it, however, 
clearly gained a particular importance and power position during the 

postclassical period. The religion had 
special impact as a result, some 
of which would continue long after the postclassical period ended. 

Further, Islam is so hotly debated today that some special attention is 

warranted from that angle. Unlike the other two world religions in this 

period, Islam interacted with literally all the civilizations in Afro-

Eurasia during the postclassical centuries. Its implications for trade, 
politics, and social relationships were similarly far-reaching. Islamic 
society also experienced important 
changes in its Middle Eastern/North 

African heartland, adding to the complexities of its role in postclassical 
world history. 
 Outline I. The rise of the Arabs and Islam was clearly one of the most important 
developments during the postclassical period. 
A. The surge of the Arabs from their or
iginal homeland in southern Arabia 
into much of the rest of the 
Middle East and across North Africa 
created a new civilization zone that remains influential to this day.  
B. An Islamic religious zone was established that ran from Morocco in 
Spain across the Middle East through India, on to Indonesia, and even 
to the southern Philippines. This zone also spread south into Africa. 
C. Even for those regions that did not directly convert to Islam, the power 
of the Arabs and their religion inevitably compelled attention. 
1. China, for example, encountered the Arabs and Islam in its 
western provinces.  
2. Russia, although not in this period Islamic, was also quite aware of 
the importance of Islam. 
3. Western Europe encountered Islam directly as the Islamic 
invasions poured into Spain and parts of Sicily. 
II. In discussing Islam, we must address some of the complexities associated 
with it. 

A. In the contemporary world, Isla
m encounters biases because of 
participation of some Muslims in terrorism.  
B. Further, Westerners have, for a long period of time, harbored 
prejudices against Islam that have led to outdated and exaggerated 
perceptions.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
59C. Islam covers vast territories and 
encompasses many variations beyond 
the Shiite-Sunni split. III. We begin our discussion with the complicated relationship of the Arab 
military and commercial surge after 600 and the simultaneous Arab 
conversion to Islam.  
A. In the power vacuum left in the Mediterranean world after the fall of 
the Roman Empire, Arab leaders saw an opportunity to expand their 
military efforts, seize new territories, and gain wealth and political 
power. Their advance would help spread Islam. 
B. Most scholars now agree that this Arab surge should be read as largely 
an interest in new opportunities rather than a sign of Islam™s spur to 
conquest and conversion. Nonethele
ss, as the Arab world expanded, 
Islam grew with it. 
C. The spread of Islam during the postclassical period was wide-ranging. 
1. Islam™s extension into India primarily involved efforts by 
missionaries and merchants, but Arab and Muslim armies 
periodically poured into India during the period.  
2. Islam also penetrated Central Asia, often displacing Buddhism in 
the process.  3. In sub-Saharan Africa, a mixed Arab-African Islamic community 
developed along the Indian Ocean coast. In the West African 
kingdoms, such as Ghana and Mali, Islam became a significant 

minority faith, mainly among the upper classes. 
4. Finally, of course, Islam gradually spread to Southeast Asia, both 
to the continent and to the islands of present-day Indonesia, where 

it would ultimately gain a substantial hold.  
IV. Why was the Islamic religion so successful? 
A. Islam developed clear codes of
 conduct that outlined the major 
obligations one could fulfill to gain religious reward in the afterlife. 
B. Islam also gained ground simply b
ecause of the example of Arab and 
Muslim commercial, political, and military success. 
C. An interesting combination of tolerance and inducement may also have 
prompted some conversions in the postclassical period. 
1. Jews and Christians were, in principle, people of the book. But 
Jews and Christians were also subject to distinctive taxation 
policies. This framework offered some fiscal and political reasons 

to convert.  
2. Relatively few people were forced to convert to Islam. A 
framework of political activity in
 which non-Muslims experienced 
inequalities, however, could be influential.  
D. Certain social groups might be motivated to convert to Islam.

60  1. Merchants would find that Islam was the most tolerant of 
commercial activity. 
 2. Poor people could see in Islam a statement of spiritual equality and 
an opportunity for access to charity.  V. Complexities in the spr
ead of Islam involve the famous split that occurred 
relatively soon after Muhammad™s death between 
Shiites
, who were attached to a son-in-law of Muhammad as caliph, and the majority 
Sunnis
, who held to a different selection procedure for caliph. 
A. This rift, based on other patterns of
 religious interpretation also, began 
early and continues to define the Muslim world. 
B. The emergence of Sufism created another kind of tension between an 
emotional version of Islam and a more rational approach.  
C. Muslims in the postclassical world, particularly Muslim cultural 
figures, faced some tensions between
 the injunctions of the faith and the rich artistic and intellectual heritage of the Middle East.  
1. In the Arab world, Muhammad™s injunction against artistic 
representation of animal or human figures (as potential sources of 
idolatry) was largely upheld, but the Persian artistic tradition continued its earlier experience with human and animal 

representation.  
2. Islamic attitudes toward music were complicated: the Middle East 
developed a vigorous musical tradition, although the religion 

advised against the use of music because of its potential as a 

distraction from purer spirituality.  
3. Much philosophical effort was devoted to the relationship between 
Islamic faith and rational science and philosophy; building on 

Greek and Hellenistic traditions, the Arab world generated 
important scientific and medical discoveries, but there was also the 
question of how much truth could be gained by reason alone. 
VI. The role of the state in Islam was crucial. 
A. Islam had a clear model of an ideal ruler, who would uphold the laws 
and obligations of the religion and use the state to advance Islam. 

Despite this belief, the Arab caliphateŠthe rule that was established 

after MuhammadŠwas rarely inspired primarily by religion.  
B. Like Christianity, but perhaps a bit more forcefully, the Koran urged 
that even when the state was inappropriately organized or unjust, loyal 

Muslims should not become embroile
d in political disputes because 
doing so would distract from one™s religious obligations.  There was 

the possibility, however, that Muslims might periodically measure the 

state against the expectations of religious purpose and find it wanting.  
C. One crucial difference between Islam and Christianity is that 
Christianity was born outside the state.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
611. Persecution of Christians in the Roman state was sporadic but 
present for more than three centuries.  
2. Because of Muhammad™s position as
 political and religious leader and the subsequent traditions that shaped the caliphate, Islam was 
born in association with the state and could be seen more clearly as 
an instrument of politics. 
3. At the same time, Islam was also 
forced to develop a structure that would allow it to endure even amid state indifference and, at times, 

hostility: centers of Islamic scholarship and law were organized, 
which sustained and provided coherence to the religion.  
VII.  Islam had important social implications that specifically illustrate some of 
the larger points about world religions in society, particularly with regard to 
slavery and issues of gender. 
A. Middle Eastern society had a significant number of slaves, yet Islam 
was not entirely comfortable with slav
ery, particularly when the slaves were themselves Muslim or had converted to Islam. 

1. Although Islam tolerated slavery, it also provided some 
protections, particularly for Muslim slaves. 
2. This was an area of ambivalence in which issues of belief clashed 
with social reality in ways that were not entirely tidy.  
B. Muhammad unquestionably believed that he was improving the 
conditions of women as he spread the religion among the Arabs. 
Several injunctions are particularly noteworthy. 
1. The Koran specifically inveighs against female infanticide; indeed, 
the spread of the world religions generally reduced infanticide 
throughout much of the Afro-Eurasian landmass. 
2. Women were given clear legal rights in Islam, including property 
rights, divorce rights, and access to worship and travel. 3. Nonetheless, Islam did not provide equality for women. Further, in 
the Middle East, Islam became ove
rlaid with the acceptance of other regional traditions, notably, the practice of veiling. 
VIII. Arab society declined in some measurable ways by the 13
th century.  A. The caliphate became less effective. 
Various territories in North Africa and Spain peeled off, even aside from the Christian attack on Islam in 
Spain. The rich philosophical and artistic discussions that had occurred 

earlier tended to narrow in favor of greater insistence on religion alone.  
B. The Arab role in politics declined as more minority peoples, including 
Turks, were incorporated into political life. The Arab role in 

international trade was increasingly disputed. 
C. This decline, however, did not 
mean the erasure of Arab-Islamic 
culture or institutions.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
62 1. The caliphate fell in the 13
th century, but Arab society more 
generally maintained a great deal of vitality. 
2. Because of the earlier vitality of 
the Arabs and Islam, this decline 
marks an important transition toward the end of the postclassical 
period as a whole.

69Glossary  absolutism: Concept of government developed during the rise of nation-states 
in Western Europe in the 17
th century. Absolutism featured monarchs who 
passed laws without parliaments, appointed professionalized armies and 

bureaucracies, established state churches, and imposed state economic policies. 
American exceptionalism: The idea that the United States, though emerging 
from a Western European background, de
veloped novel institutions and cultural forms that constitute an exception to the European model. 

apartheid
: Policy of strict racial segregation imposed in South Africa to permit 
the continued political and economic dominance of whites. 
caliphate: The political and religious successor to Muhammad. 
caste system: Rigid system of social classification first introduced into the 
Indian subcontinent by Aryans. 
caudillismo
: A common form of authoritarian rule in 19
th- and 20th-century Latin America. 
Colombian exchange: Biological and ecological exchange that took place following the Spanish establishment of colonies in the New World. As the 
peoples of Europe and Africa came to 
the New World, animals, plants, and 
diseases of the two hemispheres were transferred. 
consumerism: The pattern of regular acquisition and the assumption that life 
can be measured in part by s
hopping and acquiring (which accompany 
consumer society in many parts of the world). Usually joined by new marketing 
forms such as the department store. 
demographic transition
: Shift to low birth rate, low infant death rate, and a 
stable population; first emerged in Western Europe and the United States in the 

late-19
th century. dharma: The caste position and career determined by a person™s birth. Hindu 
culture required the acceptance of one™s social position and optimal 

performance of one™s occupation in order to
 have a better situation in the next 

life. divine kingship: From the postclassical period onward, many African kings 
claimed that they were divine and surrounded themselves with appropriate 
ritual, though most of them also negotiated with other groups in their kingdoms. 
encomienda: Early landed estate systems in Spanish America; based on grants 
of Indian labor. 
Enlightenment: Intellectual movement centered in France during the 18
th century. The Enlightenment featured scie
ntific advancements, application of 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
70 scientific methods to the study of human society, and the belief that rational 
laws could describe social behavior. 
feminism: This movement sought various legal and economic gains for women, 
including equal access to professions and higher education. The movement 
came to concentrate on the right to vote and won support particularly from 
middle-class women. Feminism was active 
in Western Europe at the end of the 
19th century and revived in light of other issues in the 1960s.  
feudalism: The social organization created by exchanging grants of land or fiefs 
in return for formal oaths of allegiance and promises of loyal service. Feudalism 

was typical of the Zhou dynasty and the European Middle Ages. Greater lords 

provided protection and aid to lesser lords in return for military service. 
fundamentalism: The belief that religion should go back to original doctrines 
and ethical standards. Fundamentalist movements emerged in most major 
religions in the later-20
th century, often associated with growing intolerance of 
other beliefs. Fundamentalists often 
used new communication devices and 
sometimes added new ideas to old ones. 
glasnost
: Policy of openness or political liberation in the Soviet Union put 
forward by Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s. 
globalization
: The increasing interconnectedness of all parts of the world, 
particularly in communication and commerce but also in culture and politics. 
hacienda: Rural estates in Spanish America producing agricultural products for 
markets; based on exploited peasant labor. 
Harappa: Along with Mohenjodaro, the major urban complex of the Harappan 
civilization. It was laid out on a planned grid pattern. 
Homo sapiens sapiens
: The humanoid species that emerged as most successful 
at the end of the Paleolithic period. 
import substitution: Typical of Latin American economies during the 20
th century. This change involved the increase in domestic production of goods that 
had previously been imported, and led to light industrialization. 
Industrial Revolution: A series of changes in the economies of Western 
nations between 1740 and the 20
th century. The Industrial Revolution was 
stimulated by rapid population growth, increases in agricultural productivity, the 
commercial revolution of the 17
th century, and the development of new means 
of transportation. In essence, industrialization involved technological change 

and the application of machines to the process of production. 
international NGOs
: Nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, began to form 
international networks in the late-19
th century around anti-slavery and other 
movements. They proliferated from the 1960s onward, concerned with such 
issues as human rights, environmentalism, labor conditions, and women™s rights. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
71Marxism: Marxism emphasized the revolutionary potential of the industrial 
working class, which would overthrow capitalism, presumably through violent 
revolution, and institute a classless, free society. Labor movements in many 

parts of the world emphasized Marxism from the 1840s into the later-20
th century. Meiji period
: The reform period that began in Japan in 1868, with rapid 
changes in politics and in economic and social conditions. 
Meiji means 
ﬁenlightened.ﬂ 
Middle Kingdom: The territory in China that follows the Yellow and Yangtze 
rivers, usually politically united and forming the core of Chinese society from 

the later classical period onward. modernization
: The idea that societies around the world would move in similar 
directions to replace traditional structures with industrial economies, modern 
states, mass education, science, and ot
her features, and the idea that these various changes would be connected. The theory is often criticized as being 
oversimple and unduly Western in focus. 
Mughals
: Dynasty established by Babur in India in 1526; the name is taken 
from the supposed Mongol descent of Babur
, but there is little indication of any Mongol influence in the dynasty. The regime became weak after the rule of 
Aurangzeb in the first decades of the 18th century. Neolithic revolution
: The succession of technological innovations and changes 
in human organization that led to the development of agriculture. 

new nations theory: The idea that many nations, 
when they cast off colonial rule, have characteristic problems of establishing legitimacy, maintaining 
internal unity and external boundaries, and dealing with new economic 

relationships. Government instability and/or authoritarian rule often result. 
nomads: Cattle-, camel-, or sheep-herdi
ng societies normally found on the 
fringes of civilized societies; commonly re
ferred to as ﬁbarbarianﬂ by civilized societies.  
Opium Wars: Fought between the British and Qing China beginning in 1839 to protect British trade in opium. The wars resulted in a resounding British victory 
and the opening of Hong Kong as a British port of trade. Ottomans: Turkish-speaking people who lived in the vast Ottoman Empire, a 
small part of which is now modern-day Turkey. The Ottoman Empire, founded 
on Islamic traditions, was one of the most powerful civilizations in the modern 

era until its dissolution in 1918.  Pacific Rim: The region that includes Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong 
Kong, and Taiwan. It is typified by ra
pid growth rates, expanding exports, and 
industrialization; either Chinese or strongly influenced by Confucian values; 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
72 considerable reliance on government pl
anning and direction; and limitation on 
dissent and instability. 
periodization
: The device historians use to identify coherent patterns of change 
over time: A period begins when new dominant features are introduced, such as 

political independence after the American Revolution. A period ends when these 

features, though possibly still in play, are replaced by others in predominantly 
shaping the phenomenon, society, or societies in question. 
Reformation: The challenge to the Catholic Church and religious unity in 
Western Europe that began with Lutheranism in the early-16
th century. The Reformation provoked Catholic change, as 
well, and led to broader changes in 
European politics, economics, and family life. 

Renaissance: The cultural and political movement in Western Europe that 
began in Italy circa 1400. The Renaissance was based on urban vitality and expanding commerce and featured literature and art with distinctly more secular 
priorities than those of the Middle Ages. 
Safavids: People of the Safavid, an Iranian dynasty (1502Œ1736) that 
established Shi™a Islam as the official
 state religion. Safavids, a Turkish-
speaking people, were descendents of a Shiite Sufi order. As a rather aggressive 

group, Safavids sought to advance their empire through military means. 
Scientific Revolution
: Culminating in the 17
th century, a period of empirical 
advances associated with the developmen
t of wider theoretical generalizations. 
The revolution resulted in changes in the traditional beliefs of the Middle Ages. 
Shiite: The vital minority movement that began in Islam over disputes as to who 
should succeed Muhammad as ruler. Shiites 
typically believe that theirs is a purer form of Islam and, at various times, have clashed with the Sunni majority. 

shogunate: The partially centralized feudal government that emerged in Japan 
at several points, most notably the Tokugawa shogunate that began early in the 
17th century. Shoguns were the effective rulers in this system, even though 
emperors were officially revered, as well. 
Silk Road
: The most famous of the trading routes established by pastoral 
nomads connecting the European, Indian, and Chinese civilizations. Goods and 
ideas were transmitted among civ
ilizations along the Silk Road. Sufism: Mystics within Islam; responsible for the expansion of Islam to 
southeastern Asia and other regions. 
Sunni: A political and theological division within Islam. 
Zoroastrianism
: An animist religion that saw material existence as a battle 
between the forces of good and evil and stressed the importance of moral 
choice. In Zoroastrianism, the righteous
 lived on after death in the ﬁHouse of Song.ﬂ It was the chief religion of the Persian Empire.

1A Brief History of the World 
 Scope: This course presents some of the highlights of the world historical approach to 
the past, suggesting major changes in the framework of the human experience, 

from the rise of agriculture 
to the present day. The lectures cover the emergence 
of distinct major societies as they deal with common problems but generate 

quite different institutional and cultural approaches. The course also discusses 

key changes in belief systemsŠthe emer
gence and spread of the great world religions, for exampleŠas well as alterations in trading patterns and basic shifts 

in technology, exploring why some societies reacted
 differently to technological change than others.  
Throughout the course, we will look at many
 parts of the world, including those clustered into shared civilizations. East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and 
the Mediterranean loom large from the 
start. Sub-Saharan Africa, where the human species originated, has also played
 a great role in world history, as 
ultimately did northern Europe, including Russia. The Americas offer an 

important variant until their incorpora
tion in global patterns from 1492 onward. 
Central Asia maintained a distinct position in world history until the 16
th century. World history divides into a limited number of time periods, defined in terms of 
dominant themes. The rise of agriculture requires a discussion of pre-

agricultural patterns. Following agriculture came, in several places, the advent 
of civilization as a form of human organization. The classical period in world 

history draws attention to China, India, Persia, and the Mediterranean, when the 

expansion and integration of these large societies dominated over a millennium 

of human history. The collapse of the classical empires ushered in a vital 

postclassical period, when emphasis shifted to religion but also to more 

ambitious patterns of interregional trade. It was in this postclassical period 
(500Œ1500 CE) that the emphasis of major societies shifted from separate 
development to greater interaction a
nd even deliberate imitation. The early 
modern period highlights a renewed capacity for empire, the inclusion of the 

Americas in global systems, andŠthough this must be handled with a bit of 

careŠthe rise of Western Europe. What some historians call the Long 19
th CenturyŠ1750 or so to 1914Šwas dominated by Western industrialization and 

its economic, military, and cultural impact 
on, literally, the entire world. Finally, the contemporary period in world history, after World War I, features a 

bewildering variety of themes that must be sorted out, with emphasis among 

other things on the relative decline of the West, the huge surge in human 

population, and the potential for greater globalization.

2 contacts. The discipline emphasizes a number of key time periods (though not 
an indefinite number), defined in terms of basic changes in the ways many 

societies operated, whether the change is in an economic systemŠ

industrialization, for exampleŠor a cultural system, as seen, for example, in the 

emergence of vigorous missionary religions. 
World history also embraces two common 
themes. First, and most obviously, is 
the eternal tension between change and continuityŠthe stuff of history as a 
discipline. Particularly once the classical traditions are defined, world history 
can be seen in terms of new forces being met and interpreted by established 

cultural and institutional systems. Of course, these systems change but never 

completely and never in exactly the same ways from one society to the next. 
The second theme involves a perpetual interplay between local or regional 
identities, on the one hand, and the attraction or simple inevitability of wider 

contacts, on the other. Societies began trading at long distances several 

millennia ago. They received immigrants
 and diseases and, sometimes, ideas 
from distant places. But they rarely, at 
least willingly, simply surrendered to 
outside influence, and sometimes they battled fiercely against such influence in 

the name of established values. Over time, of course, and particularly with 

contemporary globalization, the pendulum shifted toward more outside 

influence, either willingly embraced or endured of necessity. But the tension has 
not ended, and assertions of regional identities can intensify precisely because the external framework is so intrusive. 
World history allows us to trace the main 
iterations of this tension and to place its current iteration in contextŠand even, tentatively, to talk about its future.

3Lecture Thirteen  Postclassical Trade and Contacts  Scope: The increase of interregional trade in
 the postclassical centuries created and reflected a number of changes.
 An unprecedented range of areas became involved in what we now ca
ll international trade. While still 
focused heavily on luxury products, the amount and variety of trade 
changed as well, and new consumer tastes emerged. Trade brought 

other changes, for example, in shipping technology, mapping, and new 

opportunities for travelers. New contacts promoted missionary 
religions but also exchanges of technologies and other systems. It is 

possible to interpret this surge as the basis for the steady acceleration of trade activities that would ultimately produce globalization. 
 Outline I. The new range and intensity of contacts was, along with the spread of 
world religions, a crucial development in the postclassical period, affecting 

most of Asia and many parts of Africa and Europe. In this lecture, we will 

look at the emergence of world travelers as a byproduct of these new 

patterns of contact, along with the major routes and consequences of 

contact. II. In the 14
th century, one of the greatest world travelers was Ibn Battuta.  
A. Battuta was born in Morocco in nor
thwestern Africa to a middle-class 
merchant family. He launched his trav
els with a pilgrimage to Mecca.  
B. In his lifetime, Battuta™s travel
s would take him to Mecca and other 
parts of North Africa, the Middle East, Persia, Central Asia, India, 

island groups in the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, China, and sub-
Saharan Africa.  C. Battuta™s accounts of his travels both reflected and encouraged the new 
range of geographical contact that was then possible.  
D. He was motivated to travel by his religious faith, his desire for sexual 
encounters, and a massive curi
osity about different places. E. In addition to illustrating the potential for geographical expression of 
human curiosity, Battuta™s accounts reflect other noteworthy features.  
1. He judged his destinations by th
e standards of Islam. He praised 
religious piety but deplored departures from the norm.  
2. In his one clear venture well outside Islam, his visit to China, 
Battuta praised Chinese society and cities, but was disoriented 
without the presence of an Islamic overlay.

4 III. Another great traveler of the postclassical period was Marco Polo, the 
Venetian who presumably went to China under Mongol rule and reported 
on what he found there. 
A. We are not sure that Marco Polo actually went to China. His uncles 
visited China, and he may have used their accounts, along with Persian 
travel literature, to fabricate a version of his own travels. 
B. If Marco Polo did not travel to China, other Europeans clearly did, 
sometimes returning via the Indian 
Ocean and thus encountering South, Southeast, and East Asia. 
C. The European travelers differed fro
m Ibn Battuta in one respect: they 
were less uncomfortable in settings outside their religious orbit. 
D. Combining the cases of Ibn Battuta and Marco Polo (or Polo™s uncles), 
we get a sense of the extent to which people visited distant places. By their accounts, these travelers spurred others to seek new trade and 

contact opportunities.  E. Travel in this period differed greatly from what had been possible in 
the earlier classical era. The travelers went farther and encountered far 

more different situations, and their accounts are much more 

consistently accurate than earlier ones. These changes reflect a different world.  IV. Let us now turn to the patterns of contact. 
A. The core route for the new pattern
 of contact that emerged in the 
postclassical period was an Indian Ocean route connecting western Asia or the Middle East with South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the 

Pacific coast of China.  1. This series of routes was initially forged by Arab merchants 
primarily, but they were soon joined by Muslims and others from 
India, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere, and by a number of Persians.  
2. These routes carried a variety of goods. Particularly important 
were manufactured goods from China, such as silk and porcelain, 
and spices from Southeast Asia or India.  
3. This Asian-centered trade pattern spurred major manufacturing 
expansions, particularly in China. Some historians have even 

referred to a Chinese industrial revolution during the Song 

dynasty, which opened in the later-10
th century.  B. Other routes fed into 
the east-west contact.  1. Two routes connected sub-Saharan 
Africa to this east-west trade, 
carrying African goods into the Middle East, North Africa, and 

other parts of Asia.  
2. Another feeder route developed from Scandinavia through what is 
now western Russia and Ukraine, passing through Kievan Rus on 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
5its way to the Byzantine Empire and then connecting with Arab 
trade.  3. Western Europe also eventually connected with this trade route as 
merchants from England, the Low Countries, and France traveled 

over land or along the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean, the 

Middle East, and beyond. 
V. A number of important consequences can be seen from these trading 
patterns. 
A. This level of interregional trade had a significant impact on internal 
economies, particularly the economy of China. Some areas of the 
worldŠagain particularly ChinaŠbegan to orient part of their 

economic activity toward production for what we would call world 

markets.  
B. New kinds of consumer depende
nce developed as well. Certain 
elements of the upper classes in a number of societies developed tastes 

for goods that could be supplied only from distant regions. 
1. As West Europeans, particularly noblemen, participated in the 
Crusades, they learned of the higher living standards common in 
Middle Eastern cities and developed a taste for that lifestyle. 
2. Postclassical Europeans found that they preferred sugar to honey 
and sought to acquire access to regular supplies of sugar. 3. This kind of consumer attachment spurred shipping activities in 
the Mediterranean that would link Europe to Middle Eastern ports 

where products could be transshipped from elsewhere in Asia. 
4. Not all societies were equally susceptible to consumer needs. 
China, for example, needed far fewer products from the outside 

world than did Western Europe.  
C. Another important consequence invol
ves new levels of culture contact. 
1. A large number of words began to pass into European languages 
from Arabic, denoting the products (such as oranges or sugar) that 

were being transshipped from other parts of the world to Europe. 
2. Other kinds of cultural exchange were even more important, 
particularly the widespread adoption of what Europeans called the 

Arabic numbering system. 
3. Mathematical systems spread 
widely. Algebra (another Arabic 
word) and Arabic mathematical innovation began to spread from 

the Arab world to other societies, including Europe.  
D. Technologies were affected by new levels of world trade in two ways: 
new trading activities encouraged the development of new 

technologies, and increased trade accelerated the transmission of 
technological inventions.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
6 1.  The Arabs introduced developments in sailing ships, and, toward 
the end of the postclassical period, the Chinese introduced gigantic 

oceangoing vessels (junks). 
2. The compass was probably invented in China, but its use spread.  
3. The Arabs learned about paper in
 their military interactions in 
Western China; Western Europeans learned about paper from 

contact with the Arabs. E. An important consequence of new trade patterns was the growing 
utility that societies in Asia, Africa, and Europe found in maintaining 
or increasing their commitment to international activities.  
VI. The postclassical period was a watershed in world history as interregional 
connections developed and solidified by 1000 CE onward. 
A. Many societies in Afro-Eurasia 
turned from an emphasis on largely 
separate developments with conn
ections to other regions to an 
increasing focus on the benefits of connections, the possibilities of 
imitation, and the possibilities of diffusion.  
B. There is a fairly straight line from the interregional connections that 
developed in the postclassical period to what we now view as 

globalization. 
1. Of course, contemporary globali
zation involves far more rapid 
interactions and a greater volume of trade connections and far 
more extensive cultural interactions.  
2. Still, people who traded, traveled
, and wrote travel accounts in the postclassical period inspired others who would extend 

interregional trading activities still further.  
3. Some historians argue that an evolutionary approach to the issue of 
globalization is misguided. Globalization, in their eyes, is a much 
newer phenomenon. 
4. Nonetheless, the postclassical explosion of trade and travel looms 
large in world history.

8 Lecture Fourteen  Postclassical Patterns of Imitation  Scope: Many societies in which the apparatus of civilization was fairly new 
used the opportunity provided by contacts with neighboring older 
societies to copy aspects of culture, technology, and social structure. 

This is a further illustration of the importance of the new interregional 

network, though the imitations were on a regional rather than a global 

level. Japan, Russia, and Western Europe provide examples of the 

process, which includes other cases, su
ch as Vietnam and Korea in East 

Asia and the Southeast Asian importation of religious and artistic forms 

from India, China, and later the Middle East. Imitation helps provide 

some common themes and compara
tive opportunities for the otherwise diffuse process of civilization expansion. It also raises questions, 

however, about civilization definition: Was Japan part of a larger, 
Chinese-dominated East Asian civilization, or did it remain so different 

from China that it should be handled separately? How is Russia to be 

treated in relation to other parts of Christian Europe? Finally, the 

process of imitation did not extend well to politics, where attempts to 

copy larger government models largely failed in favor of more 

decentralized systems. Here, t
oo, is a common dynamic among the 
imitative societies, though a somewhat negative one. 
 Outline I. In this lecture, we will look at pa
tterns of imitation in Japan, Russia, 
Southeast Asia, and briefly, Western Europe during the postclassical 

period. In the process, we will touch on a number of key themes. 
A. First, we will continue with the theme of interregional contacts, but in 
these cases, the distances are smalle
r than those we saw in the last 
lecture. B. We will also see the continuing spread of civilization.  
C. Finally, we will see that these regions were different in terms of 
cultural systems, religions, political systems, and trade patterns, but we 
will also note a common process of
 increasing convergence in which societies deliberately undertook activities that would bring them closer 
to adjacent, more prosperous soci
eties without fully merging with 
them.  
II. Early in the postclassical period and continuing for at least a century, Japan 
organized expeditions to China in search of trade and knowledge. The 
Japanese came to imitate China in an impressive range of sectors.  
A. The Japanese learned new agricultural and manufacturing techniques 
from the Chinese that spurred development of the Japanese economy. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
9B. Japan also took up much of the culture and cultural apparatus of China, 
including its writing system, basic verse styles, martial arts, the art of 
gardening, and Buddhism; with Buddhism came architectural forms 

such as the pagoda and temple.  
C. Chinese social ideas were adopted in Japan to a limited extent. 
1. The prestige of merchants declined slightly in Japan. 
2. The Japanese did not import the full range of Chinese thought 
about gender relations, but they did learn from the Chinese that 
women were less equal to men than the Japanese had previously 
believed.  
D. Japan adopted something of China™s 
superior attitude toward the wider world.  E. One reason that the Japanese did not attempt a larger expansion effort 
in this period may be that their horizons were limited by the idea that 

they had nothing to learn from 
places other than China.  III. Trade ran through western Russia and the Ukraine during the postclassical 
period, connecting Russia with the Byzantine Empire. 
A. Russians traveled to Constantinopl
e for political missions and cultural 
exchange, and Byzantine emissari
es were active in Russia.  B. The Russians got their writing system and religion from the Byzantine 
Empire. 
C. Along with religion and writing came a larger cultural apparatus 
conditioned by the extent to which Russia was a less prosperous, less 
sophisticated society than Byzantium. Byzantine architectural styles 

were imitated, along with the 
Byzantine tradition of iconography. D. From the Byzantines, Russi
an leaders incorporated at least some sense 
of political horizons. A kind of historical chain was believed to link 

Rome to Byzantium to Russia.  
IV. Japan and Russia exhibited similarities 
in the basic process of adoption and adaptation. A. In each instance, people in the imitating society believed that there was 
a positive advantage in visiting and copying aspects of the adjacent, 
more prosperous society.  
B. This process raises a question that is crucial for the postclassical 
period: now that civilization is expanding and societies are deliberately 

imitating each other, how do we
 define a civilization? 
1. In the Japanese case, Japan imitated China, but it did not become 
Chinese.  2. The efficiency of identifying an
 East Asian civilization zone 
probably outweighs the drawbacks, but the label is clearly an 

oversimplification. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
10  3. We can view Russia as a partial 
heir to a Byzantin
e/East European tradition that distinguishes it from Western Europe; thus, we have 
two major civilization zones in Europe: the West and the East-

Central East. 
V. In the postclassical period, a number of regional kingdoms emerged in 
Southeast Asia. At the same time, th
is region received significant cultural and commercial influence from other sources, notably, India. 
A. Indian traders sometimes brought Hinduism into this region, and the 
spread of Buddhism from India was even more striking. From India 
also came inspiration for regional writing systems. 
B. Chinese influence is seen here, par
ticularly in the form of increasing 
trade activity from the time of the Song dynasty onward. 
C. By the end of the postclassical period, Islam had gained the greatest 
religious success in many parts of this region.  
D. This pattern of varying outside influences combined with local 
traditions sets up a different model in Southeast Asia from that seen in 

Japan and Russia. 
VI. Western Europe did not have the same needs that Japan and Russia did 
from its influences, but West European
 leaders saw clear advantages in imitating certain aspects of the Byzan
tine Empire and the Arab world.  
A. Western Europe used these contacts to regain knowledge of classical 
learning that had been preserved 
by the Byzantines and Arabs.  B. From the Muslims and the Byzantines
, Western Europeans also copied 
a variety of technologies and benefited from Arab advances in 

medicine, mathematics, and other fields. 
C. The Arab philosophical debate over the boundaries between faith and 
reason was transmitted to Europe, where it was applied to Christian 

interests in rationalism. 
D. The Gothic archŠthat quintessential artistic symbol of postclassical 
Western EuropeŠwas, in part, adap
ted from the characteristic Islamic 
arch.  E. Western Europe borrowed from Islamic innovations in commercial 
law, identifying principles that could transcend political boundaries and protect merchants regardless of specific location. 
F. Whether acknowledged or not, the Western European debt to Islamic 
and Byzantine examples was consider
able. The fact that this period was one of extensive imitation is an important addition to our 

understanding of postclassical Western Europe. 
VII.  The imitation process raises one final question for the period itself and 
carries some interesting implications for more contemporary situations.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
11A. In all four cases, cultural forms and styles, along with technologies, 
seem to have been particularly eagerly sought. Why is this so?  
B. One fact that prompts this question is the lack of success with the 
imitation of political forms.  
1. Japan, Russia, and Western Europe were aware that political 
models existed that were superi
or to their own decentralized situations. As Japan began to imitate China, for example, it 
exhibited a deliberate desire to import the Chinese imperial 

system.  
2. For almost a century, the Chines
e example was incorporated into 
Japanese political activity, but the effort failed because Japan could not sustain the same degree of centralization as China. 
3. The Japanese solution, during the bulk of the postclassical period, 
would be a form of feudalism.  
C. Russian leaders were aware of Byzantine political examples, but they 
did not wield the same power and could not establish a tightly 

organized political system.  
D. The Western Europeans had a chance 
to establish a more centralized 
political structure under Charlemagne in the early-9
th century.  1. Charlemagne™s realm extended to northern Italy, very northern 
Spain, France, the Low Countries, and parts of western Germany.  
2. Charlemagne, however, lacked th
e resources and, possibly, the 
experience to set up an independent bureaucracy.  
3. Charlemagne ended up reinforcing Western European feudalism. 
E. We see here societies that are cap
able of imitating models to speed up 
artistic, literary, and cultural development, but are the imitators 

inherently less able to use political examples?  
1. Is a period of cultural gestati
on necessary before a society can imitate another society™s political achievements, and if so, does 
this characteristic still apply in the world today?  
2. We have a number of instances today in which societies seek or 
are told to seek political inspiration from 
countries that have different political experience. Are such models particularly 

difficult to follow, or is the political delay we have noted confined 

to the postclassical period?  
VIII. The postclassical period saw a great 
deal of deliberate imitation and a 
substantial degree of success in this arena. 
A. Connections were forged between 
societies that were new to the 
civilization phenomenon a
nd those in which civilization patterns were better established, but these connections never completely erased issues 

of definition between such civilizations as Russia and Byzantium or 

Japan and China. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
12 B. In three of the major casesŠJapan
, Russia, and Western EuropeŠthe 
societies involved were on the peripheries of the most sophisticated 
patterns available during the postclassi
cal period. These three societies would use this period of imitation as gestation for a later, stronger, 

emergence in world history.

13Lecture Fifteen  Western Civilization in World Context  Scope: Western civilization is arguably a mo
re elusive concept than Chinese, 
Indian, or Middle Eastern civilization. World history, including the 
comparative approach, raises interesting issues about identifying 

Western civilization. The postclassical period allows some of these 

issues to be sorted out, though the process must begin earlier. The 

tradition of teaching Western civilization reflected several factors: an 

imperialist-style belief that the West was possibly the only superior 

civilization; a concomitant concern, born in the ashes of World War I, 

that the West was falling apart and needed historical shoring up; and a 

belief on the American side that emphasis on Western values would 

help integrate a diverse and suspect pool of immigrants. Thus Western 

civilization advocates tended to argue
 that there was a straight line from the earliest great civilizations to the glories of Western Europe 

later on. Beginning Western civilization with the river valleys, 

however, raises two questions: First, what was Western about them? 

And second, how can we account for the greater legacy of the river valleys to later East European and Middle Eastern societies? Should 

the Western tradition, then, be traced
 to the classical Mediterranean? 
This is certainly possible, though there is much about classical Greece 
and Rome that does not seem particularly Western; the societies 

themselves (particularly Greece) te
nded to look eastward. The first indisputably Western civilization, in fact, emerged in Western Europe 

during the postclassical period. It had several features that have 

survived, and it was, as we have seen, a somewhat underdeveloped 

borrower during the period. But by the later postclassical period, it was 

possible to identify a Western civ
ilization and compare it with the 
Asian and African cases.  Outline I. We will focus primarily on two questions with a bearing on the West as 
part of the postclassical world. 
A. First, when can an identifiable Western tradition be identified and what 
does that tradition consist of?  
B. Second, how do we situate the West in the postclassical world?  
 1. We have already begun this process by looking at Western Europe 
as one of several imitating societies with some distinctive twists.  
 2. We will add some factors relating to particular patterns of Western 
trade and dynamism toward the end of the postclassical period. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
14 C. It is impossible to teach a full 
Western civilization program in the 
framework of world histor
y; thus we will look at a more subtle issue 
involving the Western civilization tr
adition, namely, the extent to 
which the West is sometimes viewed almost unanalytically.  
II. We can begin by situating the West 
among certain other definitional issues 
previously evoked. 
A. It is harder to pinpoint the origins and characteristics of Western 
tradition than of Chinese or Indian tradition. 
B. One problem in looking at the cla
ssical Mediterranean tradition as the origin of the West is the extent to which this tradition fed not only the 
West but also a number of other societies, including Eastern Europe 

and the Arab world.  1. This fact makes it difficult to extract exactly what is Western in 
this tradition. 
2. The same thing holds true in the great debate between rationalism 
and faith.  
C. Another problem in overemphasizing the classical origins of a Western 
tradition involves how much of the 
classical tradition did not survive or, at least, did not survive in any direct sense. 
1. Classical Greek and Roman attitudes toward homosexuality did 
not form part of the West™s later tradition.  
2. The democratic strand in the 
classical Mediterranean was not predominant, and its link to the revival of democratic ideas in the 
late-17
th and 18th centuries is almost nonexistent. 
3. We cannot deny, however, that some aspects of the classical past 
would survive or be revived to form part of the Western self-

perception.  
D. Some common aspects of Christianity raise questions about the 
boundary lines between the West and the larger Christian world, but 

defining the West as a civilization is not as problematic as defining 

Japanese or Russian civilizations
. We™re skating here between two 
levels of definitional difficulty: the West seems harder to define as a 

civilization tradition than India or 
China but easier than certain cases where imitation was even more rampant.  
III. An argument can be made that the 
postclassical period is where we find 
some distinctive features
 that become demonstrably and durably Western. 
A. The West was defined by Roman Catholic Christianity, where we find 
some of its organizational features.  
1. The Western tradition of Christianity posited a certain degree of 
separation between the religious tradition and political structures. 
2. Although these distinctions could 
be blurred, this separation is 
different from the East European Christian tradition and Islam. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
15B. The Western form of feudalism ultimately developed a pre-modern 
parliamentary tradition.  
1. Feudalism was taken to mean that rulers had some obligation to 
consult with their vassals in making certain crucial decisions, 
particularly where taxation and budgets were involved.  
2. This Western parliamentary tradition appears in Spain, England, 
and elsewhere by the 13th century and becomes a durable part of 
Western political structures. 
C. A third feature involves the po
litical power and independence of Western merchants in the postclassical period. The West was not the 

world™s commercial or capitalist leader in the postclassical period, but 

Western merchants were less constrained by political regulation in 

interregional trade than 
was the case elsewhere. D. Some authorities on Western Europe in this period have argued that 
through Christianity, the West developed a sense of the superiority of 

man over nature that resulted in a special interest in new technologies. 
E. Scholars have posed an interesting argument about a distinctive kind of 
Western family structure that w
ould emerge at the end of the 
postclassical period and intensify in the centuries thereafter. In this 

structure, ordinary people married fairly late, replacing extended family 

traditions with nuclear families. 
F. Are we well served in looking at the postclassical period as a formative 
one for Western civilization? 
1. This period is one in which some classical traditions were 
incorporated or reused and in which some activities developed as a 
result of the imitation of other societies. 
2. In this period, a set of specifically Western themes emerged in a 
few crucial areas of political, social, and economic relationships 
that we can trace from this point onward.  
IV. Another aspect of the task of positioning the West in the postclassical 
period involves, again, the process of imitation.  
A. In relation to other societies operating in the postclassical period, the 
West was rather backward. Western civilization did not command great 
respect in the Islamic world. 
B. Many Western leaders in various spheres of activity felt this gap as 
well, which is why they proved such eager imitators. Westerners 

frequently traveled to Muslim Spain, the Byzantine Empire, and Egypt 

and were filled with awe at the standards of living they encountered.  C. This gap also explains why the Crusades had their primary impact on 
the West: the revelation of the difference in living standards between 

the West and the Middle East spurred new levels of Western trade and 

consumption. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
16 D. The Crusades also highlighted the paradox of the West™s firm 
conviction that it possessed essential religious truth but, in virtually 
every other respect, was a some
what backward society.  V. The West participated actively in postclassical trade, and this trade 
increased as Western society gained vigor, particularly from about 900 or 

1000 CE onward. But as the West entered increasingly into interregional 

trade patterns, it did so with two distinct disadvantages. 
A. Some of the goods that were most sought after in the West inevitably 
depended on Islamic middlemen.  

1. Western traders had to go to Egypt or the eastern Mediterranean to 
obtain goods from India, China, or the Middle East, which meant 
an additional price to pay to a series of middlemen.  
2. These middlemen were emissaries 
of a religion that was viewed as heretical and inferior to Christianity. 
B. The larger problem, however, was 
a balance-of-payments issue.  
1. The West wanted spices, silks, and other goods from Asia, but 
Western manufacturing offered almost nothing to world trade.  
2. When Vasco da Gama reached India, he brought with him Western 
textiles and crude metal products that the Indians were not 

interested in because their products were much better.  
C. Europe existed in the postclassical 
world as an increasingly eager but disadvantaged participant in larger Afro-Eurasian patterns. One 

response was to become enthusiastic imitators of technological and 

other developments.  
VI. Toward the end of the postclassical period, certain occurrences began to 
create new opportunities for the West. 
A. Regional competitors encountered
 new difficulties. The Byzantine Empire declined, and Arab political unities were shattered. These 
developments presented new oppor
tunities to borrow technologies from other societies that could help the West overcome its 
disadvantages.  
1. From China, at the end of the postclassical period, the West 
adopted a number of technologies, including the compass and 
explosive powder.  
2. The printing press, initially invented in Korea and China, was 
brought to Western Europe and put to use by a variety of 

inventors. 
B. Western political capacities began to improve in the last centuries of 
the postclassical era with the emergence of feudal monarchies.

technological developments that
 had military applications.

tinely assume that changes in the 
West in the postclassical centuries were the crucial determinants of 
later Western activity in the world as a whole. World historians, 

however, take a slightly more 
cautious view: new opportunities for imitation and the results in terms of a new world role came first and 

inspired internal changes in the West that would amplify the Western 

tradition.

18 Lecture Sixteen  The Mongol Years  Scope: World history between the early-13
th and the mid-14
th centuries was dominated by the conquests of the Mongols. The Mongols, a nomadic 
people from Central Asia, began a conquest of China early in the 13
th century. Within a few decades, an
 interlocking network of Mongol empires, or 
khanates
, stretched from China in the east to western 
Russia, embracing a significant part of the Middle East and pressing 

into Southeast Asia, while organizing much of the Mongol heartland in 

Central Asia. Mongols were regarded
 as bloodthirsty conquerors; they 

could make cruel examples of ci
vilian populations who tried to hold out against their attacks. But this bad press also reflected the resentments of conquered peoples such as the Russians and Chinese. 
World history has rehabilitated th
e Mongols significantly. Once their rule was established, they could prove tolerant and even enlightened; 

they certainly did not press subject peoples to abandon existing 
cultures or local institutions. More important, the Mongol network 
greatly accelerated travel and contacts between Asia and Europe, to the primary advantage of the latter. It was under the Mongols that such 

travelers as Marco Polo brought back information about China and 

specific access to Chinese technologies, including printing and explosive powder. The Mongol period was short-livedŠbeginning to 

fade by the later-14
th centuryŠbut its impact, particularly in 
technology exchange, continued to affect world history.  This is the 

context that prompted 
The Economist
, in 1999, to name Chinggis 
(Genghis) Khan the most important historical figure of the then-closing 

millennium in world history. 
 Outline I. The Mongol era in world history covered much of the 13
th and 14th centuries and had decisive results for most of the societies in Europe and 

Asia.  A. The traditional view of the Mongols as bloodthirsty barbarians has 
been almost completely reassesse
d. More recently, the Mongols have been seen as an unusually tolerant people who established a political system that facilitated interregional contact to a greater extent than had 
ever been possible in world history. 
B. In 1999, 
The Economist
, a respectable British periodical, named 
Chinggis (Genghis) Khan the man of
 the millennium. This was largely 
a tribute to Chinggis as the first in a succession of Mongol rulers who  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
19would administer their conquests reasonably wisely and would use 
conquest deliberately to accelerate contact among diffe
rent peoples. C. It is true that the Mongols could 
be cruel, killing urban civilians to ensure that others would yield more quickly to their forces. 

Nonetheless, the dominant revisionist picture seems valid.  
II. The Mongol invasion of China was the last in a series of eruptions from the 
nomadic territories of Central Asia that had earlier seen such groups as the 

Indo-Europeans and Huns pour out. 
A. Probably some combination of population pressure in a fairly fragile 
nomadic economy, political rivalries,
 and divisions in China itself prompted the Mongols to eye the rich society to their east. The 
Mongols had long been one of se
veral border people harassing the 
Chinese and pressing into Chinese territory during the Song dynasty.  
B. Early in the 13
th century, Chinggis Khan conquered a good bit of 
China. The conquest was complete
d in ensuing decades, so that Chinggis™s grandson, Kublai Khan, became ruler of China. This 
Mongol rule, known as the Yuan dynasty, would last for most of the 

next century. 
C. Once in power, the Mongols made use of the Chinese government 
system and bureaucracy, along with Confucian values. Although they 

disapproved of many aspects of Chinese culture, they were generally 
tolerant.  
D. Mongol rule in China brought clear economic benefits, expanding both 
manufacturing and trade opportunities. 
E. In addition to Chinese bureaucrats, the Mongols used a variety of 
foreign administrators in a deliberate attempt to open up the society to 
a wider set of influences.  
III. Mongol conquest soon branched out from China. 
A. In the eastern part of the Middle East, the Mongols conquered Baghdad 
and overthrew the last Arab caliphate. A Mongol khanate was 

established in the eastern Middle East  which held sway for several 

decades. Mongol khanates also fanned out in Central Asia, aiding in the first coherent political organization of that region.  
B. The other great conquest of the Mongols involved Russia toward the 
end of the 13
th century. In Russia, rulers were having increasing 
difficulties with restive nobles. The resulting Mongol sweep across European Russia exempted very few territories but spared Western 

Europe.  C. Mongol efforts also pressed into Southeast Asia at key points.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
20 D. By the late-13
th century, the block of territory held by interlocking 
Mongol khanates was without precedent in world history.  IV. The results of these invasions were si
gnificant, with some durable elements. 
A. Overland travel from west to 
east became increasingly easy.  
 1. Popes began to send Christian emissaries to the Mongols quite 
early, both to persuade the invaders to stay out of Western Europe 
and Catholic territory and to convert some peoples in the Mongol 

realms. 
2. Western merchants took advantage of the safe passage granted by 
khans into Mongol territory.  
3. We also know of some trips by European Jews, artists, and 
entertainers. B. This openness amplified exchanges of knowledge that would gradually 
begin to close the traditional technology gap between East Asia and 

Western Europe. 
C. Accelerated contact in this period 
also had a downside. It was in the Mongol period that the Black Death began in China and spread quickly 

to the Middle East and Europe.  
1. One-quarter to one-third of the population of Western Europe and 
the Middle East succumbed to the plague. 
2. The advantages of access to ne
w technology may 
have outweighed the drawbacks of this level of mortality in Western Europe. 
V. Mongol rule began to decline in the latter part of the 14
th century.  A. The Mongols were unsuccessful in 
two efforts at invading Japan by sea, suggesting some limits to their capacity for expansion.,  
B. The Chinese began to organize more effectively against Mongol rule, 
ousted the Mongols in the latter part of the 14
th century, and quickly 
established the Ming dynasty.  
C. Mongol rule in Russia ended later.  
1. Early in the 15
th century, local Russian rulers increasingly asserted their independence. 
2. By 1450, an autonomous Russian area was established in the 
Moscow region, which then became the center of Russia.  
D. The expulsion of the Mongols from Ch
ina and Russia led to reactions that indicated the distaste that these peoples felt for Mongol control. 

1. The Chinese would become preocc
upied with creating systems to 
prevent the return of invaders like the MongolsŠincluding the 
reconstruction of the Great Wall of China.  
2. The Russian reaction was to undertake a steady series of 
conquests, initially designed to push the Mongols farther back but  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
21ultimately becoming a durable Russian commitment to 
expansionism. 
E. The end of the Mongol period for world history meant a return to 
increasing political barriers; the opportunities for overland travel between Europe and China receded for a considerable period of time. 
VI. The Mongol period should be viewed as something of a rebalancing among 
major societies in Europe and Asia. 
A. The impact on China: 
 1. The Chinese hostility toward outsiders deepened, and defensive 
barriers were created to prevent future invasion.  
 2. The Mongols had also confirmed China™s importance in world 
manufacturing.  
B. The impact on Russia: 
 1. Russians turned from a regiona
l people to an increasingly aggressive and expansionist people.  
 2. This would be a major theme of the next period in world history 
and continues to some extent even today.  
C. The impact on Japan: 
 1. The Japanese, having faced two M
ongol invasions and been spared in one case by a typhoon that destroyed the Mongol fleet, began to 
think of themselves as superior to China.  
 2. This sense of Japanese isolation would be an interesting factor in 
world history in the succeeding period.  D. The impact on Western Europe: 
 1. Aside from borderline clashes, Western Europe did not experience 
the cost or anxiety of direct Mongol invasion; instead, it received the benefit of unusually free contact with Asia.  
2. The Europeans saw the advantages that new kinds of weaponry 
could bring to a highly militaristic society.  
3. The Europeans would make use of printing in ways that would 
have deep implications for 
their culture and bureaucracy. 4. The Europeans, in other words,
 were the leading beneficiaries from this Mongol era.  
E. The impact on Sub-Saharan Africa: 
 1. Sub-Saharan Africa experienced no particular impact from the 
Mongol conquests, but at the same time it had no stimulus to learn 

from new technological
 opportunities.   2. This was a null case, in other words, that would contrast 
interestingly with the experience of Western Europe.

22 VII.  The decline of the Mongol system could have overwhelmed the pattern of 
intensifying interregional contacts that we have so vigorously emphasized 
for the postclassical period, but this system was so successful in its larger 

sense that it readily survived the Mongols.   
A. The question at the end of the 14
th century was not whether world 
contacts would recede, but rather what system, with what routes and 
under whose sponsorship, would replace the Mongol system? 
B. The Mongol era briefly replaced 
and extended the system created 
earlier by the Arabs, but it was not the last gasp of global 
interconnections. That chapter was about to reopen in new ways in the 

15th century.  Further Reading: Gerard Chaliand, Nomadic Empires: From Mongolia to the Danube

disadvantaged, and which societies were unaffected by the Mongol 

conquests?

23Lecture Seventeen  Civilizations in the Americas and in Africa  Scope: Important developments occurred in the Americas and Africa during 
the postclassical period, and of course, they abundantly illustrate the theme of the expanding geography of civilization as a form of human 
organization. The Americas offer a pa
rticular challenge because of the lack of connection to the rest of the world. One scholar, annoyed at the 

problems world historians have with pre-Colombian America, has 

written a book called 1491: Revelations of America before Columbus. The facts remain, however, that v
ital American developments do not 
cleanly fit the larger patterns of the period and that, because of later 
devastation, the heritage of the Americas for subsequent history was 

limited as well. Africa is a different case, complicated mainly by a long 

tradition of historical neglect. African kingdoms and trading patterns in 
the postclassical period were deeply
 connected to the larger world network of the time. Differences fro
m the Americas are thus clear; the 
really interesting comparisons invol
ve such places as Western Europe. 
 Outline I. One of the remaining puzzle pieces to
 fit together for the postclassical period involves the civilizations in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa. In 
this lecture, we will talk about how we can use these two cases to illustrate some of the key themes of the postclassical period. 
II. Civilizations in the Americas began before the postclassical period. 
Because the Americas were not direc
tly connected to Asia, Europe, or Africa, the periodization of the postclassical period is somewhat artificially 
imposed on the Americas.  
A. Early civilizations emerged in Central America, and suggestions of 
early civilization are found a bit later in the Andes. The postclassical 
period itself captures the final flowering of Mayan civilization in 

Central America, the later decline of
 the Mayans, and the emergence of 
a mixed Mayan-Toltec society in parts of Central America.  
B. Also in Central America, the Aztec Empire arose in the mid-14
th century.   1. The Aztecs were immigrants fro
m the north into central Mexico 
and other parts of Central America. 
 2. The Aztec empire would flourish during much of the 15
th century.  C. The postclassical period captures the development of further 
civilization activities in the Andes, particularly the emergence of the 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
24 Inca Empire from about 1400 onwardŠstretching over a long swathe 
of territory along the Pacific Coast of what is now Latin America.  
III. Developments in American civilizations in the postclassical period 
emphasized continued improvements in agriculture. 
A. American societies were based on the cultivation of several key crops, 
including corn and potatoes. The emphasis on agriculture and the 
careful organization of cultivation produced amazing population 
concentrations and impressive cities by the 14
th and 15th centuries.  B. Trading activities were also ex
tensive, with networks running throughout Central America. 
C. Interesting cultural forms arose in the American civilizations, seen in 
artistic representations of fierce gods and goddesses, as well as 

impressive scientific developments. 
D. The postclassical period saw a territorial expansion of American 
civilizations and a flowering of cultural and economic developments.  
IV. Scholars debate the question of how
 to place American patterns into a 
larger world framework in this pre-Colombian, postclassical age.  
A. Charles Mann recently published 
1491: Revelations of America before Columbus
, in which he takes world historians to task for failing to do 
full justice to the richness and detail of pre-1492 American history. 
B. These societies had no effective contact with other parts of the world. 
Although this isolation did not hamper their development before or 
during the postclassical period, it did create vulnerabilities once contact 

was established.  
C. American societies lacked certain technologies, such as the use of 
metal for weaponry or tools and the use of wheels on devices other 

than toys.  
D. The Americas lacked a rich mix of
 animals that were candidates for 
domestication.  
E. Because they had no routine contact
 with other parts of the world, peoples in the Americas were vulne
rable to diseases that had been acclimatized in Afro-Eurasia, notably, smallpox and the measles. Once 

contact was established, American 
societies would suffer dreadfully.  
F. The divide between the Americas be
fore contact and the Americas after 
contact is crucial; given the vulnerabilities in the Americas in 
technology, animal domestication, and disease immunity, 
developments there would be superseded by European and African 
patterns.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
25G. The Americas may have had 
occasional contacts from other 
civilizations, but these contacts were not sufficient to counteract this 
region™s isolation from the world network.  
V. The Americas offer some comparis
ons with other early civilizations. 
A. Some scholars have noted a vague similarity between the Inca Empire, 
with its emphasis on a divine ruler, and ancient Egypt. This can be 

contrasted with a slightly more Mesopotamian civilization, such as 

Central America.  
B. Although American society was overwhelmed after 1492, it was not 
obliterated. Important traces of earlier artistic impulses, polytheistic 

religion, and aspects of local village organization and agricultural 

practices would survive, particul
arly in Central America and the 
Andes. C. It is important to recognize that the legacy here was limited. The 
problem of integrating the American patterns of the postclassical 

period with larger patterns remains considerable. 
VI. In contrast to the Americas, Africa fits quite well into the larger patterns of 
the postclassical period, including its involvement with the world network. 
A. Agriculture and ironworking were introduced early in Africa, and the 
spread of these developments south 
of the Sahara proceeded relatively steadily before and during the postclassical period. 
1. In a process known as the 
great Bantu migrations
, peoples 
originally located in west-cen
tral Africa moved southward and 
eastward, bringing with them agriculture, ironworking, and new 
kinds of political organization.  
2. The spread of the Bantus was a major development in terms of 
connections among African language groups. 
B. Early civilization activities in sub-
Saharan Africa focused in the upper Nile area in some connection to developments in Egypt.  
1. Significant states and cultures developed in Kush and Aksum, 
followed by the establishment of an Ethiopian state.  
2. These activities took place in c
onnection with patterns in the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean, which is one reason 
that Ethiopia received early influences from Judaism and 
Christianity.  
C. In the postclassical period itself, two centers of activity developed in 
Africa.   1. The Swahili belt stretched along th
e Indian Ocean coast in mixed 
Arab-African communities. This region encompassed an active set 

of trading societies and developed a written language and political organizations of the city-state type. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
26  2. Larger kingdoms featuring powerful rulers emerged in sub-
Saharan West Africa. Sometimes called 
Sudanic
 after the Arab word for ﬁblack,ﬂ these kingdoms experienced increasing trade 

activity, including activity that w
ould connect West Africa across 
the Sahara to North Africa and the Middle East.  
VII.  In fitting sub-Saharan African patterns into the larger network of world 
history, we need to explore a few issues. 
A. It is possible to suggest a few characteristic African themes, 
particularly in the Sudanic kingdoms of West Africa. 
1. These civilizations were vigorously polytheistic and used 
polytheism to emphasize the close connections between human 
activities and the forces and features of nature.  
2. These civilizations tended to emphasize the divinity of major 
rulers.  3. These civilizations focused on extended families and the 
connections between individuals in this life and ancestors.   
4. These fairly general features can 
be used to provide at least some 
baseline for discussions of African
 characteristics that cut across states and even larger regions. B. There is a complicated relations
hip between African developments 
before and during the postclassical period and the great religious and 

philosophical systems that developed elsewhere. 
1. African development featured the manipulation of great traditions, 
particularly those derived from Islam and Christianity. 
2. In both the Sudanic kingdoms and the Swahili belt, African 
developments were powerfully influenced by Islam. Outside the 
Swahili belt, however, Islam did not, at this early point, become a 
mass religion.  
VIII. Sub-Saharan African history in the postclassical period should be viewed 
in much the same framework that we
 used for Japan, Russia, Southeast 
Asia, and Western Europe. 
A. Sub-Saharan Africa is another civilization in active contact with the 
most prosperous centers of the world, benefiting from trade with these 
centers and imitating some of their features but also maintaining a 

separate sphere of existence. 
B. One African historian has proposed a close comparison between 
developments in sub-Saharan Africa during the postclassical period 

and those in Western Europe. Using a rough date of 1250 CE, he 

argues that the similarities in these societies are quite striking. 
1. Both civilizations contained significant kingdoms, larger in Africa 
and loosely organized. Although Africa did not develop literal  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
27feudalism, its rule had some overtones of the jockeying necessary 
in European feudal monarchies.  
2. Both civilizations developed new commercial centers and saw 
increased activity linking commer
ce to the Mediterranean and Middle East.  
3. In both civilizations merchant activities were important not only in 
their own right but also in stimulating other economic 

developments and political activity.  
C. If one looks at the same two societies 200 years later, however, the 
comparative situation changes markedly.  
1. European societies, particularly
 Spain and Portugal, were actively 
engaged in exploratory trips down the African coast and were 
experiencing rapid changes in political and cultural systems.  
2. African kingdoms did not exhibit 
the same kind of outreach and 
commitment to major change as 
Western Europe, largely because 
they did not face the same need 
for outreach as Western Europe.  
D. The year 1450 finds the fates of these two societies beginning to 
diverge.

2. If West Africa compares favorably with Western Europe around 1250, in 
terms of international role, trade, and even politics, how and why does the 
comparison around 1450 begin to look so different?

28 Lecture Eighteen  The World in 1450  Scope: A number of crucial changes t
ook place by the middle of the 15
th century, many of which would set the stage for the next period in world 
history. Several of the developments were conditioned by the decline 

of the Arabs and the receding of the Mongol empires. The most 

familiar, undeniably important 
change involved the increasing explorations by Europeans down the African coast; this pattern, 

however, must be put into a world historical perspective. China made a 

number of crucial decisions in this period also, extending and then 

ending a fascinating series of expeditions. Russia, by 1450, was casting 

off Mongol rule but was also deeply affected by the death throes of the 

Byzantine Empire. Change in the Middle East highlighted the rise of 

the Ottoman Turks, a development with implications for Europe and 
Russia as well.  Quite coincidentally
, changes in the Americas prepared 
for later shifts in the global mix. 
 Outline I. Almost all world historians agree that around 1450 or 1500 a significant 
break occurred in world history.  
A. By 1450, the great era of Arab 
politics and merchant activity had 
passed, as had the Mongol era.  
B. Given the demise of these two great systems and the continued 
importance of interregional economic and cultural contacts, what kind 
of system would replace thes
e previous frameworks?  
II. Specific developments in the first half of the 15
th century focused on China.  A. With the expulsion of the Mongols from China at the end of the 14
th century, the Ming dynasty came to power. Like many new dynasties, it 

was vigorous, benefiting from an expanding economy and interested in 

new political statements and a degree of territorial expansion. 
B. Beginning in 1405, under the Ming, the Chinese mounted a series of 
huge expeditions that took troops, goods, and political and cultural representatives from the Pacific Coast of China through Southeast Asia 

to East Asia, South Asia, West As
ia, and the Indian Ocean coast of Africa.  1. These expeditions were likely mounted to extend the Chinese 
custom of seeking tribute from neighboring contacts.  
2. For 30 years, these expeditions provided the most striking 
interregional contacts operating during the 15
th century as a whole.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
293. The expeditions were successful in bringing Chinese connections 
to Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia; in establishing a 
new Chinese presence in India; and in establishing links directly 

with the Middle East, particularly the Persian Gulf region, and 

with the states of East Africa.  4. The expeditions were an important assertion of economic strength, 
building on the established position of Chinese manufacturing that 

had begun in the Song dynasty and had been extended under the 

Mongol Yuan dynasty.  
C. In 1433, the expeditions were 
ended by imperial decision. 
1. There may have been a certain 
traditionalist bureaucratic suspicion 
of these costly expeditions on the grounds that they 

overemphasized naval activities and commercial groups.  
2. A new Ming emperor wanted to establish policies that would be 
different from those of his predecessor.  
3. It is also possible that alt
hough the expeditions had resulted in considerable tribute, the crude economic calculationŠin terms of 

short-run cost benefitsŠargued for termination. 
D. The new representative of the dynasty further believed that investment 
monies should go to two other important projects. 
1. One project was a new Ming capital in Beijing. 
2. Another project was the reconstruction of the Great Wall of China 
(to keep the Mongols at bay). 
E. The end of the Chinese expeditions did not end China™s economic role 
in world trade, nor did it isolate China from the rest of the world. It did, 
however, signal an end to the brief flurry of Chinese initiative into the 

rest of the world. III. A second center of developments around 1450 involved the Middle East 
and southeast Europe.  
A. The decline of Arab rule in these regions left openings for the 
immigration of new peoples from Central Asia, particularly the 
Osmanli Turks or Ottoman Turks, who began to appear around 1450. 
B. The Ottoman Turks were fervent Muslims, heavily influenced by 
Sufism. As they migrated into the 
area, they seized territories from 
Arab states and focused on attacking the Byzantine Empire.  
1. A major player during the postclassical period, the Byzantine 
Empire had been declining for some decades before 1450; this 

decline made the empire a prime target for this new series of 

interlopers.  
2. The Turks laid siege to Constantinople, and in 1453 the city fell 
and was renamed Istanbul; this fall is one of the great events in 

world history. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
30 3. For the Middle East, the fall re
presented a clear step in the establishment of the Ottoman Empire, which would provide a new 
source of political and military power to a region that had been 

fragmented for almost two centuries. 
C. The fall of Constantinople also represented a new opportunity for the 
Turks and Islam to move into the Balkans and southeastern Europe.  
1. Even before the fall, the Turks had seized territories in parts of 
modern-day Greece; thus the change
 for southeastern Europe was in many ways just as great as the impending change for parts of the 
Middle East.  
2. The Byzantine Empire had b
een the model for Russian 
development, and the collapse of Constantinople represented both 
a terrifying challenge to the Russian sense of identity and gave 

Russia a new sense of itself as heir to the mission of the old 

empire. 
D. The fall of Constantinople was a symbolic and real challenge to other 
parts of Europe, including Western Europe.  
1. West Europeans, particularly Italians, had treated Constantinople 
scornfully in the last days of the Byzantine Empire.  
2. West Europeans ignored appeals from later Byzantine emperors 
for assistance against the assailing Turks, but when the city fell, 
Europeans had to face the fact that a bastion of Christianity had been removed in favor of a new and fairly potent Islamic presence.  
E. In conjunction with these developments, Russian political rulers began 
to fully cast off Mongol rule in the early-15
th century. By 1450, a 
steadily expansionist Russian state was forming around Moscow, and 
the fall of Byzantium served as an additional spur. 
IV. Not every place in the world change
d or changed significantly in 1450. A. Africa experienced basic continuity, despite political shifts and changes 
in trading patterns. The rise of the kingdom of Songhai was an 

important development in the Sudanic region.  
B. 1450 was not a striking point in Japanese development even though 
some adjustment took place. 
C. Developments in India were not marked by any dramatic shifts around 
1450. The more dramatic changes would come 50 or 70 years later 

with a new series of Islamic invasions into India. 
V. We also find significant deve
lopments in the Americas.  
A. By 1450, both the Aztecs and the Incas were beginning to encounter 
new challenges to their rule.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
31B. Quite independent of other events, then, the political structures of the 
late postclassical period in the Americas were beginning to unravel. 
This would facilitate European entry after 1492.  VI. The final series of developments occurred in new forms of European 
outreach.  A. Beginning as early as the 13
th century, individual merchants and rulers 
had shown some interest in breaking the confines of European 
geography and its focus on the Medite
rranean as an artery of trade. B. Farther to the north, Scandinavians had crossed the Atlantic and 
reached North America, then retreated
 to more interesting and durable 
settlements in Greenland and Iceland. 
C. By the early-15
th century, patterns of exploration down the African 
coast were extended. This exploration was sponsored by the king of 

Portugal, newly freed from Muslim control, and by rulers in Spain. 
1. The explorations pushed steadily down the African coast, partly in 
search of gold.  
2. The larger framework, however, 
was the recognition that Europe 
faced difficulties in postclassical interregional relationships.  3. The Europeans had developed a taste for Asian goods but not the 
capacity to pay for these goods; by seeking new sources of gold 
and other opportunities, the Europeans were trying to remedy a 
clear problem in their interregional outreach.  
4. Europeans also wondered if they could find a direct connection 
with Asia around the African coast to avoid Islamic middlemen 

and cultural challenges.  
5. This interest in finding solutions to the cultural and economic 
problems of dependence on Islamic merchants was further 

galvanized by the fall of Constantinople and the new potential for 

Muslim organization in the eastern Mediterranean.  
VII.  The conventional textbooks on West European history offer a somewhat 
different background to these new expeditions. A. By 1450, European political capac
ity was beginning to improve. The 
feudal monarchies in England, France, and increasingly Spain and 

Portugal had achieved a bit more central control over their territories. 

They also had somewhat greater 
capacity to guide trade policy and 
mount significant expl
oratory expeditions. B. European Christianity, not a new force, may have been given a new 
lease on life in terms of missionary spirit by the expulsion of the 

Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula. Spanish and, to a lesser degree, 

Portuguese Catholic leaders played prominent roles in the explorations 

that began to take shape in the 15
th century.  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
32 C. We also need to acknowledge 
new attitudes developing in the Renaissance, first in Italy and, by 1450, spreading more widely. The 
Renaissance brought new attention to this-worldly activities and suggested new confidence in the potential of individual achievement. 
D. Nonetheless, the world history picture continues to be more 
complicated than a focus on just
 the West allows. Key problems 
remained in terms of world position, including the issue of Islamic 

intermediaries and the need to compensate for Islamic control in the 
eastern Mediterranean. VIII. As the expeditions unfolded in 1450 and afterward, they reveal a few 
other points that bring us back to motivations. 
A. The expeditions failed to find massive troves of new wealth, although 
they did find some new territories. Europeans began to take over island 
groups in the southern Atlantic, such as the Azores and the Canaries.  
B. The native populations of these islands were extremely vulnerable to 
some of the common diseases brought
 by the Europeans, resulting in rapid depopulation. This was, at once, a useful development for the 

EuropeansŠlocal resistance was mini
malŠand a challenge because of 
the obvious need to find additional sources of labor. C. The solution adopted was to raid the northwest African mainland, 
where slavery was well established, for sources of labor. The 
Europeans began to import African slaves into these island groups with 

the purpose of establishing sugar cultivation.  
D. This policy was perfectly understandable in terms of European interest: 
The Europeans had an economic problem, and growing sugarŠrather 

than importing it from AsiaŠwas at least a partial remedy. 
Nonetheless, this policy of economic exploitation raised some 
interesting questions about the nature of the European role in the world 
as Europeans gained new levels of power.  
E. Once the Europeans su
cceeded in rounding the southern tip of Africa and reaching Asia directly, they still had a balance-of-payments 
problem.  
1. When Vasco da Gama returned to India for a second time after 
1500, he brought a solution to this problem in the form of guns.  
2. Da Gama deliberately slaughtered a number of Indian officials to 
induce the rest of the population to trade, even though the 
Europeans did not yet have much to offer in the exchange. 
IX.
 Moving forward from 1450, a variety of developments occurred in a 
number of different places.  
A. Both the Chinese expeditions and 
their curtailment set the stage for 
European initiatives that would form a new framework for 
interregional trade.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
33B. Developments in the Middle East, the arrival of the Turks, the fall of 
one of the great Christian empires, and the beginning of new assertions 
by Russians also need to be factored into the world picture. C. The end of the postclassical period saw the gradual emergence of a 
new system of interregional trade that would be immensely important, 

but it also saw power and cultural shifts in other regions. It also set the 

stage for a complex pattern of development in world history™s next 

period.

34 Lecture Nineteen  The Early Modern Period, 1450
1750  Scope: The most important development in this new period of world history 
involved the rise of international trade and the redefinition of this trade to include the entire globe for the first time. Western Europe was a key 

agent in much of this change, 
including the new contacts with the 
Americas and, at the end of the 
period, with Pacific Oceania and Australia. The conventional emphasis for the period, in terms of a 

fascination with growing European strength and changes within Europe 

itself, is accurate but should not overshadow the broader patterns of change. European dominance of the Am
ericas and its new influence in Africa are qualified by a much more
 complicated relationship with 
most of Asia. A final theme for the periodŠwhat historians often call 
the age of gunpowder empires
Šcalls attention not only to the 
emergence of Europe™s overseas colonies but also to the rise of several 
new land-based agglomerations in As
ia. The early modern period thus 
focuses on new patterns of trade and new exchanges, along with a new 

spurt of empire formation from several sources. Strong elements of this 

new global economic system persist today.  Interestingly, the period is 

not defined by any overall pattern
s of cultural change, despite 
significant developments in particular regions.  
 Outline I. The early modern period in world history runs roughly from 1450 to 1750.  
A. In contrast to the classical and postclassical periods (lasting 1,500 and 
1,000 years, respectively), the early modern period is relatively short 

(300 years). 
1. One explanation for this shorter 
time span may be that the pace of 
change became more rapid. 
2. As we get closer to the present we have more abundant records.  
3. We also tend to spend more time on periods that are closer to the 
present because, inevitably, they have more influence on current 
patterns of activity. 
B. Some historians would argue that 1500 is a better date for the start of 
the early modern period.  
 1. By 1500, it was clear that the Europeans would introduce 
significant changes in the Americas.  
 2. By 1500, the Ottoman Empire had expanded from southwestern 

Europe and the northeastern Middle East to include portions of 

North Africa, especially Egypt.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
35C. The end of the period, 1750, is a date of convenience meant to indicate 
the coming changes brought on by European industrialization. 
D. The early modern period is where many world history educational 
programs go awry, focusing on European power after 1450 and the 
glories of change in the West. This view distorts and oversimplifies the 

continued complexity of the world as a whole. 
1. We must recognize that the power of Western Europe did increase 
and that the nature of the West itself was significantly transformed.   
2. That said, Europe did not run the world in 1750: many societies, 
continued to act independently of Europe, and important 
developments occurred that had very little to do with Europe.  
II. In establishing a new period in history, we must show that the previously 
predominant themes have lost some force. 
A. The postclassical period was defined by expansion in the geographical 
range, the number of civilizations, the impact of the world religions, 
and the establishment of a world network connecting different parts of 

Africa, Asia, and Europe. 
1. Because the main contours of th
e civilization zones were fairly well established, expansion was no longer a dominating principle.  
2. For the world as a whole, the religious map was fairly well 
established.  
3. The world network was still an operative concept but was 
transformed by of the inclusi
on of the Americas. The earlier 
network was an intense interrelationship among different societies 
in what we might call the Old World; the new world economy is 

global and even more intense. 
B. What, then, are the new themes? 
1. The most important developments in the early modern period are 
the intensification of interregional trade connections and the 

inclusion of the Americas (a
nd later Pacific Oceania).  2. Other new themes include the new power relationship of the West 
in the world, the biological exchanges that resulted from European 
and African contact with the Americas, and the ﬁexplosionﬂ of 
gunpowder empires. 
III. Carlo Cipolla sums up the expansion 
of Europe in the title of his book, Guns, Sails, and Empires
.  A. By the 15
th century, Europeans had adapted Chinese explosive powder 
for use in guns, particularly cannons. The technology for casting 

church bells was transferred to casting bronze and iron cannons.  
B. Sails came from adaptations of Arab shipping, and Europeans learned 
how to make more effective ocea
ngoing vessels, which proved to be 
particularly successful in navigating the waters of the Atlantic and then 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
36 the Pacific; at the same time 
there was an increasing use of navigational devices such as the compass. 
C. Guns and sails in this period took Europeans to islands and coastal 
regions where they could establish oceangoing contact and use their 
sea-based cannons to intimidate and threaten.  
1. Europeans seized port cities in 
West Africa and occasionally East 
Africa, some ports in India, island groups in what is now 
Indonesia, territory in Taiwan, and the Philippines. 2. With rare exceptions, the interior of Africa and Asia would remain 
immune to European conquest at this point.  
D. In the Americas, Europeans had the added advantage of metal tools and 
technologies, horses, and military organization that, in some instances, 
was superior to that of the Native American peoples.  
E. The Europeans also had the ﬁadvantageﬂ of disease. Up to 80 or 85 
percent of the total Native American population died off from disease 

within two centuries. This cleared the way for European conquest as no 

other development could. 
F. With regard to the European wea
pons and naval advantages, we might 
well ask why no other society in the early modern period chose to rival 

the Europeans in this game. 
1. Several other societies had metalworking traditions, shipbuilding 
capabilities, as well as experience in interregional activity, but 
chose not to imitate the European patterns of expansion.  
2. The Chinese had no use for such
 expansion primarily because it 
did not serve the purposes of Chinese society itself.  3. The case is similar in Japan. In the 16
th century, the Japanese were especially interested in new types of European weapons but at the 

end of the century they cut off European contacts, partly because Catholic control in the Philippines was viewed as a threat and 

European weapons endangered the system of feudalism. 
G. The sense that European patterns were not relevant to the goals of key 
societies motivated a distinctive stance toward European technology. 

Europeans, in turn, viewed themselves as having a technological edge 

over the new societies they came in contact with and began to judge 

other societies mainly by the state of their technology. 
IV. Another key development in this period involved what historians routinely 
call the 
Colombian exchange
. This term refers to the fact that biological 
products moved from the Americas to the rest of the world and vice versa, 

an exchange that was almost entir
ely disastrous for the Americas.  
A. Biological exchange meant that Ol
d World domesticated animals were 
brought to the Americas, as were Old World food products.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
37B. Unfortunately, the main biological import to the Americas was disease. 
At first, the impact wa
s accidental, though by the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans deliberately introduced diseases into Native 
American populations in order to clear them out.  
C. The Colombian exchange for other parts of the world was arguably 
beneficial; American food products began to spread widely to other 
areas, helping to sustain and even augment populations 
D. African involvement in the Colombian exchange was complicated. 
New World foods, particularly corn, spread widely to Africa and 
helped sustain population development. But another biological 
exchange took the form of people themselves moving to the Americas.  
1. Beginning in the 16
th century, 8Œ12 million Africans would be 
seized in the Atlantic slave tr
ade and taken to the Americas. 
2. This level of displacement had 
serious consequences for AfricaŠparticularly West AfricaŠbecause
 a disproportionate number of 
the slaves were young males at a prime age for reproduction.  
E. The most vigorous impact of the Colombian exchange had ended by 
the early-18th century. People became more re
sistant to disease in the Americas, and the bulk of the population was now of mixed European 
and Native American heritage. 
V. The early modern period is also known as the age of gunpowder empires. 
A. The Europeans, led by the Spanish and Portuguese and followed by the 
Dutch, British, and French, established their overseas empires in the 

Americas and in parts of Asia and Africa.  
B. Equally important was the establishment of land-based gunpowder 
empires in Asia.  
 1. The Ottoman Turks, for example, had used gunpowder and cannon 
in their siege of Constantinople and established their empire partly 

based on this technology.  
 2. The Mughal Empire in India was also organized by invaders using 
new weaponry.  
 3. The Safavid Empire in Persia and the Russian Empire were based 
in part on gunpowder.  
C. The new empires that arose in Eastern Europe and much of Asia were 
quite different in orientation from the more commercially minded 

overseas empires but equally important
 because they maintained sway 
over a significant landmass and dynamic economies.  
D. Even in China, the Qing dynasty, launched in the 17
th century by Manchurians, was partly a gunpowder empire. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
38 VI. We can pinpoint a few social and cultural areas where we do not see major 
developments in this period. 
A. The early modern era is not a distinct period with regard to gender 
relationships, although we can see some changes.  

1. The arrival of Europeans in th
e Americas had implications for 
American gender relations b
ecause European values and expectations differed greatly 
from Native American traditions. 
2. In withdrawing men from Africa,
 the slave trade increased the importance of polygamy to provide family arrangements for the 
remaining women.  
3. There is no blanket pattern, however, that allows us to use the 
early modern period for purposes of gender discrimination.  
B. In the same way, culture in the ear
ly modern period reveals changes in 
specific cases but no blanket pattern. 
1. The importation of European religion, artistic styles, and some 
science to the Americas was a ma
jor change in American cultural 
history.  
2. European culture would also change
 with, for example, the rise of 
science and the division of West European Christendom.  
3. In the world as a whole in the 
early modern period, however, there 
is no overall cultural dynamic: individual societies, such as Japan 
or China, would indulge new opportunities for contact to a degree but not at the expense of substantial cultural differentiation. 
VII.  Let us close by reviewing the main themes of the early modern period. 
A. The rise of Europe was accomp
anied by the establishment of 
significant political units in other parts of the world that would long overshadow Western politics.  
B. The biological exchange that resulted from the inclusion of the 
Americas in the world network prompted various reactions.  
 1. Many societies had to make decisions about how to handle new 
contacts with the West, including whether they would make use of 

new foods.   2. They also had to make decisions about the impact of new imperial 
structures, land-based as well as sea-based. 
C. The central theme in this period was the intensification of economic 
relationships, which now also included the Americas and, at the end of 

the period, parts of the Pacific.  
D. One interpretation of this period argues that the West managed to 
position itself as a transmitter of Am
erican goods, and this transmission 
served as the engine of the world economy with much more diverse 

benefits and implications than we usually think of when we look at the 

rise of the West alone.

40 Lecture Twenty 
 The World Economy, 1450
1750  Scope: In the early modern period, world trade increased, becoming literally 
global and seeing an increasingly powerful role for the West. Above 
all, trade became more important to 
many societies, helping to shape 
not only economic life but political a
nd social systems as well. With 
the growing importance of trade in such products as slaves, sugar, 

silver, guns, and elite craft items, a number of societies began to 

develop elaborate relationships of 
superiority and dependence. Western 

Europe became the superior play
er: it had strong governments and a 
flexible wage labor system, and it emphasized manufactured products 

such as guns or luxury furnishings, that could earn top money in world 

trade. The West carried the tr
ade in its ships and commercial 
companies, other sources of profit. On the other hand, peripheral 

societies exported cheap foods and raw materials, using coercive labor 

to cut costs (and to respond to labor shortages), relying on merchant 

companies and ships from the European core, and importing more 

expensive items. Weak governments followed from the lack of an 

ample tax base, the interference of the West, and the desire of landlords 

to regulate their own labor forces. Wealth flowed from the periphery to 

the Western core. Latin America,
 the Caribbean, and the North American South were the classic peri
pheries, but West Africa, with its 
slave trade, had peripheral characteristics. By the 18th century, grain-exporting regions such as Poland, which relied on serf labor, were 

becoming peripheries also. The biggest problem with the world 

economy approach, for the early modern period, involves the 

continuing success of Asian economies, 
headed by China. We will take 
this complexity into account as we discuss the world economy.  
 Outline I. The main development underlying all others in the early modern period was 
the intensification of world economic relationships and the inclusion of the 

Americas in those relationships.  
A. When we discussed the world network in the postclassical period, we 
mentioned that it was capable of affecting basic manufacturing 
patterns, as in China, for example. When we look at the early modern 

period, we see the same kind of intensification operating at a higher 

level in a set of different economies.  
B. Immanuel Wallerstein, an American sociologist, developed 
world 
economy theory
 to explain this intensification; the theory is a useful 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
41device for exploring relationships in the early modern period and even 
in the present day. C. In addition to illustrating general 
points about intensification, world economy theory has three advantages. 
1. It clarifies systematic inequalities in international economic 
relationships that emerged in the early modern period and, thus, 
helps explain why societies otherwise as different as Latin 

America and Poland can be viewed through something of the same 

lens.  
2. It deals with relationships between export and import activities 
within societies, economic position in the world economy, and 
political structures and labor systems.  
3. It helps to explain why certain patterns endure for so long and why 
they are hard to eliminate. 
D. We should note, however, that world economy theory has been widely 
criticized for omitting certain factor
s (such as culture and technology) and for oversimplifying some points. The theory also has difficulty in 
dealing with change and does not do justice to the complexity of 

patterns in Asia  
II. Wallerstein introduces four key concepts, three of which we will discuss in 
this lecture. 
A. He identifies core and peripheral so
cietiesŠthe ﬁwinnersﬂ and ﬁlosersﬂ in the early modern world economy.
 Because not all societies were fully enmeshed in the world economy at this point, Wallerstein also 
brings in external societies, in which the economy is not primarily 

dependent on global relationships. 
B. Wallerstein argues that these economic relationshipsŠparticularly the 
crucial duo of core/peripheryŠare born with the early modern period. 

Although elements of these relationships existed in the postclassical 
period, they become more rigorous in the period we are discussing. 
III. Examples of core societies include Spain and Portugal in the initial phases 
of the early modern period and Britain, France, and Holland by the 17
th century.  A. A core society makes profits from the world economy by exporting 
finished goods, organizing the trading companies that direct world 
commerce, and building and running the ships that carry trade. In the 

long term, the core society profits
 from the world economy because of 
its capacity to control activities and facilities in these three categories. 
B. Economic advantage, however, is cl
osely linked to political advantage. In Wallerstein™s view, core societies not only have profitable economic 

relationships internationally, but they also have fairly strong states.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
42 1. As a society profits from the international economy, tax revenues 
increase, enabling the society to fund a more elaborate system of 
government.  
2. With a strong government backed
 by a strong military, a core 
society can intervene in international situations in ways that will 

help position its merchants advantageously. 
C. Wallerstein also argues that core societies increasingly adopt wage 
labor systems, using wages to motiv
ate workers and to locate workers where manufacturing opportunities exist. 
IV. Peripheral societies are the mi
rror image of core societies. 
A. Peripheral societies have depe
ndent economies through which they 
import expensive products primarily from core societies and export 

raw, unprocessed goods. B. Trade in peripheral societies is
 carried by merchants from core 
societies and depends heavily on ships from core economies.  
C. Obviously, peripheral societies tend to lose money in international 
economic exchange. They are just as fully engaged in trade as core 

societies, but their engagement involves systematic disadvantages.  
D. Peripheral societies have weak gove
rnments because they do not have 
the tax revenues to strengthen government. The core societies have a 

stake in keeping these governments weak so that their own merchants 

and interventions will not encounter resistance.  E. Peripheral economies (at least in the early modern period) do not rely 
primarily on wage labor but on forced or coercive labor, slavery, or 

harsh serfdom.  
V. These economic, political, and social system or labor system relationships 
are easily uncovered in the early modern period. 
A. The core societies initially we
re Spain and Portugal, although ultimately, their positions slipped. In the end, the great core societies 
were those in much of the European northwestŠFrance, Holland, 

Britain, and others. 
1. These societies spawned large tr
ading companies that organized 
trade and sent out ships. 
2. These societies also experienced a significant and steady increase 
in manufacturing, including both craft manufacturing and domestic 
or home production. 
B. In using Wallerstein™s theory, we need to guard against 
oversimplification.  
 1. For example, although France and Britain were both core societies, 
France had a much stronger government and military than Britain 

in the early modern period. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
43C. The classic peripheral society, 
of course, was Latin America. 
1. Latin America produced sugar, silver, wood products, and other 
goods that were mostly sent elsewhere for processing. 
2. In its colonial period, Latin 
America experienced quite weak 
governments. 
3. Latin American economies featured, essentially, versions of 
serfdom, the 
encomienda and hacienda
 systems, in which laborers 
were forced either to work certain days or to turn over certain 
percentages of their products. 
D. Wallerstein notes that by the 18
th century, peripheries were developing 
in parts of Eastern Europe, particularly Poland; there, amid harsh 

serfdom conditions, emphasis was increasingly placed on producing 

grain for sale in Western markets. In this trade, we see Polish reliance 

on the export of relatively cheap products, carried in Western ships, in 

patterns organized by Western merchant companies. 
E. West Africa can also be seen as a peripheral economy if we argue that 
slaves constitute unprocessed goods.  1. African slave systems developed through a combination of African 
merchant and political or
ganization, occasionally with some direct 
European intervention. Slaves were then sold to 
European traders and transported by European ships and commercial companies. 
2. In return, African merchant
s and political figures received processed goods from the core societies. 
VI. In looking at the peripheral societies, again, we need to be aware of 
oversimplification and some other rough points in categorization. 

A. For example, although West Africa was a peripheral society, its 
governments were much stronger than those of Latin America and 
much more capable of regulating European activity.  
B. As European intervention increas
ed in India and what is now 
Indonesia, economies there developed some peripheral characteristics, 

although they did not shift entirely to a peripheral status.  
C. The British colonies in North America also present problems of 
categorization. 1. The South, with its concentration on the production of sugar and 
other goods for sale to Europe, clearly was a periphery.  
2. The middle colonies and New England, however, did not fit easily 
into Wallerstein™s scheme. These areas had a significant local 
merchant class, engaged in some manufacturing, and ran some 
shipping, but they were not yet core economies. 
VII.  The key issue in Wallerstein™s theory, however, is Asia. 
A. Wallerstein does not deal with Asia in great detail in his treatment of 
the early modern period, but the implications of his work suggest that 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
44 Asia must be viewed largely as an external economy, that is, the Asian 
economy was not sufficiently involved in world trade to be affected by 

world trade dimensions. 
1. This position feeds and is fed by misperceptions about Asia™s 
economic role in the world in this period, including its degree of 
isolation and disdain for commerce. 
2. If we dispel these notions, the idea of externality must be largely 
dispelled as well. 
B. Japan had the one clear external Asian economy by the 17
th century.  1. Around 1600, the Japanese cut off elaborate contacts with the 
West; without question, Japan™s economy was not a significant 

participant in world trade patterns in the 17
th and 18th centuries. 2. Because Japan recognized the utility
 of maintaining some outlet to 
the wider world, however, the Japanese allowed the Dutch to trade 

near the port of Nagasaki.  
3. Externality was not complete, but Japan fits the external category 
fairly well in this period. Indeed, the early modern period saw 

considerable development of co
mmercial operations in Japan, 

although not as a result of external economic relations. 
C. For the Middle East, India, and particularly China, however, externality 
simply does not apply.  
1. China received the largest amount
 of New World silver of any 
society in the 16th18th centuries, largely as the European solution 
to its old balance-of-payments problem for Chinese exports. 
2. This flood of silver into China had significant impact.  In the 17
th century, for example, the Chinese government decided that all 
taxes must be paid in silver currency. This requirement almost 

certainly resulted in increased inequality for peasants.  
3. China could not possibly earn this much New World silver and be 
regarded as an external economy, but it is not exactly core either 

because Chinese merchants and ship
s did not go out into the world beyond Southeast Asia.  
4. China was a manufacturing powerhouse but not, for foreign trade 
purposes, a commercial powerhouse; China had a strong 

government and traded actively with Southeast Asia, but on a 

global basis it did not operate as a core society. 
D. Some of the same points apply to India, at least until the 18
th century. 1. India was the second largest recipient of New World silver 
because the Indians also had a variety of goods that Europeans desired.  India, however, had little need for European goods during the early modern period. 
2. By the 18
th century, with increased foreign intervention in India, 
its position shifted into a more dependent category, but for most of 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
45the early modern period both India and the Middle East had some 
advantage in trade with Europeans. 
VIII. A modified view of the early modern world economy system makes sense. 
A. With regard to Latin America, 
Africa, and some parts of Eastern 
Europe, European economic dominance is real; it is a source of new 

profits for the West and new pattern
s of economic and political activity 
for the peripheral societies. B. Nonetheless, this is not yet a world system, and it must be modified to 
account for not only the decline of Spain and Portugal but the new 

position of India. Wallerstein™s picture is further complicated by such 
factors as population shortages and cultural attitudes. C. Properly adjusted, Wallerstein™s theo
ry explains why different societies 
fell into systematic patterns of inequality in the international 
marketplace in the early modern peri
od and why this system tended to 
be so persistent. It is possible to fall out of the core, as Spain and 

Portugal did, but it is much more difficult to climb out of the periphery.

46 Lecture Twenty-One 
 Transformations in Western Europe  Scope: Partly because of its growing 
world role and rising earnings from 
international trade, Western Europe changed greatly in the three 
centuries after 1450. Many of the items on a list of key developments 

are quite familiar: the Renaissance, including the Northern 

Renaissance; the Protestant and Catholic Reformations; the price 

revolution of the 16
th century (prompted by the import of increasing 
amounts of silver and promoting further commercial expansion); the 

rise of absolutism (but also the advent of parliamentary monarchies in 

Britain and Holland); the Scientific Revolution; and the Enlightenment. 

These developments did not all neatly mesh, and other interesting 

episodes suggested some of the tensions involved with uneven and 

sometimes contradictory changeŠt
he witchcraft craze of the 17th century is a leading case in point. From a world history standpoint, 

there are two major issues: First, with all due credit to the growing 

importance of the West, it would be misleading to linger too long over 

the details of activities in a single society. Second, these changes must 
be placed in a world history contextŠcompared with developments 

elsewhere and assessed for their greater impact. The focus of this 
lecture, then, is on the big changes in the West and their larger 
implications for world history. This focus, in turn, calls for attention to 
growing commercialization in the economy, which paralleled the larger 
international role; the growth of state functions and the emergence of 
the nation state; and a series of changes in both formal and popular 
culture, many of them revolving around the rise of science.  
 Outline I. The early modern centuries constituted an exceptionally busy time for 
Western Europe.  
A. The list of major European activities during this time is formidable: 
 1. The migration of the Renaissance to the north from about 1450 
onward.   2. The 16
th-century Protestant and Catholic Reformations.  
 3. The price revolution.  
 4 The rise of absolutism in the 17
th century.   5. The parliamentary monarchies that developed in Britain and the 
Netherlands. 
 6. The Scientific Revolution.  
 7. The 18
th-century Enlightenment.

47B. World history does not afford us the opportunity to spend as much time 
on these developments as we might in a Western civilization approach. 
How can we make this range of developments in Western Europe 

manageable enough to fit into a world history pattern? 
C. In this lecture, we will take 
ﬁa big changes approach,ﬂ looking at 
significant shifts in Western Europe between 1450 and 1750. This 

approach does not do justice to all the individual movements and 

currents in Western Europe but is necessary for understanding the 
bigger picture. 
D. We will also look briefly at the gl
obal implications of these changes. 
E. We will evaluate the big changes in the West in terms of their 
placement among existing global standards.  
II. Big changes in the West in the early modern period fall into four categories.  
A. First is the increasing place of the We
st in world trade and, to a lesser extent, in world power politics. From world trade, the West gained 
access to new ideas and perspectives and new levels of wealth and 
commercial opportunity. Although we w
ill focus on the other three big developments in the West, this repositioning in the world was a 

fundamental change in and of itself. 
B. The other three big developments involved an increasing 
commercialization of the West European economy, increasing 

governmental efficiency and rationalization, and fundamental shifts in 

cultural outlook. 
III. The first of the three is commercialization. 
A. During the 16
th, 17th, and 18th centuries, more Europeans became 
involved in the commercial economy, producing at least some goods 

for sale on the market. 
1. In the 17
th century, southern French peasants and landlords began 
producing wine for sale to other regions, thus involving 
themselves in importing food for consumption.  
2. Villages began to specialize in cer
tain kinds of production. In both agriculture and manufacturing, ordinary people, as well as 

merchants and landlords, began to produce more for the market 

and to adopt an explicit set of market motivations and practices.  
3. This meant a growing importance for the merchant class of 
Western Europe, which expanded and gained wealth from both 
international and domestic trade. 
4. The expansion of domestic manufacturing in Western Europe was 
also important. Under this system, rural people devoted more 

effort to producing goods for sale to merchants in nearby cities. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
48 B. Commercialization was accompanied 
by a growing gap between the large numbers of people who owned property and the propertyless or 
near propertyless workers. 
1. European class structure shifte
d away from the community-based 
relationships that had predominated in the postclassical centuries.  
2. This change was accompanied 
by a new and harsher attitude toward poverty, even as early as the late-16
th century. C. This commercialization of the European economy falls under the 
heading of a catch-up development. It brought Europe to economic 
levels that had previously been achieved in such places as China and other parts of Asia.  
D. By the 18
th century, developments began to press beyond the catch-up 
level. 
1. The expansion of domestic manufacturing and the introduction of 
new technologies (such as the flying shuttle in weaving) pushed the European economy beyond levels that had been achieved in 
other societies.  
2. Another 18
th-century developmentŠrecently uncoveredŠis the 
beginning of modern consumerism in Western Europe, predating 

the Industrial Revolution. 
IV. The second category of development is politics.  
A. Until the 17
th century, European politics can still broadly be described 
in terms of the earlier emphasis on feudalism. But by the 17
th century, though feudal remnants lingered, European states were beginning to 

develop a new range of activities and a sense of rationalization.  
B. Central governments now began to send out increasing numbers of 
bureaucrats to the provinces to ensure that central edicts were enforced uniformly throughout the realm and to 
monitor local conditions. At this 
point, national boundaries began to matter.  
C. New functions included such activities as cultural intervention. In the 
17th century, the French monarchy, 
for example, established an 
institution to monitor and regularize the French language; and in this 

same period, European states began to set up prisons. 
D. Along with the expansion of function came rationalization, an 
increasingly self-conscious effort to think through how government 

activities were organized. The military serves as a prime example: in 

the 17
th century, many European armies began to acquire uniforms, 
define officer grades, formalize training for officers, organize hospitals 

and logistical systems, and establish pensions. 
E. Most of these developments were catch-up activities, that is, European 
governments were now begi
nning to do things that political systems in 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
49several other societies had already done, although, again, with 
particular European emphases.  
F. By the 17
th and 18th centuries, however, we see an innovative twistŠ
the clear beginnings of the idea of 
a nation state, a state in which a shared culture and tradition would co
exist with the state itself. The 
nation state concept was a fundamental innovation on the world scene 

that would have a wide impact beyond Europe as well as within it. 
V. The third category of development is culture.  
A. The advent of printing in Eur
ope opened up massive opportunities for 
Europeans to have contact with the written word. Literacy advanced 
systematically, and by the 18
th century Western Europe had the highest 
literacy rates of any large society in the world. 
B. The Protestant Reformation, despite some effective Catholic response, 
shattered the unity of Western Christianity and led to internal conflicts 
and tensions. In the long run it tended to reduce religious commitment 

in Europe and promote some idea of religious toleration.  
C. During the Scientific Revolution of the 17
th century, the range of scientific discovery and the increasing sense on the part of many 

intellectuals that the key to truth lay in science (not faith or tradition) 

was a fundamental change that no other scientific endeavor in other 

societies matched.  
D. If we combine science with printing and growing literacy rates, we 
could argue that of the three areas we have emphasizedŠ

commercialization, political change, and cultureŠit is culture that 

makes Western Europe stand out from other societies.  
E. The other intriguing aspect of cultural change in early modern Europe 
was the degree to which it penetrated into relatively prosaic activities 

and into the attitudes of relatively ordinary people. Between about 1600 and 1700, people had vastly diffe
rent responses to ordinary 
situations, such as losing a valued object, naming a child, or embarking 

on marriage. 
F. Fundamental shifts in Western culture yielded impressive and varied 
expressions at the level of popular beliefs and practices, affecting the 

sense of the individual, the sense of family and community, and 

attitudes toward risk and nature.  
VI. Western Europe, despite all the exciting things happening there, was not the 
only place in the world.  A. Many regions continued to ignore developments in the West, and some 
areas, by coincidence, saw a few developments that were not unlike 
those occurring in the West.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
50 B. Nonetheless, the changes that occurre
d in the West in the early modern 
centuries have three final implications. 
1. The big changes we have seenŠgovernments taking on new roles, 
new attitudes toward nature, and even new attitudes toward 
childrenŠalmost guaranteed that additional changes would occur 

in the West. Of course, the in
creasing pace of commercialization 
set the fundamental framework here. 
2. These changes would color European reactions to other societies. 
Europeans would think of other places as uncivilized because they did not measure up to Europe™s new standards. 
3. The developments that occurred in the West set a challenging 
target for other societies. The complexity of the Western model 

would affect responses to Wester
n activities in the wider world as well.  Further Reading: Charles Tilly,

changes in commerce, politics, and popular culture? 
2. Compared to other major agricultural civilizations by the 18
th century, such as China or the Middle East, what was unusual and what was fairly standard

51Lecture Twenty-Two 
 The Rise of Russia  Scope: Russia poses a bit of a problem for world historians. Is it a civilization 
all its own or part of a slightly larger East European civilization? 
Should it be handled, as is commonly the case in European history 

texts, as part of Europe, though not a leading part? And how important 

is Russia? Developments in the early modern period, crucial in Russian 

history per se, suggest the need to treat Russia separately but with a 

clear asterisk; they also suggest the importance of Russian expansion 

on the world history stage. Early modern Russia warrants attention as 

an unusually durable example of the phenomenon of gunpowder 

empires; as a society increasingly 
influential in Middle Eastern and 

Asian, as well as European, history; 
and as a first instance of selective Westernization, an example of a pattern that would resound more 
widely in world history later on, providing, among other things, a 
comparative benchmark.  
 Outline I. The early modern centuries saw a signifi
cant rise of Russia in world affairs, along with important changes in Russi
an political and cultural patterns.  A. Categorizing Russia is a bit of a problem for world historians.  
 1. In these lectures, we have defined Russia and, possibly, a larger 
Eastern European zone as a distinct civilization, although new 

relationships Russia developed with the West in the early modern 

period blur this distinction somewhat. 
 2. An East European zone existed beyond Russia™s bordersŠsharing 
with Russia, in some cases, commitment to Orthodox Christianity 
and to some common agricultural systems. 
II. The primary Russian theme in this period was territorial expansion.  
A. Between 1450 and 1750, Russian territory expanded steadily in several 
directions, not yet reaching its current dimensi
ons but, without question, creating a substantial gunpowder empire. 
B. One factor that pushed Russia to expansion was the desire to drive the 
Mongols further away.  
C. Russia was also driven by the idea of
 itself as the heir to the Byzantine 
Empire.  
D. Along with this notion was some sense of a religious mission. Russia 
frequently insisted that it had a role to play in the Middle East in 
defense of Christianity, especially Orthodox Christianity.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
52 E. As the early modern period progressed, the Russian state and 
individual groups, such as the Cossacks, also developed a direct stake 
in expansion. Expansion was one of the ways in which the tsars could 

justify their rule; other groups sought new opportunities to obtain land. F. Expansion took several directions. 
The most important expansion was 
southward into Central Asia and to the borders of the Ottoman Empire. 

Here, Russia began to influence world affairs in fundamental ways.  
1. By the 17
th and 18th centuries, Russian-Ottoman conflict 
increasingly moved to the advant
age of the Russians. Russia was involved in pushing the Ottoman Empire back, gaining new 
territories to the south and the southeast in the process. 
2. Russian expansion also eliminated Central Asia and its nomadic 
groups as an independent factor in Eurasian affairs. Russian 

expansion, along with Chinese and Ottoman expansion, 

increasingly placed most of Centra
l Asia under the control of an organized state. 3. Russian expansion began to produce a Muslim minority in Russia. 
Although Russia cast itself as a European state, the tsar presented 
himself as a ruler who operated in a Muslim tradition. 
G. The second direction of Russian expansion was westward, when Russia 
began to move into Ukraine and other territories that brought it directly 
into East-Central Eu
ropean affairs.  1. By the end of the 17
th century, Russia played a role in military and 
diplomatic interactions with such countries as Sweden, Prussia, 
and Austria-Hungary. After about 1750, Russia would assume a 

more general role in European diplomacy. 
2. This push westward brought ne
w minorities into Russian rule, 
including Jews and German ethnic minorities. 
H. The third direction of Russian expansion was eastward, across the Ural 
Mountains into Siberia and, ultimately, even beyond. By the 18th century, this move brought Russia into direct contact with China.  
1. The mid-18
th-century Amur River Treaty established a border 
between China and Russia that indicated the extent to which Russia was now a minor player in East Asian affairs. 
2. During the 18
th century, Russia pressed beyond East Asia into 
Alaska, and Russian explorers moved south from Alaska into 
present-day northern California.  
3. Russian trading expeditions even
 reached the northernmost island 
of Hawaii. I. By 1750, Russia had one of the largest landmasses under single rule 
that had ever existed. This expansion established Russia as a 

multinational society at the same time that Western Europe was 

emphasizing the nation state. This multinational quality would be both 

a strength of and a challenge to Russia from this point onward.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
53J. This expansion also established Russia as a frontier society, 
particularly in the East but also in parts of Central Asia. 
III. Two devices were used in the early modern period to hold the Russian 
territory together. 
A. The first device was the strong assertion of the power of the central 
state and its ruler, the tsar, but state authority was often hollow.  
B. The second device was, essentially, an agreement between the state and 
the landlord class.  
 1. Both big landlords and gentry-level landlords were given 
increasing political and economic 
powers to run local courts, administer justice, punish criminals, levy taxes, and require 
labor service from serfs. 
 2. This decentralization into esta
te-based management gave Russia 
the opportunity to establish at least some political stability even 
in its huge new territories. 
C. Once in a while, this agreement between the tsar and his nobles broke 
down and trouble ensued. For the most part, however, the agreement 

held steady because both parties had a stake in preserving this system. 
IV. In the later-17
th century, Russia embarked on another important pattern of 
change: Westernization.  
A. Peter the Great decided that to maintain Russia™s military mission and 
to further Russia™s goals of becoming a European power, significant 
changes had to occur involving Russia™s imitation of patterns then 

visible in the West.  
B. Westernization reforms under Peter t
ook several directions. One set of 
changes was what we might call cosmetic. 
1. Peter insisted that his nobles trim off their Mongol-like beards and 
adopt Western dress, rather than Asian. 
2. Western cultural institutions were imported into Russia, notably, 
the ballet.  
3. These various changes added up to a major effort to alter Russia™s 
cultural orientation in significant directions. 
C. The second set of changes involved efforts to improve Russian 
education, particularly for the upper classes, and scientific work.  

1. Under Peter, new scientific academies and universities were 
established, including the State University of St. Petersburg.  
2. All nobles were to receive traini
ng in mathematics; they would not 
be allowed to marry if they did not obtain an educational 
certificate.  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
54 D. The third set of changes was political and fairly straightforward. Peter 
developed somewhat more specia
lized bureaucratic services and created a state counsel to oversee bureaucratic activities. E. Peter instituted significant, though 
not uniform, military and economic 
changes.  1. He established a Russian navy, importing Western artisans and 
advisors to do so. He tried to improve the armament of the Russian 
army, and reorganized the army in
to somewhat clearer categories 
of command along partially Western lines. 
2. He also organized the Russian metallurgical industry, taking 
advantage of Russia™s holdings in iron ore to build an economic 

basis for independent weapons productions and to equip Russia™s 

armies without having to rely on Western imports.  
V. What were the goals of Peter™s program of Westernization? 
A. The first goal was to enhance the power
 of the tsar and the state in what was still a fairly ineffective state apparatus. 
B. The second goal was to enhance the 
power of the Russian military so 
that it could play a role in European affairs and would have an edge in 

its military conflicts elsewhere, specifically, with the Ottoman Empire. 
C. The third goal was to address what one might call an embarrassment 
factor with Russia vis-à-vis the West.  
1. Peter assumed that interchange between Russia and the West 
would become more frequent and that, without some changes, 
Russia would be viewed by Westerners as barbaric and backward.  
2. One way to deal with this problem was to make at least upper-class 
Russia look increasingly Western. 
VI. Equally important, however, was what Peter the Great did not Westernize.  
A. He did not import Western ideas 
about constitutional monarchy, the 
parliamentary tradition, or the division of powers.  
B. Peter was not interested in any 
significant reforms that affected 
ordinary Russians.  
 1. He did not ameliorate the conditions of the serfs, nor did he 
institute a wage labor economy in Russia.  
 2. He did not try to bring cultural or
 educational change to ordinary 
Russians.  C. Perhaps most revealing of all, Peter clearly did not want to make 
Russia a commercial economy in the Western model. If we go back to 

the terms of the world economy, Peter™s goal was to maintain Russia as 

an external economy, capable of producing what it needed for its own 

economic operation and for its e
xpanding military activity but not 
seeking commercial dominance over areas outside of Russia. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
55VII.  The Westernization program was quite real, but ironically enhanced some 
of Russia™s differences with the West.  
A. Russia joined Western cultural life, and Peter the Great was obviously 
eager to further Russia™s role as a European diplomatic and military 
player, but he was not interested 
in creating a Western society.  
B. In confirming or widening the gap between ordinary Russians and the 
upper classes, Peter created circumstances that were quite different 

from those of the West and would have different outcomes later. 
C. Peter™s changes had at least two 
unintended consequences that, from 
this point onward, would inform Russian affairs and continue to 

differentiate Russia from the West while also connecting it to the West 

without any question.  
1. After Peter™s death, Orthodox clergy and some landlords voiced 
concerns about the implications of Westernization; the result was 
an ongoing ambivalence about what Russia™s relationship with the 

West should be. 
2. Although Peter intended for Russia to remain an external 
economy, his actions encouraged involvement in the European-

dominated economy on terms that were not favorable to Russia. 

The desire for Western goods pushe
d Russia into the position of a peripheral economy, emphasizing timber, minerals, and grains in 

its exports and depending on serf labor. 
D. Westernization probably did help maintain the military strength of the 
Russian imperial experiment, but it also set in motion other currents 

that would have further effects on Russia™s relationship with the wider 

worldŠsometimes fostering new links, particularly with the West, but 

sometimes creating new tensions as well.

2. Why and how did serfdom become a dominant issue in Russian history?

56 Lecture Twenty-Three 
 Asian Empires and a Shogunate  Scope: Key changes marked the experien
ce of the leading Asian societies during the early modern centuries, changes that had little to do with 
developments in the West or Russia. The Asian continent, although 

involved in the world economy, was long buffered from its worst 

pressures. The formation of new empiresŠthe Ottoman, the Safavid, 

and the MughalŠbrought significant cultural and political changes. In China, a more familiar dynastic cycle saw the Ming rise and decline, to 

be replaced by the nation™s final dynasty, the Qing. By the 18th century, however, several of the Asian gunpowder empires were faltering. The 

Mughal Empire was in serious trouble, though technically it survived 

into the 19
th century. The Ottoman Empire passed its expansionist 
prime in the 17
th century, though it retained great power. The situation 
in China was more complex, but there were signs of new difficulties by 

the 18
th century. Each imperial pattern had its own dynamic and 
characteristics, but it is legitimate to ask if there were some shared 

issues. Finally, Japan, though not an empire, experienced significant 

change as well, important at the time and for the future. 
 Outline I. Lumping together the Asian societies in the early modern period is 
presumptuous.  
A. The territory of Asian civilization is huge, encompassing a number of 
different societies, but a few generalizations are possible to help round 
out our understanding of the early modern centuries.  
B. Contrary to longstanding presumptions, most Asian societies in this 
period were actively engaged in wi
der connections in the world, 
although on different terms from those that operated in the West.  
II. We can identify two major developments in Asian societies during the early 
modern period.  
A. The first development was increasing prosperity, at least for some 
groups, as a result of Asia™s participation in production for world 
markets in exchange for American silver. This participation confirms, 
among other things, an interest in export-based manufacture in parts of 

China and an interest in transmission to world markets in India. 
B. The second development was the emergence of a series of gunpowder 
empires in much of the Asian landmass.  
1. The Ottoman Empire began to take shape in the middle of the 15
th century and extended its hold over much of southeastern Europe. It 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
57developed significant holdings in much of the Middle East, 
extended its direct control to Egypt, and had some nominal control 

over other parts of North Africa, though not Morocco. 
2. The Mughal Empire emerged in India in the early-16
th century as a result of invasions from a force that operated through Afghanistan.  
3. The Safavid Empire in Persia was a smaller gunpowder empire 
that helped revive a sense of Persian identity and presence and 

maintained significance for a couple of centuries. 
C. China, where the imperial tradition was well established, operated 
according to a somewhat different rh
ythm. Much of the early modern 
period saw the operation of the Ming dynasty, followed by the Qing 

dynasty, which had some elements of gunpowder empire attached to it, 

as well.  1. The Qing had been organized by Manchurians coming in from 
northern China and remained partially outside Chinese culture. 
2. This element was not dissimilar to other gunpowder empires, in 
which an intrusion from outside helped to shape the imperial 
experience more generally. 
III. These empires had significant accomp
lishments, although they were not 
quite as dynamic as those occurring in Western Europe.  
A. Asian power began to decline a bit in this period if measured against 
European power. The longstanding trend in which technological 
leadership and innovation centered in Asia, particularly East Asia, and 

tended to move westward began to shift toward greater Western parity 

and even slight leadership. B. The Ottoman Empire brought a number of developments to the Middle 
East and southeastern Europe, solidifying and highlighting a new 

Turkish presence in the northern Middle East. But Ottoman 

administration was never purely Turkish: it incorporated a number of 

other peoples, including non-Muslims.  
1. The Ottoman Empire helped encour
age the spread of Islamic belief 
to parts of southeastern Europe, although Christian groups were, 
for the most part, tolerated. 
2. The Ottoman regime also confirmed a dependent and inferior 
political status for Arabs. 
3. The Ottoman Empire introduced cultural changes into the Middle 
East: a form of mosque developed that blended Byzantine 
architectural forms with Muslim needs; Ottoman contributions to 

literature and art, often in Arabic, were also significant. 
C. Mughal contributions to India were numerous. At its high point, the 
Mughal Empire encompassed a system of considerable tolerance and a 

mixture of Hindus and Muslims. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
58 1. The Mughals introduced additi
onal cultural richness into the Indian tradition, including Persian and Western artistic influences 
as well as important individual symbols such as the Taj Mahal.  
2. The Mughals promoted the possibility
 of creating larger territorial units in the Indian subcontinent, which would feed directly into 

Indian unity after the passing of British rule.  
3. The Mughals developed administrative and taxation structures that 
had lasting impact in India.  
4. The Mughals were interested 
in reforming certain traditional 
Indian practices, such as the practice of sati, though results here 
were meager. 
D. Developments in Safavid Persia included a revival of a sense of Persian 
identity. It was under the Safavid Empi
re, for example, that Farsi was 
established as the dominant language of the region. 
E. Developments in Qing China included economic prosperity and the re-
elaboration of the bureaucratic imperial state. Significant population 

expansion occurred under the very late Ming dynasty and the Qing.  
F. During much of the early modern period, Asian empiresŠlargely 
independent of Western influence in any cultural or political senseŠ

made important achievements that would outlast the empires 

themselves. 
IV. Some of the gunpowder empires began to show signs of wear as early as 
the late-17
th or early-18th centuries.  A. The Safavid Empire began to weaken in the early-18
th century, and the Mughal Empire began to weaken even somewhat earlier. If their goal 

was to preserve Indian vitality and Mughal rule, then later-17th-century Mughal emperors made two mistakes. 
1. Several later emperors began to
 reverse the policy of religious 
tolerance, clearly favoring Muslims in administration and creating 
an atmosphere of religious mistrust. 
2. The second mistake was overexpansion. The attempt to press 
Mughal boundaries southward led to significant military 
expenditure at the expense of the taxation base and the basic 

economic vitality of India as a whole.  
B. By the 18
th century, Mughal hold over India began to fade in favor of 
local princes, and Indian economic prosperity declined. It was in this 

context that European powers, ultimately led by the English, began to 

interfere in Indian affairs. 1. The British East India Company took advantage of Mughal 
weakness to establish a beachhead on the continent.  2. The later-18
th century saw the increasing conversion of much of 
India to, essentially, a British colony. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
59C. The Ottoman Empire presents a diffe
rent picture. This regime reached 
a high point in the late-16
th and 17th centuries. A last effort at territorial expansion occurred in the 1680s, as Ottoman troops twice attacked 
Vienna, hoping to press farther into Central Europe. These attacks 

failed and, from that point onward, the Ottomans suffered territorial 

setbacks. 1. These setbacks pressed the empires in other ways: It became 
harder to reward loyal bureaucrats and generals. Many parts of the 
empire were parceled out among chief administrators who might 

meld the provinces for personal advantage. Corruption and 

economic dislocation increased. 
2. Nonetheless, the Ottoman Empire remained healthy well into the 
19th century. 3. By the 18
th century, sensing Ottoman weakness and undoubtedly 
exploiting an older prejudice against Islam, European opinion 

began to hold that Ottoman rule was both sick and weak. This 

perception would create a reality of its own during the 19
th century and affect Europe™s relations with the Middle East. 
D. Developments in China were much more complex. In most 
fundamental respects, the Chinese state and economy remained 

vigorous up until the 1830s, but there were some modest signs of 

trouble.  
1. Probably by the 18
th century, China began to be burdened by 
overpopulation that would affect larger economic dynamism and 
growth. 
2. At the same time, China ceased being a source of major 
technological innovation, and cultural creativity lagged.  
3. The empire may also have 
been affected by excessive bureaucratization that made decision-making difficult and 

communication with the provinces cumbersome. 
V. These empires, particularly China and the Ottoman Empire, did not look to 
selective developments in the West as a model for certain reforms, as 
Russia had done.  
A. China had been open to modest Western activity in much of the early 
modern period, but this openness turned sour in the early-18
th century. Participation in trade remained vigorous, but there was, if anything, a 
withdrawal from an interest in contacts of other sorts. 
B. The Ottoman Empire rather systematically avoided the possibility of 
influential imports from the West.  
1. The printing press was banned from the empire until the middle of 
the 18
th century, when it was first allowed only for Christians, not 
Muslims. This was an obvious attempt by the government to

60 2. The only Western influence directly incorporated by Ottoman 
rulers, interestingly enough, was 
Western doctors, who were called 
upon to service the Ottoman court. 
C. For most of the early modern period, significant achievements were 
registered in Asia, but these gains were somewhat overshadowed by 
the greater vigor of developments in the West. 
VI. Japan contrasts to some extent with the developments in the gunpowder 
empires we have seen thus far. 
A. The early modern period was a crucial one in Japanese history. After 
some flirtation with Western contacts,
 Japanese leaders decided at the end of the 16
th century to close off contacts and emphasize internal 
economic, political, and cultural development.  
B. This period became known as th
e Tokugawa shogunate, which would last until 1868.  1. Under the shogunate, the ritual apparatus of feudalism was 
carefully preserved, along with the social privileges of feudal 
lords. 
 2. Alongside feudalism was the apparatus of a small but definite 
central state.  3. The shogunate was the framework for the successful expansion of 
commercial activity in Japan. 
C. The Japanese turned increasingly to Confucianism during the early 
modern period.  
1. As Confucianism spread, this-worldly concerns began to 
predominate in Japanese culture, along with new artistic forms that 
would mark further steps in Japanese cultural identity. 
2. Japan also saw an increasing comm
itment to education, not just for 
the upper class but for broader bands of society. Over time, 

Japanese Confucianism encouraged an educational commitment 

that would position Japan as the second society, after the West, in 

literacy rates by the early-19
th century.  D. The Japanese population did not grow massively during the 18
th century. The fairly extensive use of abortion, among other things, 

seems to have limited Japanese population growth.  
E. Also important for the future of Japan was the tendency in the 18
th century to become slightly more open to outside influences. This 

interest indicated that the Japanese 
were aware of developments in the 
outside world and saw a need to find out what these developments 

might portend. 
VII.  The patterns we have discussed in th
is lecture do not overturn conventional 
views of Asian history in the early modern period entirely.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
61A. Relative decline is undeniable, but it must not overwhelm our 
understanding that important positiv
e developments took place during 
much of this period.  
B. At the same time, we should note the decline of specific regimes, most 
notably in Mughal India. But the sense that Asia began to be backward 
or isolated in this period is simply wrong.  
C. World historians, particularly experts on Asia and the world economy, 
have insisted that we need to redress this impression of Asian 
economic inferiority and backwardness. 
1. One reason for this insistence is, presumably, that it is better to be 
accurate than not.  2. Another reason is that our misguided impressions pander to older 
Western prejudices about Asian characteristics. 
3. Asia remained a vital contributor to world history up until at least 
the 18
th century and even into the 19th and would again become a 
vital contributor by the 20
th century.   Further Reading: Rifa™at Abou-El-Haj,

some cases, avoiding Western patterns of change in the early modern 
period? 
2. Why and in what ways was Mughal decline more serious than the issues 
emerging in other Asian societies by the 18
th century?

62 Lecture Twenty-Four 
 The Long 19th Century 
 Scope: World histories usually mark a new period in the later-18
th century, contending that even though not all the themes are entirely new, there 
is enough change to warrant separate treatment. We look then to a 

period running from around the 1750s to World War I, which historian 

Eric Hobsbawm has dubbed ﬁthe Long 19
th Century.ﬂ This new period 
saw the decline or disappearance of most of the earlier land-based 
empires in favor of a simpler pattern of ascendant European 

imperialism. Europe™s growing world dominance correspondingly 

redefined the world economy, whic
h for a few decades balanced between a European (and U.S.) core and the peripheralization of almost 

every other region. The overwhelming new fact was the steadily 

growing manufacturing and military mi
ght of Europe, soon intensified by the results of the Industrial Revolution. Industrialization displaced much regional manufacturing in favor of European imports and 

generated changes in military t
echnology that not only increased Europe™s superiority on the seas but added ready dominance on land, as 
well. Around the edges of Europe™s industrial dominance, two other 
themes began to emerge: first, a pattern of selective imitation of certain 

European developments that might be called the beginnings of 

modernization, copying elements of technology or education, for 

example, while retaining distinctiv
e political forms; and second, the 
emergence of new levels of international connection under Western 

control that might be called a first stage of contemporary globalization. 
 Outline I. The British historian Eric Hobsbawm 
called the period that runs from about 
1750 to 1914 the Long 19
th Century.  
A. Two features of the early modern period, the Colombian exchange and 
the land-based gunpowder empires, no longer had much impact in 

world affairs in the Long 19
th Century. 
B. At the same time, two themes of the early modern period persist in this 
period.  
 1. The rise of the West, which continued and even accelerated 
compared to other societies. 
 2. The clearer shape of the world economy. 
C. The two big developments that framed the Long 19
th Century are the emergence of the Industrial Revolution and its brief but decisive 

monopoly by the West.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
631. The Industrial Revolution introduced a new economic form as 
decisively different from agricu
lture as agriculture was from 
hunting and gathering.  
2. Almost every aspect of life was touched by the Industrial 
Revolution as it began to take shape, first in Britain, then in other 
parts of Western Europe and the United States in the late-18
th and early-19th centuries. D. The Long 19
th Century is also shaped by the extent to which Western 
societies monopolized the industria
lization process. Ultimately, 

industrialization was a global phenomenon, but for the Long 19
th Century itself, the enhancement of European power by industrialization 

set a framework to which ev
ery society had to react. II. Even in its European monopoly, the Industrial Revolution was already, in 
crucial ways, global. 
A. Europeans industrialized in part b
ecause they had already learned that an emphasis on producing processed goods was the way to make 
money in the world economy. Producing processed goods in factories 
simply enhanced and augmented that advantage.  
B. Global relationships had also helped pile up capital in European coffers 
that was now available for investment in industrial apparatuses. 
C. Industrialization had a global impact almost immediately, for example, 
in causing the deindustrialization of local industries in such places as India and Latin America.  
 1. As British, European, and Amer
ican factories poured out cheap manufactured goods, hundreds of thousands of domestic workers 
in Venezuela, India, and elsewhere were thrown out of work, forcing crucial economic adjustments in these regions.  
III. Industrialization and European monopoly shaped the period in crucial 
respects.  A. As Europe industrialized, it enhanced its demands on other parts of the 
world to produce cheap raw materials and foods and to accept 
manufactured products. In other words, it increased the extent to which 

core and peripheral or somewhat 
peripheral relationships began to 
predominate, not just in the Atlantic economy but worldwide.  
1. Latin America, for example, already a peripheral economy, saw 
more land and more workers devoted to production for export.  
2. Products here (such as silver, s
ugar, coffee, rubber, and fertilizer) still depended on low cost and yielded a modest profit to the 
society as a whole.  B. As this relationship between Europe and other parts of the world was 
extended, the gap between core societies and peripheral societies 

widened as well.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
64 C. Africa was now deeply affected by the world economy. 
1. The slave trade was abolished in the 19
th century, significantly limiting the principal African product in the world economy; yet 
African attachment to European
 goods continued, resulting in a scramble to identify other products that might sell in the world 

market, such as vegetable oil, palm oil, or cotton. 
2. These products, not always suitable to the African environment, 
required larger amounts of cheap labor, such that, ironically, 

slavery actually expanded in 19
th-century Africa itself. D. Every part of the world was touched by this relationship, either 
becoming peripheral or expanding peripheral characteristics. 
IV. Another consequence of this new pattern was an extension of European or 
Western military advantage from the seas to the land. 
A. Sea-based power was the dominant source of Western military threat in 
the early modern period, and it remained crucial. 
B. However, a series of developments opened up the possibility of land-
based military dominance. These i
nnovations included the development 
of smaller, more mobile field artillery; the invention of the repeating 
rifle and the possibility of producing it on a mass scale; and the 
emergence of early forms of the machine gun. 
C. Land-based military advantage was also enhanced by transportation 
improvements such as steamships and, in a few cases, railroads, along 
with the telegraph.  
D. Finally, the development of new tropical medicines was an aid to 
Western military interaction in key parts of the world.  
V. The new Western military edge was demonstrated in a series of major crises 
that quickly turned into larger patterns of economic exploitation.  
A. The first crisis took place in 
1798, when Napoleon invaded and conquered Egypt.  
 1. Although the British soon ousted th
e French, the ease with which European forces could conquer one of the heartland areas of the 
Islamic world was not lost on the Egyptians or the Ottomans.  
 2. The balance between European military authority and Middle 
Eastern military power had been dramatically altered.  
B. The second crisis was the first Opium War in China in 1839, in which 
the British insisted that the Chinese accept opium (produced in British territories in India) and open their markets more generally.  
 1. The Chinese government, weak 
now but still with some voice, 
resisted British demands.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
65 2. The result was a conflict in which British and other Western troops 
easily overcame Chinese forces and pried open the market for 
opium and for European and Western activities more generally. 
C. The third crisis took place in 1853, when an American fleet under 
Admiral Perry sailed into Ito Bay in Japan and demanded that the 

Japanese open their markets to Western goods.  
 1. This was followed by another American expedition and a British 
expedition in 1854.  
 2. The Japanese ultimately decided that they had no choice but to 
open their markets. 
D. The fourth crisis arose in 1854Œ1855, as the Russians were poised to 
seize additional Ottoman territory.  
 1. Britain and France objected to Russian expansion and engaged 
Russia in the Crimea.  
 2. Although the conflict was not easy, the West won again, and the 
power of industrial production, transportation, and technology 

applied to military activities made it clear that even Russia was 

behind.  
E. After these crises, there followed a series of military penetrations from 
the 1860s onward in Africa, some areas of the Pacific, and elsewhere.  
F. There were few parts of the world that Europe tried to enter militarily 
and failed. In most regions either direct military penetration or the 

threat of such penetration now reshaped the world to the West™s 

advantage. 
VI. The century of imperialism saw a simplification of the world economic 
patterns we have described previously
. Two changes were crucial in this 
simplification: 
A. One, which we have touched on already, was the increasing 
exploitation of the bulk of the world by core societies, now including 
the United States.  B. The second change was the effectiv
e elimination of externality. No 
major society could stay external
 because the West, through military 
pressure or economic cajoling, simply would not allow it.  
VII. This new framework was an intensification of patterns that had been 
sketched, to some degree, in the early modern period, with the addition of 

two or three other components in the Long 19
th Century.  
A. The early part of the Long 19
th Century, in addition to being an age of 
early industrialization and imperialis
tic military activity, was also an 
age of Atlantic revolutions.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
66 B. Beginning in the 1770s, a series of uprisings occurred in various parts 
of the Atlantic world, North America, Western Europe, and Latin 
America that would last through 1849. 
1. The ideological thrusts of these movements brought important 
political ideas onto the world stage, although many of the 
revolutionary ideals sincerely held by Europeans did not fit the 
relationships that Europe was forging in Asia and Africa.  
2. We see a lag between the emergence of revolutionary ideas and 
truly global impact. In the 20
th century, however, reformers would 
use the ideologies of the revolutionary Atlantic world to spur 

national independence movements and social revolutions. 
C. Another new global theme was the need for societies to decide how to 
respond to Western power.  Should societies attempt to resist the West? 

What aspects of Western development could be imitated to regain or 

preserve some degree of regional independence? 
1. In the aftermath of Napoleon™s invasions in Egypt, a new leader 
there, Muhammad Ali, undertook a path of reform that he hoped 
would bring industrialization and modern political and economic 
conditions to Egypt. Unfortunately, Western pressure and the 

limits of resources in Egypt tended to confine the durable results of 
Ali™s reforms to the production of new cash crops that could serve 
the world market.  
2. Slightly later, the Ottoman Empire undertook reforms, with mixed 
results.  
3. Russia™s reforms, beginning with the emancipation of the serfs in 
1861, enabled that nation™s participation in the industrialization 

process by the 1890s.  
D. Western power affected different regions differently.  
 1. Some areas, such as India and, in
creasingly, Africa, were held as outright colonies. 
 2.  Some areas, such as China, were
 simply targets of interference. 
E. The responses of different regions varied. Even at the crest of 
European power we must look at world history in terms of interactions 

and not simply impositions. 
VIII. A subordinate theme of the Long 19
th Century was the tentative 
emergence of international instituti
ons and arrangements that accompanied 
industrialization, and the increasingly global qualities of the world economy.  
A. Soon after the middle of the 19
th century, for example, the Universal 
Postal Union was formed, as was 
the International Red Cross.  
B. Other international agreements allowed technological developments, 
such as the laying of undersea cables. Such agreements were Western 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
67dominated and, in one sense, a facet 
of imperialism itself, but they were 
also preliminary hints of a partial international political structure.  
C. International connections were fu
rthered by the development of new 
transportation arrangements, including the cutting of the Suez and 
Panama canals.  
D. The 1880s saw the emergence of a series of private, international, 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) dealing with such issues as 

women™s rights and white slavery.  
IX.
 New patterns of cultural contacts are intriguing at the end of the Long 19
th Century.  
A. The first sign of the potential for what we would now call a global 
consumer culture emerged in
 the final decade of the 19th century with 
the internationalization of several Western sports, including soccer and 
American baseball.  
B. This seemingly trivial development 
points to a final facet of the Long 19th Century: beneath the surface of exploitation and imperialism, new 
kinds of global connections and contacts were emerging. Some of these 
were institutional and some were evidence of international cultural 

interactions that help shape the next period in world history. 
X. Let us close with a note on the brevity of the Long 19
th Century.  
A. The Long 19
th Century is a story of Western dominance, which makes 
this period, at least superficially, seem unusually simple.  
B. The reason we end the period in 
1914 is not only because that date marks the beginning of World War I, 
but also because, as a result of World War I, the easy Western dominance in the world began to come 

to an end.  Further Reading: Peter N. Stearns, The Industrial Revolution in World History

.  Questions to Consider: 1. Why was it difficult for non-European societies to match European 
economic and military achie
vements during the Long 19
th Century? Why 
was it hard to industrialize? 
2. If one compares India to the Ottoman Empire or China, was it more or less 
advantageous to be a European colony as opposed to a target of European 
interference during the 19
th century?

1A Brief History of the World 
 Scope: This course presents some of the highlights of the world historical approach to 
the past, suggesting major changes in the framework of the human experience, 

from the rise of agriculture 
to the present day. The lectures cover the emergence 
of distinct major societies as they deal with common problems but generate 

quite different institutional and cultural approaches. The course also discusses 

key changes in belief systemsŠthe emer
gence and spread of the great world religions, for exampleŠas well as alterations in trading patterns and basic shifts 

in technology, exploring why some societies reacted
 differently to technological change than others.  
Throughout the course, we will look at many
 parts of the world, including those clustered into shared civilizations. East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and 
the Mediterranean loom large from the 
start. Sub-Saharan Africa, where the human species originated, has also played
 a great role in world history, as 
ultimately did northern Europe, including Russia. The Americas offer an 

important variant until their incorpora
tion in global patterns from 1492 onward. 
Central Asia maintained a distinct position in world history until the 16
th century. World history divides into a limited number of time periods, defined in terms of 
dominant themes. The rise of agriculture requires a discussion of pre-

agricultural patterns. Following agriculture came, in several places, the advent 
of civilization as a form of human organization. The classical period in world 

history draws attention to China, India, Persia, and the Mediterranean, when the 

expansion and integration of these large societies dominated over a millennium 

of human history. The collapse of the classical empires ushered in a vital 

postclassical period, when emphasis shifted to religion but also to more 

ambitious patterns of interregional trade. It was in this postclassical period 
(500Œ1500 CE) that the emphasis of major societies shifted from separate 
development to greater interaction a
nd even deliberate imitation. The early 
modern period highlights a renewed capacity for empire, the inclusion of the 

Americas in global systems, andŠthough this must be handled with a bit of 

careŠthe rise of Western Europe. What some historians call the Long 19
th CenturyŠ1750 or so to 1914Šwas dominated by Western industrialization and 

its economic, military, and cultural impact 
on, literally, the entire world. Finally, the contemporary period in world history, after World War I, features a 

bewildering variety of themes that must be sorted out, with emphasis among 

other things on the relative decline of the West, the huge surge in human 

population, and the potential for greater globalization.  
World history highlights a number of major regions, but it avoids simply 
examining one area after anotherŠﬁif it™s Tuesday, this must be Latin 

AmericaﬂŠby making careful compar
isons and focusing on interregional  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
2 contacts. The discipline emphasizes a number of key time periods (though not 
an indefinite number), defined in terms of basic changes in the ways many 

societies operated, whether the change is in an economic systemŠ

industrialization, for exampleŠor a cultural system, as seen, for example, in the 

emergence of vigorous missionary religions. 
World history also embraces two common 
themes. First, and most obviously, is 
the eternal tension between change and continuityŠthe stuff of history as a 
discipline. Particularly once the classical traditions are defined, world history 
can be seen in terms of new forces being met and interpreted by established 

cultural and institutional systems. Of course, these systems change but never 

completely and never in exactly the same ways from one society to the next. 
The second theme involves a perpetual interplay between local or regional 
identities, on the one hand, and the attraction or simple inevitability of wider 

contacts, on the other. Societies began trading at long distances several 

millennia ago. They received immigrants
 and diseases and, sometimes, ideas 
from distant places. But they rarely, at 
least willingly, simply surrendered to 
outside influence, and sometimes they battled fiercely against such influence in 

the name of established values. Over time, of course, and particularly with 

contemporary globalization, the pendulum shifted toward more outside 

influence, either willingly embraced or endured of necessity. But the tension has 
not ended, and assertions of regional identities can intensify precisely because the external framework is so intrusive. 
World history allows us to trace the main 
iterations of this tension and to place its current iteration in contextŠand even, tentatively, to talk about its future.

3Lecture Twenty-Five 
 Abolition of Slavery and Serfdom 
 Scope: Formal systems of coercive labor, often reflecting very old social 
inventions of human societies, were largely abolished around the world 
during the Long 19
th Century. This was a major change, reflecting a 
variety of new forces in world history and unleashing important new 

patterns. In some ways, the change
 was unexpected in a century that saw growing levels of economic exploitation in many regional 

economies. Not surprisingly, the a
bolition movements have occasioned 
great debate. New humanitarian thinkingŠarguably, the first global 

human rights movementŠwas an undeniable factor, and the response 

of many societies to this Western-centered international pressure was 

interesting in its own right. But changes in world demography and 
migration must also be consideredŠthis was not simply a selfless 
movement. Assessing the long-term results of this historic change is 
correspondingly intriguing and complex. 
 Outline I. One of the major changes of the Long 19
th Century was the abolishment of 
formal slavery throughout the world.  
A. The fact that this deve
lopment occurred in the 19
th century seems, in 
some ways, counterintuitive. After all,
 this century saw an increase in exploitive economic practices, the 
extension of the world economy, 
and efforts to induce peripheral societies to produce goods cheaply.  
B. In charting the end of slavery, we
 will look at the issue of causation, particularly in light of slavery™s deep roots and the exploitive economic 
relationships that dominated other aspects of world history in this 
period. 
C. We will discuss the process of 
abolition, which stretched from 1808 
into the 20
th century. D. We will look at the consequences
 of abolition, which were messy, 
diverse, and global.   
II. Arguments against slavery began to
 take shape at the end of the 18th century. A. Two sources for these arguments 
predominated in such places as 
England, the Netherlands, France, Scandinavia, and British North 
America. 
1. One source encompassed maverick or new Protestant religious 
groups, such as Methodists and Quakers.

4 2. The other source was Enlightenment thinking, which stressed the 
fundamental equality of all human beings. Enlighten
ment thinkers 
also put forth the utilitarian argument that slavery was inefficient. 
B. Agitation in antislavery was not a constant force from the late-18
th to 
the early-19th centuries, but periodically, waves of outrage would 
develop.  
1. Petitions against slavery were signed in England and elsewhere. 
2. Plays, pamphlets, and literary materials such as 
Uncle Tom™s Cabin
 attempted to educate people about the evils of slavery.  
3. Ineffective boycotts against such goods as sugar were planned. 
C. Principles of the French Revolu
tion also argued against slavery.  D. During the 1790s, the Haitian Revol
ution, a rebellion against both French colonial control and slavery illustrated the capacity of former 
slaves to rise against the institution and build a new society. 
E. Some historians have identified 
the innovation in these abolitionist activities as a new kind of humanitarian thinking.  
1. The key principle here was that moral concern should extend to 
distant situations and to people 
who were different from oneself, 
even those of different religions. 
2. This concern about morality spr
ead to other areas, for example, 
Russian serfdom. 
III. The pattern of abolition and emancipation was gradual and varied. 
A. The French Revolution abolished serfdom permanently in much of 
Western Europe, and this abolition would extend into central Germany 
and Austria through the revolutions of 1848.  
B. Britain sponsored an abolition of th
e Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and in such colonies as Jamaica in 1833. The French Revolution of 1848 

extended the attack on slavery in the French colonies. C. In some of the Latin American 
independence wars in the early-19
th century (for example, in Mexico), the abolition of slavery was part of 

the process of revolt. In the larger slaveholding societies in Latin 

America, however, emancipation 
occurred noticeably later.  D. Russia moved against serfdom in 1861. The argument for emancipation 
here was humanitarian in part, but a more pragmatic motive was 

involved as well.  
IV. The question of why abolition occurred at this time is not easy to answer.  
A. The emergence of humanitarian arguments and campaigns played a 
role in abolitionist movements. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
5B. The argument that slavery and harsh serfdom were found to be 
uneconomical at the time is proba
bly incorrect; slavery was still economically effective in producing sugar and cotton.  
C. Some scholars have argued that some of the moral fervor devoted to 
attacks on slavery was designed to distract industrial workers in 
northern England and elsewhere from their plight.  
D. Another factor that must be considered is the concern about slave 
revolts or individual acts of defiance.
 But except in a few instances, as in Haiti, the abolition of slavery did not directly result from slave 
protests. 
E. We should keep in mind the global demographic context in looking for 
reasons for the demise of slavery.  
 1. In the 19
th century, population rates were on the rise, which meant 
that alternatives to slavery were
 now available in terms of cheap 
sources of labor.  
V. Slavery, of course, did not die a painless death. 
A. Slave owners argued fervently to retain the institution, appealing 
especially to property rights. This argument was used by planters in the 
American South and Russian landlords.   
B. American slave owners and Russian 
aristocrats argued that slavery was essential for providing guidance and motivation to childlike peoples.  
VI. Efforts to resist the tide of abolition lost. Slavery and serfdom were 
abolished in the Western world and in territories under Western control by 

the middle of the 19
th century. Slavery and serfdom were abolished in 
Russia and the United States in the 1860s.  
A. Lincoln™s Emancipation Proclamation was certainly motivated by some 
sense of the injustice of slavery but also by world opinion.  
 1. Abolishing slavery in the sece
ssionist states was a means of 
conciliating British and French public opinion, which was otherwise slightly inclined to sympathize with the South against 
the competitive, industrial North.  
B. Slavery was attacked by European 
imperialists as they moved into 
Africa. The ﬁwhite man™s burdenﬂ 
argument viewed imperialism as 
essential to counter the growing use of slavery in the 19
th-century African economy. 
C. The abolition of slavery extended to parts of Latin America, such as 
Brazil in 1882.  
D. Later in the 19
th century and into the early-20
th century, antislavery 
forces began to attack slavery in parts of the Middle East.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
6 E. By about 1923, the formal legal in
stitution of slavery was effectively ended. F. The abolition of serfdom was a little less systematic. In the later 1860s, 
serfdom was abolished in parts of Eastern Europe, such as Romania, in 
the wake of Russian reforms.  
VII.  We can divide the consequences of abolition into four categories. 
A. The immediate results of emancipation were very different. 
1. When slavery was abolished in Jamaica, way stations were 
established, in which former Jamaican slaves might be bound to 
apprenticeships for years. 2. After Russian emancipation of the serfs, a formula was designed to 
give peasants access to land, while preserving the aristocracy. 3. Some have argued that one consequence of the abolition of slavery 
in the Americas was an increase in racism. 
B. Many societies saw efforts to revive conditions that had some 
similarity to slavery. 
1. In Brazil, orphans were brought into the labor force without choice 
and treated as slaves until they became adults. 
2. In the Belgian Congo, African laborers were forced into the mines 
on pain of physical mutilation. 
3. Slave-like conditions might also result from harsh sharecropping 
systems in which people could work the land only if they agreed to 
heavy taxation as a result of their tenure.  
4. In many factories in Mexico and the United States, conditions of 
indebtedness were used to tie workers to the factory owners. 
5. In more recent times, Asian workers in some U.S.-controlled 
Pacific Islands were held under threat of deportation. 
C. With slavery abolished in the Americas, labor needs had to be met by 
immigration. Sources of immigration to Latin America and elsewhere 

included Southern and Eastern Eur
ope, as well as Asia and India. 
D. The moral outrage that had been mobilized against slavery did not end 
with the institution™s abolishment. In the later-19
th century, petitions 
and education campaigns were dir
ected at new evils such as the exploitation of workers in the Belgian Congo or the phenomenon of 

white slavery.  1. By the end of the 19
th century, organizations to mobilize world 
opinion applied their efforts to other situations of perceived 
injustice. 
2. This consequence was of great importance for the 19
th and 20th centuries and is the final legacy of this interesting moment in the 

history of the world in the Long 19
th Century.

8 Lecture Twenty-Six 
 Modernization and Nationalisms  Scope: Developments in the Long 19
th Century divided societies around the 
world in many ways. The deepest division pitted Western Europe and a 
few other wealthy societies, such as the United States, against most of 
the rest of the world, where economic conditions were deteriorating. In 

1800, for example, the average Mexican had a standard of living two-

thirds the level of his U.S. counterpart; in 1900, the ratio stood at one-

third as a result of U.S. gains and Mexican losses. But there were other 

rifts as well. Some regions were held as colonies, the treatment of 

which varied greatly. For all the di
visions, however, there were also a few common trends as societies attempted to respond to Western 

pressure and example. With a great
 deal of caution, some of these 
trends can be seen as the first signs of a global modernization process. 
Three areas warrant particular attention: changes in the military, public 
health, and education. Another common trend, though by definition a 
complicated one, involved the spread of nationalism. European in 
origin, nationalism met a variety of needs in most regions of the world, 

becoming a significant new political 
force by 1900. Figuring out what nationalism meant and how it could vary, for example, between 

reformism and conservatism is a cruc
ial analytical task for modern 
world history.  
 Outline I. We will discuss new divisions in
 world history during the Long 19th Century, some common trends that cut across these divisions, and the 

spread of nationalism. 
II. We have already noted the important division that opened up in the Long 
19th Century between industrialized societies and agricultural societies.  
A. We can also point to a division between societies held as colonies and 
those that remained free.  
 1. While India was held as 
a colony, ChinaŠtechnically independentŠwas increasingly subject to European territorial 

seizures and exploitation.  
B. Even among colonies, however, we find differences. 
1. India fared better under imperialism in the Long 19
th Century than 
Africa did.  
2. Africa was divided among competing 
European states in a race to exploit its territories and resources.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
9III. Along with differential economic cha
nge and differential imperialism came 
the realization of the need for certain reforms.  
A. Some societies realized that as
pects of Western development would 
need to be imitated if they were to gain enough strength to establish or 
retain independence in a world dominated by European political 

control and the control of the industrial zone. 
B. Modernization theory, the brainchild of American sociologists in the 
1950s, argues that, as societies realize the directions of modern 
industrial political states, they begin to change a number of aspects of 
social activity in parallel directions.  
1. According to this theory, societies will begin to move in the same 
basic directions, and connections will be seen among 
developments in intellectual life, family life, and political life.  
2. Economic modernization means that
 societies will become or will 
try to become industrialized. 
3. Political modernization means th
at governments will take on new 
functions, shed older functions, and create larger bureaucracies; 
the result is the creation of a new kind of state whose operation 

parallels the modernization of the economy.  
4. As culture is modernized, science will be emphasized.  
5. Modernization can even apply to 
aspects of family life, where it 
might involve, for example, reduction of the birthrate. 
C. Modernization theory is widely assumed in certain kinds of 
scholarship, but it also has severe limitations.  
1. Critics argue that looking for a singl
e direction in world history in the modern period oversimplifies very complicated patterns, even 
within single societies. 
2. The theory also risks denigrating so
cieties that seem to be slow in 
the modernization process.  
3. Modernization theory does not apply to many areas of social life: it 
doesn™t predict, for example, trends in religion, crime rates, or the 
status of women. 
4. Finally, modernization must be distinguished from mere 
Westernization.  
IV. At the end of the Long 19
th Century and in the early-20
th century, we find common trends in three broad areasŠpublic health, education, and the 

militaryŠin virtually every major society in the world.  
A. Borrowing from Western sanitary ideas and engineering, many 
societies realized that governments 
needed to take responsibility for public health measures, which would result in healthier and more 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
10 rapidly growing populationsŠsources of economic and military 
strength.  
1. Modern public health measures were born in Western Europe in 
the 1830s and 1840s and spread to the United States, Japan, Latin 
America, and elsewhere. 
2. Public health became a concern in
 the urban sectors of virtually every part of the world by the end of the 19
th century, setting the 
stage for the huge global population increase of the 20
th century. B. By 1900, virtually every society in the world was also attempting to 
spread schooling to some sectors of the lower classes and to add 

technical and scientific subjects to the educational agenda.  
1. This might be a massive effort, as in the West or Japan, where by 
the 1890s virtually every child of appropriate age was in school.  
2. Much more gradually, colonial authorities in India and Africa 
began to allow some access to education, sometimes assisted by 
missionary efforts.  
3. China would expand its attention to student life by the 1890s, 
sending students to learn from such societies as Japan, the United 

States, and Western Europe. 
C. Recognizing the now more omi
nous power position of the West, 
societies looked to improve milita
ry technology and copy Western 
military training and officer organization.  
1. Even colonies enhanced the training of troops to provide more 
effective fighting forces.  V. Another phenomenon that spread widely in the 19
th century was the rise of nationalism and nationalist loyalties.  
A. Nationalism is the belief that a society has an identifiable national 
culture that is measurably different from other cultures.  
1. Cultural nationalists often assert that their nation™s culture is better 
than others and may believe that the culture should be connected to 
the state. 2. Nationalists typically argue that recognizable divisions exist 
among peoples based on differe
nt national traditions.  B. Nationalism is a mostly modern phenomenon that contrasts with 
traditional types of loyalty to religion or locality. 
C. Nationalism was born in Europe on the basis of two factors. 
1. Nationalism was an objection to Enlightenment thinking that 
argued that all peoples were fundamentally the same. 
2. Increased population movement and the rise of the new middle 
class created an audience for loyalty to an entity that was larger 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
11than the locality and would help uprooted peoples in the city find a 
sense of identity.  
D. Nationalism received a significant boos
t from the French Revolution.  
 1. By tearing down local institutions and reducing the power of the 
church, the French Revolution 
resulted in the idea that the 

government belonged to the people, who now owed it loyalty. 
E. From Western and Central Europe, nationalism quickly spread in two 
additional directions, visible by the late-18
th and early-19th centuries.  1. It spread to the Americas, b
ecoming more distinct after the 
American Revolution, and to Eastern Europe.  
2. In the Americas, nationalism was primarily used to form new 
states or to undergird new states and identities; in Eastern Europe, nationalism became a force to attack multinational empires. 
F. Nationalism spread to the Middle East by the middle of the 19
th century and to India by the 1880s; from the 1860s to 1900, we see nationalist 

elements in Japan, Russia, Turkey, 
and Africa. In other words, from the 
1750s to 1914, nationalism was effectively created and gained some 

attention in virtually every part of the world. 
VI. What were the implications of nationalism? 
A. As we saw in Europe, nationalism provided new loyalties for people 
who were facing rapid economic and political change.  B. Further, nationalism provided alternatives to traditional loyalties, 
particularly with regard to religion.  
C. Nationalism helped people entertain the possibility of a certain degree 
of change, while insisting that change had to be modified or controlled 
by attachment to tradition. 
D. Nationalists may also argue that in order to express national strength, 
certain kinds of changes are needed, such as more attention to 

industrial development or even changes in styles of dress to appear 

more businesslike. Hence, it could link directly to modernization. 
E. Nationalism was an increasingly important rallying point for many 
peoples around the world against the West; national loyalties united 

people across traditional boundaries of class, caste, or even gender.

13Lecture Twenty-Seven 
 Formation of Latin American Civilization  Scope: Crucial developments occurred in Latin America in the 19
th century. The civilization had already been shaped by the interaction of Spanish/Portuguese, African, and Native American populations during 
the early modern period, in a context dominated by colonialism, the 

Colombian exchange, and Latin America™s peripheral position in the 

world economy. Catholicism had spread widely, though with 

admixtures from traditional cultu
res. The powers of colonial 
governments were limited, though reform efforts in the 18
th century had some effect. The big news in the 19
th century was the establishment of national independe
nce, followed by some revealing 
political problems and a seesaw battle between liberalism and 

conservatism. Formal culture blossomed more fully, linked to Western 

models but with regional themes and flavors. New sources of 

immigration and a growing urban middle class enhanced ties with the 

West, as well. Dependent status in the world economy increased on the 

whole, despite vigorous efforts to the contrary; the growing 

hemispheric power of the United States figured into this mix.  
 Outline I. This lecture focuses on Latin America in the Long 19
th Century. 
A. We have sketched some general patterns of world history in this 
period: the force of the world economy as the West industrialized, the 

limited but measurable development of modernization, the force of 

Western military strength and imperialism, and the spread of national 

loyalties.  
B. In this lecture, we will look at thes
e larger factors in the context of a particular civilization™s experiences.  C. One reason to focus on Latin Ameri
ca is a general concern in world 
history to pay appropriate attention to this region. 
II. From the colonial period, Latin America had developed a number of 
important features. 
A. The Latin American economy depended, in many respects, on that of 
Western Europe through the intermediaries of Spain and Portugal, 
although by the 18
th century, local manufacturing and other economic 
activities had emerged. 
B. Latin America also faced significant 
issues concerning the formation of 
effective governments.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
14 1. Given the facts of colonial control by Spain and Portugal, 
economic interference from other sectors, and landlord rule in 
many parts of Latin America, developing effective central 

governments was a significant problem. 
2. Spain and Portugal had tried to address this issue during the 18
th century in the so-called 
Bourbon reforms
. C. Latin American culture began to be 
forged in the colonial period, as well.  1. Imports from Western Europe were predominant in the form of 
Catholicism and religious architectural and artistic forms.  
2. European priests and governors urged that Western standards be 
applied to families but in fact, pa
rtly because of colonial sexual exploitation of native women, large numbers of illegitimate 
children were present in Latin American families.  
III. Among the events that shaped Latin American experience in the Long 19
th Century were the wars of independence that stretched from 1810Œ1820.  
A. These independence movements reflected liberal and nationalist beliefs 
imported from Western Europe and the United States.  
 1. The goals were independence from Spanish and Portuguese 
control and the formation of liberal political states featuring 
parliaments and constitutions; there 
was also some hope of curbing 
the Catholic Church™s powers.  
B. The social base of the independence movements was fairly shallow: 
most of the leadership was Creole, 
that is, people of European origin 
born in Latin America 
C. Although a few regions saw reform, su
ch as the abolition of slavery in Mexico, the social results of these movements were generally limited.  
D. The independence movements removed the Spanish but did not 
overturn the basic ruling forces in Latin American society that revolved 

around the church, the landlord class, and, increasingly, the military. 
IV. After independence was achieved, many Latin American nations exhibited 
a characteristic set of ﬁnew nations™ﬂ problems during the 1820sŒ1840s. 
A. One of the grievances of the independence leaders was that they had 
been excluded from participation in government, but by the same 
token, not many people were available who had experience in running 

a state. B. Another characteristic problem in the formation of new nations is at 
least a brief period of economic dislocation. In Latin America, this 

problem was exacerbated by the im
portation of British industrial goods after the withdrawal of Spanish tariff and military protection. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
15C. Disputes over political legitimacy were another predictable problem. 
Although most of the independen
ce movements were hostile to 
monarchies, in certain regions, such
 as Mexico, monarchy seemed the 
most sensible system. 
1. Quarrels might also arise relating to the territorial integrity of the 
new states. Nationalist leaders in Latin America hoped to form 
large nations on the model of the United States. 
2. Most of these ambitious combina
tions fell apart, however, because the legitimacy of the territory was 
not recognized. In the process of settling boundaries, Latin America saw much political turmoil. 
D. External boundaries were often disputed in the formation of new 
nations.  
V. Certain outcomes are also character
istic of new nations™ problems.  
A. The first of these is a tendency toward political instability, which we 
see clearly in 19th- and even 20th-century Latin America.  
 1. We also note an ongoing tension between conservatives, bent on 
protecting the church and landlords, and liberals, interested in 

social reform, education, limitations on the church, and the 

creation of a parliamentary system. 
B. Another common outcome is the phenomenon of 
caudillismo
, that is, the selection of dictators whose rule promises to end instability. 
C. This aspect of Latin American hist
ory contrasts with the experience of 
the United States, also a new nation, but not one in which these 

problems occurred to the same degree.  
1. Different colonial experience had given more North Americans 
experience in government.  
2. The issue of slavery, however
, would present a significant new 
problem to the United States.  
VI. The Long 19
th Century was an important period for the development of 
Latin American culture.  
A. Latin America emerged from tentative cultural expressions to the 
potential for creating literary and artistic currents of its own.  

1. A number of Latin American novelists, for example, emerged in 
the 19
th century and exploited char
acteristic Latin American 
themes of frontiers and ethnic diversity. 
2. At the same time, these novelists and other artists were still 
strongly influenced by literary and intellectual patterns developed in Western Europe and, to some extent, in the United States.  
B. Western influences were apparent in some other respects that go 
beyond high culture. For example, in many Latin American countries, 
cities were expanded or created along European architectural lines.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
16 C. An urban middle class emerged in Latin America that often espoused 
European values, such as the new emphasis on public health measures 
or the efforts to impose Western standards on native populations. 
D. Increasing European immigrationŠto Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and, 
to some extent, BrazilŠfurthered European influence.  
E. At the same time, however, people of Native American, Mestizo, or 
African origin continued to defend popular religious traditions and other cultural elements that reflected
 a somewhat different perspective. 
VII.  Any discussion of Latin America in the Long 19
th Century must note the 
growing peripheralization of the economy.  
A. By the middle of the 19
th century, after the successful independence movements, many parts of Latin America saw the recovery of a certain 
degree of prosperity. From about 1870 onward, however, Latin 

America was marked by peripheralization.  
B. An increasing number of peoples and territories were locked into the 
production of export goods, some of which were damaging to the 

environment.  
1. More segments of the Latin American economy now depended on 
cheap labor to produce goods for the export market. 
2. Exportation, in turn, supported imports of expensive processed 
goods or produced revenues only for the upper class.  
C. A new component here was the diffi
culty faced by even reformers in 
pulling Latin America out of this peripheral relationship. 

1. Machinery for Latin American factories had to be imported from 
Western Europe or the United States and purchased with money 
borrowed from European or American banks.  
2. International indebtedness made th
e dependent status of the Latin 
American economy harder to remedy.  
3. To pay for the importation of equipment, the obvious recourse was 
to increase production of exports. 
4. To expand coffee production, it was 
necessary to press farther into the interior, which meant that railroads were needed to bring the 

product to market. To build railways, however, stock had to be 

purchased from industrial societies. 
5. This effort to increase production actually drove down prices, 
making it impossible for Latin America to pull out of economic 

dependency.  
VIII. The developments in Latin America illustrate the variety of historical 
experiences that a major society could have in the Long 19
th Century. 
A. Along with the economic dependency 
we have just discussed could 
come significant political innovation:
 not only the achievement of 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
17independence but the emergence of new political movements and the 
capacity to foster social and cultural reforms.  
B. Latin Americans themselves sometim
es debate the experiences of the Long 19th Century and earlier colonial precedence by questioning whether Latin America was a Western civilization. 
1. On the affirmative side are as
pects of the civilization™s high 
culture, in which we see a Latin American contribution to the 
common Western intellectual enterprise.  
2. On the side of complexity is the extent to which Latin American 
developments tended to be stronge
r in the humanities than science. 
3. In popular culture, Latin America was home to a number of 
vigorous popular religious movements that differed considerably 

from their European counterparts. 
4. Western liberal and nationalist id
eals appeared in Latin American 
politics, but the instability in this arena was somewhat greater in 

Latin America than in Europe. 
5. When we look at economic patterns, the picture does not look 
particularly Western at all. 
6. The question of whether Latin American civilization was Western 
can help organize our comparisons, but it entails complexities that 

reflect both earlier traditions and new aspects of the Latin 

American experience during the Long 19
th Century.

18 Lecture Twenty-Eight 
 China and JapanŠ19th-Century Pressures 
 Scope: China and Japan shared many char
acteristics, largely because of Japan™s long period of imitation. Ye
t their reactions to new Western 
pressure and the changing dynamics of the world economy were 
strikingly different, establishing two 
separate East Asian models whose 
impact is still felt today. Comparison here reveals a history important 

to East Asia but also suggests some of the wider forces operating in the 

Long 19th Century: some societies sought to emulate Japan while others 
responded in terms more similar to those of China. Japan, once forced 

to open more fully to the wider world, quickly embarked on major 

changes, while also demonstrating the possibility of modernizing 

without fully Westernizing. China long resisted pressures to reform, 

yielding only incompletely after 1900 when, to many observers, it 

already seemed too late. The causes a
nd the results of this East Asian 
differentiation are significant to the course of world history over the 

past two centuries.  Outline I. In this lecture, we will compare Japanese and Chinese developments in the 
Long 19th Century, particularly from the 1840sŒ1850s onward.  
A. A number of societies can be brought together to examine how 19
th-century factors were shaped by particular experiences.  
B. Japan and Russia constitute an interesting comparison. Both of these 
fundamentally non-Western societies launched significant industrial 

revolutions by the 1890s, although the processes of doing so differed. 
C. The Japanese-Chinese comparison is fruitful for a number of reasons.  
1. There is a marked contrast be
tween a society that introduced 
successful reforms (Japan) and a society that was unusually 

laggard (China).  
2. Nonetheless, these two societies 
shared many features. The close 
interaction of Japan and China raises the question of why one 

experience would differ so much from the other.  
3. This comparison reveals significant implications for the 20
th and even 21st centuries. II. Both Japan and China were essentially forced to address the fact of new 
Western power by developments in the middle of the 19
th century.  A. The first Opium War, beginning in
 1839, revealed the capability of Western military forces to unseat Chinese policy intentions and 

traditions. The Chinese also realized that the West
 was so eager to gain  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
19access to Chinese wealth and market
s that it would push virtually any product that would accomplish this end. 
B. Japan™s introduction to Western power took place a little later.  
 1. The arrival of Western fleets from 1853 onward was a statement 
that if Japan did not open its markets, the Western powers would 
come in force.  
 2. Military clashes occurred between Western forces and those of 
Japan. The West imposed constraints on Japanese activity that 

would ease only in the early-20th century.   3. Thus, forced entry and unwelcome intrusion are factors in both 
cases.  C. China, with its great political tr
adition, might have reacted more 
successfully to this intrusion than Japan. The Chinese also had 

technological superiority and greater 
natural resources than Japan. As 
both societies were forced into change, Japan might have been 

expected to have more difficulty.  
D. Japan did, of course, have some assets.  
 1. In the 18
th century, it had begun to open itself to foreign influence. 
2. It moved clearly toward dissemination of education. 
III. Beginning in 1868, Japan launched a series of reforms in what is called the 
Meiji era (Meiji meaning ﬁenlightenedﬂ).  
A. The Meiji era included reforms in an
 impressive variety of categories, 
beginning with politics.  
 1. In 1868, the feudal system was abolished, and the Japanese 
gradually developed a system of parliamentary monarchy with a 

constitution based on limited suffrage.  
 2. Japan also saw the emergence of a new elite that would come to 
dominate government.  
B. Early in the process, Japan began to create a European-style military 
structure with a modern navy and upgraded technology.  
C. Japanese infrastructure was mode
rnized; railroad networks were 
established that, along with shipping, unified the Japanese islands. 
D. Japanese enthusiasm for new public health measures permitted rapid 
expansion of the population.  
E. In 1872, the Japanese mandated a mass education system for both boys 
and girls.  
 1. Educational reform included modifications of the Confucian 
intellectual approach, which tended to emphasize tradition over 

creative thinking and scientific innovation.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
20  2. Schooling was provided in modern languages, including English 
and German. 
F. The Japanese enthusiasm for change extended to consumer items, such 
as toothpaste.  
 1. By 1900, department stores were established in Tokyo. 
G. These reforms did not represent a co
mplete cave-in to Westernization. 
1. In the 1880s, Japan pulled back from creating a Western 
educational system, introducing textbooks that focused on 
Japanese traditions.  
H. The reforms included a massive effort at industrialization. 
1. By the 1890s, Japan was beginning to establish a significant 
factory system with a strong emphasis on export production.  
2. Japanese industrialization was stimulated by high taxes on the 
peasantry, which helped free up funds for investment, and by poor 
working conditions.  
3. The capacity to seize much of the silk export market from the 
Chinese provided vital opportunities for foreign earnings and 
capital formation in Japan that would fuel a more general 

industrial development. 
4. By the second decade of the 20
th century, Japan would move into 
heavy industrialization, a process that would ultimately yield a 

share of world industrial leadership to the Japanese by the second 

half of the 20
th century. IV. In China, where there was no clear
 decision to embark on reform, the 
pattern was vastly different.  
A. The first railway line built in China by a private company was torn up 
by the government in a show of resistance to progress and imitation. 
B. The Chinese were modestly intere
sted in Western military innovations, 
but they did not organize the kinds of military and political changes 
that would allow them to cat
ch up to Western standards. 
C. China™s responses to modernization were further complicated by 
internal unrest and civil war in the middle of the 19
th century.  D. China™s reactions were also hamper
ed by the tendency of the Western 
powers and Russia to seize chunks of Chinese territory, where they 

then developed industry.  
 1. These intrusions reduced Chinese economic capacity and increased 
hostility to foreigners.  
 2. The Boxer Rebellion would be an understandable manifestation of 
this anti-foreign hostility. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
21E. Only in the 1890s did the Chinese begin to come to terms with the new 
situation. 
1. Chinese university students began to go to Japan and the United 
States; Christian missionary activity established new educational 
institutions in China; and traditional practices, such as foot-

binding, declined. 
2. Unfortunately, this reaction was late and incomplete.  
V. Why does the experience of China contrast so markedly with that of Japan?  
A. Western encroachments on China were much more unsettling than 
those on Japan, partly because the West
 had an older, historical thirst for Chinese access. The Japanese produced some goods the West 

wanted, but there was less pent-up demand for interference. 
B. Western intervention also caught Japan and China in different phases 
of the political cycle. 
1. The Chinese were in one of their periodic political doldrums, 
which meant that Western intrusion was less effectively opposed. 
2. The Tokugawa shogunate had some problems of social unrest and 
difficulty collecting sufficient tax revenues, but the Japanese state 
encountered the West at a point of greater strength.  
C. Although Japan and China both operate
d within a Confucian tradition, Japanese Confucianism was somewhat less traditionalist, less bent on 

absolute resistance to foreign influence, and more interested in 

spreading the benefits of education than the system in China. 
D. Japanese feudalism, which had been absent for some time from the 
Chinese tradition, may also have 
created an advantage for Japan. 1. The extent to which feudal classes remained in Japan gave that 
nation a quicker appreciation of the military aspects of the Western 
challenge than occurred in China, where the military had less 
voice.  
2. Japanese feudalism may also have created group loyalties that 
could be used for industrialization and political action. E. Japan had a history of successful imitation, and China did not. 
 1.  From their earlier interactions with China, the Japanese knew that 
it was possible to imitate wit
hout losing cultural identity or surrendering to foreigners.   2. China™s major experience of imitation, the importation of 
Buddhism, had ended badly, as had its experience with the 

Mongols. 
F. The Japanese borrowed from the West while controlling Western 
influences much more effectively than any other non-Western society 

in the Long 19
th Century.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
22  1. The Japanese regulated Western ownership during 
industrialization and modified Western influence by maintaining 
traditions of group loyalty and emperor worship. 
VI. By the end of the Long 19
th Century, the differences between Japan and 
China had significant consequences. 
A. In the 1890s, Japan and China went to
 war, and the Japanese, with their 
modern military and industrial st
rength, won fairly handily.  1. One result of the conflict was a pattern of ongoing Japanese 
influence in Korea.  B. Japan would soon also confront Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 
1904Œ1905. Again the Japanese won. Russia, although industrializing, 
remained a more cumbersome society and had more trouble bringing 
military force to bear in the Pacific than did the Japanese. 
C. Power balances shifted as the Japanese began to make their own claim 
to global power. Comparative differences between Japan and China 
were translated into ongoing military hostilities, extending into renewed Japanese attacks on China 
in the 1930s and into World War II 
and beyond.  
D. A somewhat less concrete result of
 the different paths of Japan and 
China in the Long 19
th Century involves social stability. 1. Japan™s reform experience, including its industrialization, created 

massive social tension.  
2. In China, many leaders believed that the only way to mount a 

successful response to Western intrusion was through outright 

revolution.  
VII.  The Japanese experience at the end of the Long 19
th Century was unique.  
A. Japan experienced modernization without full Westernization and 
would become an important addition to the roster of industrial and 

military powers of the modern world.  
B. The Chinese sluggishness in responding to outside challenge was 
greater than that of many other societies but, in many ways, more 

typical. Many societies had difficulty addressing the implications of 

Western power for effective political
 and economic operation at home.  
C. The Chinese deficit here, however
, was not permanent. When we 
introduce the final period in world history in the next lecture, we will 

see not only the significance of Japan™s ongoing role but the growing 

muscle of China in world affairs, as well.

24 Lecture Twenty-Nine 
 The 20th21st Centuries as a New Period 
 Scope: The 20th century meets the two basic definitions of a new period: 
themes dominant in the previous period are no longer dominant, and 
major new themes surface. The 20
th century divides into three sub-
periods: the decades dominated by 
world wars and depression; the postwar years, highlighted by decolonization and the Cold War; and 

the now almost two postŒCold War decades. Beginning with World 

War I, the military and political dominance of the West began to 

erodeŠtwo of the themes that had most clearly shaped the Long 19
th Century. The world wars greatly weakened the West, accelerating 
international demands for independence. Even the West™s economic 

dominance, though more clearly sustained, began to be qualified by 

new competitors, particularly from the Pacific Rim. As old themes 

faded, new ones surfaced. Politically, almost every regime operating in 
1900 was replaced at least once; the decline of monarchy and empire 
was striking. Simultaneously, the landholding aristocracy was 

displaced as the preeminent social 
class. New types of warfare and space travel might also be advanced
 as defining themes, though to date, 
some caution might be warranted here. The two leading new themes, to 

which every major society had to
 react, were unprecedented global population growth and the new technological and organizational 

capacity for global contacts. Popula
tion explosion and its attendant 
migration had obvious political and e
nvironmental effects, helping to 
unseat older regimes. A steady stream of connective technologies 

supported the emergence of new organizational forms, such as the 

multinational corporation. These th
emes supplanted the preeminence of 
the West in shaping the new world history era. 
 Outline I. The contemporary period presents ch
allenges to world history teaching. A. As we look at developments over the past century, we must be careful 
to maintain contact with earlier patterns, with characteristics of the 

individual major civilizations, and with earlier processes in world 

history. In studying change in the contemporary period, we risk 

ignoring the fact that this period does not stand in isolation to the past.  
B. Although the contemporary period is new, some features, such as the 
cultural, political, economic, and military power of the West, are 

carryovers from the Long 19
th Century and even earlier. The world economy also persisted in some ways, and modernization blossomed 

further in this period.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
25C. Two key issues in dealing with the contemporary period involve the 
currency and complexity of developments over the past century and the 
fact that we do not know the end of the story. We can point to changes 

from patterns in the Long 19
th Century, but we cannot always say that 
new patterns are well establishe
d, and we cannot make final 
determinations about new directions. 
D. The 20
th and early-21st centuries are usually divided into three phases. 
1. The years 1914Œ1945 were dominated by two world wars, the 
Depression, disarray in Western society, stirrings in other 

societies, and the force of new revolutions, particularly in the 

Soviet Union. 
2. The years 1945Œ1990 were marked by the Cold War, which 
provides an alternative to the main frame of reference that applied 

to the world war and interwar period.  
3. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold 
War, we enter the third phase of
 the contemporary era, marked, 
perhaps, by the emergence of th
e United States as ﬁthe world™s only superpower,ﬂ along with some questions about how long that 
role would last. 
E. The two world wars posed new questions about the Western role in the 
world, particularly the West European role.  
1. We see a decline of Western Europe in world affairs, particularly 
after World War II; this decline opened a transitional framework in 
which the Soviet Union and the United States disputed world 

dominance.  
2. That transitional system failed,
 and the Cold War became a first 
statement about how to address the shifting world power balance.  
3. In the third phase of the contemporary era, we are involved in 
more open-ended questions about what the new power structure 

will be. 
F. It is important to remember that the contemporary period is still a 
recent one in world history; some of 
the details have yet to be worked out, and some of the new themes have yet to be fully established.  
II. What are the new themes in the contemporary period? 
A. The dominant social class in mo
st societies in 1900 or 1914 was still the landed aristocracy. By the early-21st century, the aristocracy is almost gone, replaced by a new kind of professional middle class.  
 1. This social class thinks of the world more in industrial than in 
agricultural terms, more in urban terms than in rural, and more in 

managerial structures than in terms of private land ownership.  
B. In 1900 or 1910, the world™s 
major political regimes were 
predominantly monarchies or empire
s, but these systems are largely 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
26 gone in the early-21
st century. The alternatives include democracies, 
along with authoritarian regimes and communist systems.   
C. Gender relationships also seem to enter a new phase in the 
contemporary era. Older systems of patriarchy were modified by 
efforts to give women the vote, improve their educational levels, and 

provide them with some legal rights. 
1. The gender system that would 
replace the patriarchal system, 
however, has not been clearly defined. The new system is not 
completely egalitarian and does not fully address women™s 

economic role or the issue of male violence against women. 
2. The contemporary period is partly defined by shifts in gender 
relations, but the themes here have not been fully established. 
D. The contemporary period offers a new set of challenges to older 
cultural beliefs; these challenges 
come from communism, a greater 
mass appeal of nationalism, consumerism, and science. 
1. In important ways these cultural options do not entirely agree with 
one another. 
2. By the early-21
st century, these options had not fully succeeded in 
displacing the old.  
3. The cultural map of the contem
porary period is complicated; we 
cannot say for sure that the older patterns have been vanquished. 
III. In defining the contemporary period, we must look at the shift away from 
dominant patterns of the Long 19
th Century and, to some extent, aspects of 
the early modern period. We begin by looking at the relative decline of the 
West, for which we see evidence beginning in World War I. 
A. Both world wars, apart from their global dimensions, can be seen as a 
giant internal civil war within the West. In this conflict, the West™s 
inability to maintain its power position in the world accelerated as a 

result of the economic, political, 
and population damage Western 
societies inflicted on one another. 
B. The measurements of relative decline important here are found in the 
military and in the West™s capacity to control most other parts of the 
world.  C. In the early-21
st century, the West still possessed the greatest military 
power in the world as a whole. But the capacity of the West to move 
almost at will militarily had been cu
rtailed by the second half of the 20th century.  1. One reason for this was that Western countries became less willing 
to invest heavily in maintaining cutting-edge military technologies.  
2. Several other parts of the world began to emphasize military 
tactics that could stalemate the West™s advantage in conventional 

armamentŠsuch as guerilla warfare in Vietnam or the resistance 

in urban settings seen in Algeria and Iraq. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
273. As individual countries gained independence and a measure of 
economic success, they invested in
 military force. The West could 
still defeat such countries, but doing so took much
 more planning 
and economic commitment than previously.  
D. We also see decline in the West™s cap
acity to control most of the rest of 
the world directly through colonies and colonial administrations.  
1. One key development in the contemporary period, starting 
between the wars and accelerating after World War II, was 
decolonization.  
2. Western political and economic
 influence could survive decolonization in some cases, but the world as a whole saw a much 
reduced capacity of any single civilization or society to dominate 
global politics.  
E. Some people argue that the relative decline of the West will ultimately 
yield predominance to another civilization but there is no inherent 

reason that a pattern of successive dominance must repeat itself.  
IV. Several other themes began to gain ascendancy in the contemporary period.  
A. In future centuries, people may see the fundamental innovation of the 
contemporary period as the beginning of humankind™s conquest of 

outer space.   1. In the early-21
st century, however, space exploration has not yet had a deep impact on human life or the patterns of global societies. 
B. Another candidate for the contemporary period™s fundamental 
innovation is the altered nature of war and military technology in the 
21st century.  1. The two world wars introduced the concept of 
total war
Šthe mobilization of all the major resources of the key combatants, not 

just armies and navies but th
e economy and civilians, as well. 
2. World War II gave birth to the capability to end human existence 
with nuclear weapons.  
3. Among the new themes of the contemporary era  were the 
tightened organizational capacity in
 war, societies™ insistence on total surrender as a result of their investment, and the threat of 

devastating and fearsome new technology.  
C. Another theme of the contemporary period is massive global 
population increase. This population growth carries over into other 

features that begin to reshape the world. 1. World population explosion encourages new patterns of 
immigration, bringing together people from different cultural 
backgrounds and leading to new challenges in many societies.  
2. Population explosi
on also places unprecedented stress on global environments. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
28 D. The final defining theme invol
ves the steady acceleration of communication and transportation technologies. 
1. Important developments here include radio, satellite 
communications, the Internet, and air travel.  
2. These technologies offer unpreceden
ted opportunities and, in some 
ways, pose unprecedented threats and challenges to the identities of individual societies.  
3. The accelerated movement 
of ideas, goods, and peoples, sometimes referred to as 
globalization
, is an indisputable mark of 
the new period of world history.  
E. In the next lecture, we will turn
 to changes in the world economy, 
where we will find echoes of the themes we have discussed here and, 
again, significant change but no certainty about the outcomes.

decline of the West a valid historical
 theme for the contemporary period of 
world history?

29Lecture Thirty 
 The World EconomyŠChange and Continuity 
 Scope: One of the frameworks for world history from the early modern period 
onward has been the unequal relationships in world trade. The 

dominance of the industrial West in the Long 19
th Century was a 
crucial factor for literally every society in the world. In the 

contemporary period, elements of the now-traditional world economy 

persisted. The basic definition of the core economies survived, though 

now with primary emphasis on high-tech, service, and entertainment 

products. Peripheral or dependent economies dotted the landscape; the 

increasing peripheralization of much of Africa was a key development 

during the 20
th century. The addition of Japan and the Pacific Rim to 
the list of core economies was another crucial development. Another 

change was intriguing though shorter-lived: at various points in the 

mid-20
th century, a variety of societies sought to escape the world 
economy, setting up separate economic 
zones. This was an interesting comment on the downside of the world economy previously, but also 

on some increase in the latitude
 available to escape Western 
domination. The most important general shift, marking a new stage in 

the evolution of the world economy, was the capacity of many societies 

to gain some relief from the wors
t inferiorities of the world economy 
and to introduce new sources of profit. This process began in the 1920s 

but reached fuller fruition toward the end of the century. From Brazil to 
China, a number of countries once included in an undifferentiated 
Third World status managed, wit
hout achieving full equality with the core, to become major international 
players. Forecasts suggested that this trend would continue into the global future. 
 Outline I. The world economy reveals both continuity and change in world history 
between the Long 19
th Century and the contemporary era.  
A. One might think that the economy is an area where continuity 
predominates; core economies and peri
pheries, for example, still exist.  
B. The term 
Third World, in some ways, seems to enshrine continuity. 
Over time, this term came to refer to parts of the world that were not 
industrialized and were vastly poorer than the First World.  
C. The world economy concept itself, as enunciated by Wallerstein, was 
meant to enshrine persistence. Wallerstein™s point was that the origins 

of the fatal economic gaps that persisted in the contemporary world 

could be found in the early modern period and the 19
th century.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
30 D. Core characteristics can still be identified in the 21
st century in much of 
Western Europe and the United States.  
 1. These societies still export expensive goods and import cheaper 
goods, using trading companies based in the core.  
 2. They rely on wage labor and have, for the most part, stable 
governments.  
 3. Their goods, however, have changed; they now export 
professional services and many entertainment staples. 
E. A few societies did not display core characteristics in terms of export-
import but managed to maintain fairly high standards of living. These 
societies fit a semi-core definition.  
 1. Canada, for example, was a leading raw materials and food 
supplier to the United States.  
 2. Australia, by the later-20
th century, was the leading raw materials 
supplier to Japan.  
F. Peripheries were still characteri
zed by relatively weak governments 
and continued to export cheap goods, such as lower-level manufactured 

products. Some of the locations of the periphery shifted. 
1. Peripheral societies still existed in Latin America and Central 
America, where cheap factory products and drugs were exported. 
2. The key periphery during the contemporary period, however, 
could be found in sub-Saharan Africa, where food supplies, raw 
materials, and mining supplies were the predominant exports.  
3. Although Africa had been colonized by the end of the Long 19
th Century, it was only in the 20
th century that its economy was 
converted more fully to peripheral status by the operations of 

colonial powers.  
G. The most striking shift in the contemporary period was the entry into 
the core of Japan, followed by other parts of the Pacific Rim, including 

South Korea and Taiwan. 
1. This development modified the association of the core with the 
West; thus, when we think about the relative decline of the West, 
we must consider the fact that Western Europe™s monopoly over 

core status was qualified by the addition of parts of East Asia. 
2. A second cultural zone was now capable of advanced 
industrialization and participation in the core. Japan, South Korea, 

and Taiwan imitated Western countries in many respects, but they 

maintained a Confucian emphasis on group loyalty, group values, 

collective decision-making, and close relationships between the 

state and the private sector. H. Earlier patterns seem to be persistent in the contemporary period. Some 
societies still reap disproportionate benefits from world trade, while 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
31some labor under disadvantages. The only things that seem to have 
changed are the geography, some of the entrants in both camps, and the 

specific goods exchanged.  
II. This emphasis on persistence, however, misses the clear beginnings of 
efforts to move away from the world economic framework in several ways.  
A. Beginning early in the 20
th century, a number of societies saw that the 
world economy was not working to 
their benefit; they needed to establish their own market framewo
rks that would release them from 
dependence on global economic relationships.  
B. The first country that came to this realization was Russia, where the 
doctrine of socialism under Stalin proclaimed that the Soviet Union 
could industrialize without significant contact with the rest of the 

world. Soviet economic growth, however, came at the cost of low 

wages, social frustration, and environmental damage.  
C. In the 1960s, China attempted a similar isolation. After the Communist 
Revolution was completed in 1949, China™s industrialization was 

meant to proceed in conjunction w
ith the Soviet Union™s. Later, however, China moved toward an even more isolationist policy. 
D. As World War II neared, Japanese attempts to establish relationships 
with a colonial sphere in East and Southeast Asia represented another 
effort at partial economic isolation. Japan envisioned what it called the 

co-prosperity sphere, in which a set of countries would trade with 
Japan in unequal relationships. 
E. Nazi Germany, to some extent, also sought to separate itself from the 
world economy. The goal was for Germany to set up a colonial 

relationship with the agricultural regions of Eastern Europe and, again, 

launch a mini-world economy in which German industrial might was 

supported by cheap exports from the Slavic hinterland. 
F. This interlude is echoed even in the 21
st century by small cases of 
economic isolation, most notably in North Korea. 
G. By the later-20
th century, most of the societies that had tried the go-it-
alone policy had concluded that it was a mistake and, one by one, 

rejoined the world economy.  
III. The more durable efforts to adjust to the world economy in ways that 
complicate the core-periphery relationships fall into several categories. 
A. Peripheral societies are characterized by low-wage economies, a small 
capitalist class, and intense pressure for more sophisticated exports. 
Elements of peripheralization, in the sense of low-wage export sectors, 

still exist in the economies we will discuss.  
B. The first method used to help countries climb out of peripheralization 
was the policy of 
import substitution
, initiated in the 1920s.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
32 1. Under this policy, the government, working with private 
entrepreneurs, sets up production of some essential but less 
sophisticated industrial products, such as textiles, automobiles, and 

basic appliances; these products, then, no longer have to be 

imported from the core.  
2. This move does not totally break the core-periphery relationship, 
but it reduces the importation of expensive items; import 

substitution is also usually accomp
anied by protective tariffs.  3. Many economists question the long-term utility of these measures, 
but in the short run they can help moderate dependency. 
4. Latin American countries, suffering from the Great Depression, 
moved toward import substitution in the mid- to late 1930s; India 

would adopt measures of import substitution after it achieved 

independence in 1947. 
5. The goods produced for import substitution were not necessarily 
of as high quality as those produced by the core, but these products 

satisfied part of local demand and reduced economic pressure. 
C. Another method used to escape peripheralization was to seize on one 
particular good that was either valuable or could be produced in newly 

efficient ways and translated into exports; the most obvious case in 

point here is Middle Eastern oil, initially a peripheral product. 1. When Western companies controlled the supply, oil was 
essentially a cheap product.  
2. Once independence was achieved by major Middle Eastern and 
North African nations after World War II, however, political 

measures could be used to seize control of the oil and make it a 

very profitable export. 
3. This is what happened in the Gulf
 states in the decades since the 1950s.  4. Other products could be used, as
 well; Chile, for example, by the 
1970s and 1980s, was breaking out of the peripheral trap by 

emphasizing vegetable and fruit production for U.S. markets.  
D. The third method to break out of peripheralization was to develop a 
few sectors in which an economy could begin to compete with the 

coreŠby exporting processed goods on a worldwide basis.  
1. Brazil, for example, negotiated with the United States during 
World War II for the provision of a modern steel industry in return 
for American use of Brazilian observation posts. 
2. The Brazilians also became aware 
of the military implications of 
the computer industry fairly early, and the government began to 

sponsor investments in computers.  
3. The Brazilian economy continues to
 have pockets of poverty and many peripheral industries and agricultural sectors, but it has 

moved out of an easily definable category.

334. By the 1990s and the early years of the 21
st century, the big stories 
in export sectors were, of course, China and India. 
5. China became, almost literally, th
e workshop of the world. Wages 
were low and workers were exploited, but the capacity to produce 
textiles, electronics, gifts, and other basic goods makes it 
impossible now to define China as a peripheral economy. 
6. India™s transformation involved less emphasis on global 
manufacturing and more on the development of service industries. 
E. A host of societies, by using one or more of these innovative methods, 
have thus complicated their categorization in the world economy.  
IV. The contemporary period continues elements inherited from the Long 19
th Century, but it puts its own stamp on these patterns. 
A. By the later-20
th and early-21st centuries, we see what some economists 
are calling the industrialization of the world. In the late-20
th century, about 20 percent of the world™s population was actively involved in 
industrializing economies; this number has jumped to 60 percent in the 

early-21st century. B. The inequality of economic relations
hips among different parts of the 
world is not gone, but by the 21
st century the key issues were not so much among regions as within them, generated by the process of 

partial industrialization and import substitution.

34 Lecture Thirty-One 
 An Age of Revolutions  Scope: The 20th century saw an unprecedented number of political and social revolutions. These were a key part of the larger process of political and 
social change. Major revolutions
 included the Russian, Chinese, Mexican, and Iranian revolutions, but there were also revolutions 

during the 1950s and 1970s in Bolivia, Egypt, Vietnam, Cuba, 

Nicaragua, and elsewhere. Industrialized and newly decolonized 

nations were largely exempt, but otherwise, the process, though hardly 

universal, was widespread. Revolutions resulted from peasant 

discontent, inept political repression, new ideologies, and resentment of 

Western influence or control. Liberal strands were less prominent than 

in the Atlantic revolutions around the turn of the 19
th century.  Revolutions generated authoritarian regimes for a considerable time, 

efforts at cultural change, curtailment of the traditional upper class, and 

some limitations on Western influence, though the range of 

consequences varied considerably
. Revolutions also pushed more 
established regimes, particularly the United States, toward greater 

conservatism. Revolutions did not define the whole of 20
th-century world history, but they contributed to major changes even outside the 

societies directly affected. At the end of the 20th century, a somewhat 
more peaceful spread of democracy raised questions about the future 

need for revolutionary outbreaks. 
 Outline I. This lecture focuses on the revolutions
 that began in the second decade of the 20
th century and continued until the 1980s. We will look at the basic 
dynamics of these revolutions and how they helped launch fundamental 

changes in the contemporary period. 
A. A revolution is a violent attempt to change the political system, 
introduce new social layers into the 
system, and effect social change. A 
revolution differs from a coup d™état, which can be significant in an 
individual society but does not bring about fundamental changes.  
B. In the 20
th century, we must differentiate between revolutions and wars 
of independence. Significant independence struggles took place in the 20th century, but they were not revolutions in the sense of using 
violence to undertake a thorough political and social cleansing. C. The 20
th-century revolutions involved many parts of the world, 
including parts of Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle 

East. This geographical spread represents the extent to which activities 

that previously were regional now became global. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
35II. The 20
th century saw four major revolutions. 
A. The first revolution was the Mexican revolution in 1910Œ1920, 
reflecting a variety of grievances and involving a variety of groups. 
1. Middle-class liberals involved in the Mexican revolution sought 
political and constitutional reforms; peasant revolutionaries, such 
as Pancho Villa, were interested in land reforms.  
2. The goals of the Mexican revolution were varied, and it took a 
decade of recurrent revolutionary activity for a settlement to be 
reached.  3. The revolution ultimately resulted in limited land reforms, the 
installation of a one-party political system that provided political 

coherence, and genuine but noncompetitive elections. 
4. The Mexican revolution was unusual in having limited direct 
influence elsewhere. B. The second revolution was the Chinese Revolution. 
1. Beginning in 1911, a group of middle-class revolutionary students 
and intellectuals overthrew the imperial system.  
2. Initial efforts to establish a Western-style parliamentary 
democracy were hampered by 
the power claims of regional 
warlords and landlords, by the i
nvasion of the Japanese, and by 
divisions among Chinese revolutionaries.  
3. The new communist movement that was born in the early 1920s 
would ultimately preva
il in China in 1949. C. The third great revolution was the Soviet revolution in 1917.  
1. The Communist Revolution was insp
ired by Russia™s hardships in World War I, longstanding peasant and worker grievances, and 

widespread concern about the police and authoritarian measures of 

the tsarist regime. 
2. In 1917, the Bolsheviks took over and launched a period of 
significant political, social, and cultural upheaval.  D. The fourth revolution, the Iranian revolution of 1979, was hailed at the 
time as possibly the first great Third World revolution. 
1. It was not dependent on Western ideas of any sort but was an 
Islamic revolution against undue Western influence and against an 
authoritarian and corrupt political regime  
2. It urged a return to more funda
mental Islamic political principles. 
3. It was meant to inspire a wave of similar revolutions in other 
societies. E. In addition to these major revolutions, the 20
th century, particularly 
after World War II, was peppered by other revolutionary surges in 

smaller areas. 
1. The 1950s, for example, saw revolution in Egypt, Bolivia, and 
Cuba. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
36 2. The 1970s saw revolution in Nicaragua. 
3. Vietnam constituted a revolution as well as a war for 
independence. 
F. Major upheavals take some time to work out in terms of attainment of 
revolutionary goals and adjustment of the society. This process may 
still be occurring in some of the 20
th-century cases. G. Revolutions never change everything; they always preserve significant 
segments of the ﬁold regimeﬂ; th
e Russian Revolution, for example, 
replicated some of the tsarist interests.  
III. The core components of 20
th-century revolutions add up to four basic 
points. 
A. The first component is a weak regime; revolutions do not occur against 
vigorous regimes, even if they are corrupt and unjust in other respects.  
B. Second, every revolution needs at least one large group with elements 
who believe that violence is justified to achieve legitimate social ends; 
in 20
th-century revolutions, the most consistent provider of this muscle 
was the peasantry plus, in some cases, the working class in cities.  
C. A third component of 20
th-century revolution involves what might be 
called an ideological buildup
; before the revolution, crucial ideologies 
are disseminated that help inspire revolutionary leaders.  
1. In Mexico, early China, a
nd very early Russia, some 
revolutionaries were inspired by liberal and democratic principles. 
2. In Iran, the dominant ideology 
was a restatement of what some 
leaders believed to be the fundamentals of Islam.  
3. The dominant revolutionary ideology of the 20
th centuryŠoperative in Russia, China, Vietnam, Cuba, and elsewhereŠwas 
Marxism, which called for an overthrow of the existing system by 
the working class.  D. The fourth component in the 20
th-century revolutions was some degree 
of concern about undue Western ownership and influence; we see this 

concern in Iran, Mexico, and Russia. 
IV. What did the 20
th-century revolutions accomplish?  
A. 20th-century revolutions, although they might have intended otherwise, 
uniformly produced authoritarian regimes.  
1. Major revolutions inevitably result in internal backlash: aristocrats, 
conservatives, and sometimes religious leaders begin to organize 
military movements against the revolution, and this action in turn 

induces the revolutionaries to impose authority.  
2. In many revolutions, significant foreign resistance is evident, 
which again inspires revolutiona
ry leaders to lean toward authoritarian control to defend the revolution against its enemies.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
373. These impulses toward author
itarianism occurred quicker and 
more fully in the 20
th-century cases than had been true in the 
Atlantic revolutionary period. 
B. Another major consequence of the 20
th-century revolutions was social 
change.   1. The communist revolutions in Russia and China, for example, 
eliminated the landlord class, sometimes with brutality and 
sometimes with ﬁreeducationﬂ or political discipline. 
C. Revolutions in the 20
th century uniformly attempted cultural 
reconditioning to reorient cultural signals inherited from the past.  
1. One of the triumphs of the Mexican revolution, for example, was 
the emergence of a new popular culture embellished by artistic and 
architectural efforts to pay homag
e to the Indian heritage of 
Mexico and to the importance 
of workers and peasants.  2. The communist revolutions would spend much time emphasizing 
cultural reeducation and new artistic principles under the banner of 

socialist realism. 
D. Finally, all the revolutions, though to different degrees, reduced 
Western influence, at least for 
a time, and offered opportunities for 
political power to new groups of people.   1. Those from worker or peasant b
ackgrounds did not necessarily run the show, but there was significant political mobility and, with 

this, a surge of new blood, new interest, and new abilities to 
connect the revolutionary regime with ordinary people. 
V. Revolutions occurred in some places, not all.  
A. Revolutions have not yet occurred, for the most part, in countries that 
experienced an independence struggle during the 20
th century or in 
successfully industrialized societies.  
B. Nevertheless, revolutions have influence beyond their borders.  
 1. Marxist movements, for exampl
e, compel significant attention 
even in societies where revolutions have not broken out, as we see 

in India and Africa.  
 2. Revolutions help engender other 
types of protest movements and 
may also push regimes, as a means of avoiding revolution, into 

political and social change that might not otherwise be undertaken. 
C. Twentieth-century revolutions helped create a new conservative block 
among world powers, ultimately h
eaded by the United States.  1. The Unites States undoubtedly entered the 20
th century with a 
sense of its own revolutionary heritage and a certain sympathy for 

revolutionary strivings. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
38 2. From the Mexican and the Russian revolutions onward, however, 
Americans became concerned about
 the impact of revolution on 
American property rights and values and the potential for the 
importation of revolutionary movements into the United States. 
VI. Is the age of 20
th-century revolution now over?  
A. Despite significant movements, such as the anti-apartheid struggle or 
the collapse of communism, we have seen no major revolutionary 

outbreaks for at least 20 years.   1. The influence of Marxism as an inspirational ideology has 
diminished and will probably not be revived.  
 2. As the world becomes more ur
ban, the peasantry has almost 
disappeared.  B. These changes might suggest that the current era of revolution is over, 
although revolution may well recur at some later stage.  
C. In examining contemporary world history, what™s important to 
remember is that, even if the age of revolution has passed, revolutions 

provided a significant spur to change in a number of countries and a 

number of regions beyond the revolutions themselves.

why was this trend stronger in the 20
th century than before?

39Lecture Thirty-Two 
 The United States in World History 
 Scope: At various points, pundits hailed the 20
th century as the ﬁAmerican 
century,ﬂ and although this is a bit of an exaggeration, it is clear that 
the U.S. role in the world increased fairly steadily. This constitutes a 

major feature in the contemporary period of world history to date. The 

development also raises some intriguing analytical questions about how 

to ﬁinsertﬂ the United States given that American history is usually 

taught separately from world history and many world historians feel 

they already have enough to do without adding another country. This 

lecture explores the issues involved, with principal focus on the U.S. 

world role as it evolved in contemporary world history. The first issue 

involves chronology: when does inclusion of the United States become 

inescapable in a world history course? The second issue involves status 
as a civilization: should the United States be treated as a civilization all its own (or maybe as a major part of a 
settler society
 category that would include Canada and Australia), or is it part of Western 
civilization? Americans themselves oscillate on this issue. Finally, as 

the United States becomes more important in world affairs, what if any 

distinctive contributions does it make compared to its West European 

progenitors? Is the world really different for having the United States 

rather than Western Europe as a 
leading power? This lecture raises 
issues rather than offering definitive solutions; an understanding of the terms of debate is particularly important here. 
 Outline I. The task in this lecture is to place 
the United States in world history, and the main way to achieve this goal is to discuss certain issues that do not 

always have clear resolutions but need to be addressed to make this 

connection.  
A. When world history began as a t
eaching subject, it tended not to cover the United States in detail because American history was covered in 
other courses. At the same time, American history did not extensively 
address the subject of the United States as a world actor. B. Over the past 10Œ15 years, world historians have realized that the 
United States is too important a player in world historical activities to 

leave out of the picture. C. In this lecture, we will see how we can fit the United States in with 
other societies, particularly in the contemporary period. 
D. Another issue we must confront is that most U.S. history is taught with 
an exceptionalist approach.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
40 1. In this approach, the experience 
of being in America is said to 
have created a separate set of trajectories and an exception to European patterns, despite signifi
cant earlier European influences in America.  
2. This exceptionalism is a legitimate stance if it is approached 
analytically; too often, however, it is merely asserted. 
II. The first issue we™ll examine is chronological: at what point in time does 
the involvement of the United States on the world stage become so 
significant that the country must be included in the study of world history?  
A. In the colonial period, the United St
ates was a slave recipient, but slave imports to what became the United 
States constituted less than 1/10th of the total traffic across the Atlantic.  
1. The colonies contributed to the world economy, especially the 
South, and the United States received a certain amount of 
immigration from other parts of the world, particularly Europe. 
2. Thus, a colonial connection exists, but most of the developments 
can be subsumed into other concepts, such as the world economy.  
B. The American Revolution warrants mo
re attention because it helps to illustrate the range and trajectories of the Atlantic revolutions.  

1. The American Revolution undoubtedly inspired revolutionary 
activities in Western Europe, particularly in France, and provided 
inspiration to the Latin American wars of independence.  
2. This moment in U.S. history must be addressed in world history, 
along with a number of other examples. 
C. During the early-19
th century, the United States was preoccupied with domestic developments and westwa
rd expansion, which brought the 
nation into further contact with Canada and Mexico.  
1. The United States was also preo
ccupied with defining American 
institutions and characteristics and addressing the slave issue.  
2. These developments are important, but they do not necessarily 
require extensive treatment from a world history standpoint. 
D. By the time we reach the 1860s or 
the postŒCivil War period, we must 
treat the United States as a significant part of world history. 
1. By this point, the U.S. ec
onomy, although still dependent on 
European capital and technological inspiration, had grown 
sufficiently to influence world trade patterns.  
2. The United States also became i
nvolved in global arms trade, a 
theme that remains consistent in world history to the present day. 
3. The United States was a somewh
at conflicted imperial power, 
taking important colonies in the 
1890s but also criticizing colonial activity.  
4. In the early-20
th century, the United States became involved in the 
course of European diplomacy, playing intermediary between 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
41European combatants and, with Wo
rld War I, directly entering the 
diplomatic-military mainstream. 
5. We see a brief pullback with isolationism, but from the final third 
of the 19
th century to the present, the United States is a prime actor 
in world affairs. III. What analytical framework do we us
e to place the United States in the world history context? 
A. In these lectures, we have frequen
tly used the civilizational approach, 
looking at particular societies to make sense of comparative 
developments and larger world forces
. Is the United States a separate civilization or not? If not, the usual alternative would be to treat the 

United States as part of an expanded Western civilization zone.  
B. A legitimate case can be made for treating the United States as a 
separate civilization. This is the thrust of the American exceptionalist 

argument, but there is an
 alternative argument.  
C. The United States can be fit into a smaller number of 
settler societies
 that emerged in the 18
th and 19th centuries. 1. Settler societies are those in wh
ich the majority of the population 
is European but which also encompass native peoples and other 

strands of immigration; settler societies are also frontier societies. 
2. The United States might be viewed
 as the most important case of a 
larger nexus of settler societies that includes Canada, Australia, 

and New Zealand. 
D. Returning to the question of whether the United States constitutes its 
own civilization, what durable and 
distinctive characteristics can we find to make that case? 
1. In contrast to Western civilization until the 20
th century, the United 
States never had a true aristocracy or a peasantry; the free farming 
tradition of the United States differs markedly in terms of 
economic behavior and political impulses. 
2. The United States had an experi
ence of internal slavery and, following slavery, racial issues that did not affect Western 
civilization to the same degree. 
3. The United States has frequently 
experienced levels of crime, 
particularly violent crime, much different from those of Western 

Europe. 4. In contrast to Western Europe, the United States managed to 
industrialize and modernize while remaining on the whole an 
intensely religious society. 
5. The United States has been much more hostile to socialism than 
Western Europe and has never developed a significant welfare 
state by European standards.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
42 6. The idea of the United States as a nation of more inventive people 
compared to Europeans or ot
hers has largely faded away. 
7. The notion that the United States offers more social mobility than 
other parts of the world is not borne out by the data, although it is 
interesting that Americans believe their society to be more open.  
E. We can legitimately point to some distinctive American features, but 
we need to balance this with the recognition that the United States 

continues to share much w
ith a larger Western zone. 
1. For example, American industrialization in the early-19
th century proceeded almost as part of the 
same process of industrialization 
that affected France, Belgium,
 Germany, and elsewhere.  
2. In the same period, the United States began to reduce its birth rate; 
this occurred at the same basic time and for the same basic reasons 

as in many West European countries. 
3. The reentry of married women into the labor force of the 1950s 
and 1960s was essentially the same phenomenon for the United 

States and Western Europe; the sexual revolution that began 

around 1960 also had the same pattern in both places. 
F. As we try to place the United States
 in a world history context, we must recognize these issues relating 
to categorization and civilizational framework. 
G. We should also note that relationships between the United States and 
Western Europe have not remain
ed constant. In the decades immediately after World War II, the 
United States and Western Europe 
seem to converge, but recent decades
 have seen increased separation. IV. As the United States becomes more important in world affairs, does it exert 
a special mark on the rest of the wo
rld or does it follow a dynamic already 
established by larger Western interactions? 
A. Without question, the United States exercises increasing power and has 
increasing influence on world events in the contemporary period. But 
in doing so, has the nation become more significant?  
 1. Europeans frequently argue that 
as the United States became more 
important in world affairs the nation displayed a combination of 

inexperience and moralistic naiveté 
that contrasted with the more 
sober, realistic approach that Europeans took. 
 2. Some critics have argued that the United States displays an 
unusual pension for high-tech approaches to military activities, 
particularly in World War II and the years afterward. 
 3. Analysts have argued that the United States became more 
interested than Western Europe in promoting the destruction of 

colonialism and encouraging democracy. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
43 4. A case can be made for American influence in shaping world 
consumerism: the United States was not the origin of modern 
consumerist society, but it embraced consumerism and played a 

significant popular cultural role in world affairs. 
B. We must note that as the United 
States became more potent in world 
affairs, it assumed the neo-imperialist mantle that Western Europe had 

developed: it tried to pick up pieces of empire, for example, from the 
French and Vietnam or pieces of Br
itish policy in the Middle East and Greece after World War II.  
C. The same idea applies to its core activities: in its interest to obtain 
access to cheap goods and protect export opportunities for high-tech operations and basic food stuffs, the United States behaves much as 

core societies have since the advent of the world economy.  
D. The debate about the place of the Un
ited States in world history is a difficult and revealing one, in which historical traditions play against 

contemporary operations and the United States can be seen as both a 

separate civilization and part of a larger Western thrust.

44 Lecture Thirty-Three 
 Contemporary Democracy 
 Scope: In 1900, most of the world™s 
political systems revolved around 
monarchy, empire, and colony. These highly traditional political forms 
would steadily erode in the 20
th century, as monarchy proved 
unsatisfactory (save perhaps at the figurehead level) in all but a few 
regions, colonies fell victim to nationalism, and multinational empires 

proved difficult to sustain. In place of these forms, three main political 
configurations emerged. Totalitarian systems, whether communist or 

fascist, were one option; authoritarian regimesŠless systematic in their 

use of power than the totalitarians, though equally intolerant of political competitionŠwere another; and democracies were a third.  
  As the contemporary period of world history opened, democracy 
seemed to be spreading from its base in Western Europe, the United 
States, and Australia. But its spread in Central and East-Central Europe 
and in southern Europe proved short-lived, Mexico moved to a one-
party model, and Japan™s strides to
ward democracy were undercut by 

military authoritarians. As is we
ll known, the 1930s were not kind to the democratic system of government; some advance occurred as a 

result of World War II in the defeated Axis powers but most strikingly 

in India; on the other hand, most new nations, though often launched as 

democracies, quickly retreated to
ward authoritarianism. A wider 
pattern opened in the 1970s, with changes in southern Europe and, 

particularly, Latin America. Democr
acy reached new parts of Asia in the 1980s, and of course, changes in the Soviet Empire created still 
further opportunities. Democracies spr
ead more widely in Africa in the 
1990s and reached a discussion stage in the Middle East early in the 21st century. At the same time, however, there were some new question 
marks as liberal democracy receded in Russia. The fact remains that by 

the early-21st century, democracy was more
 widespread than ever before in world history.  What factors supported it? Key holdouts, such 

as China and much of the Middle East, also raise questions: Why did 

they stand apart? Was their resist
ance likely to change? Would some 
form of democracy (not necessarily exactly the Western model) prove 

the norm for governments in this most
 recent period of world history? 
 Outline I. This lecture focuses on political change in the contemporary period and, 
more specifically, on the various surges and setbacks of political 

democracy. 
A. We will begin with a definition of democracy as a system that gives the 
majority of people opportunities to
 vote for political candidates and  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
45political parties. Also part of democracy are opportunities for 
reasonable freedom of expression 
and for different candidates and 
different parties to compete in elections. 
B. In the 20
th and 21st centuries, the United States has periodically been a sponsor of democracy in other parts of the world. 
II. By the early-21
st century, almost no part of the world had the same system 
of government as it had a century before. 
A. The dominant political forms of the early-20
th century were empires 
and monarchies.  
B. Empires fell because they could not
 sustain themselves against the 
rising tide of nationalism and demands for independence; this was the 
fate of the European colonial empires, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman 

Empire, and later, elements of the Russian Empire. 
C. Monarchies fell and were replaced 
with republics because they were not supple enough to fit modern circumstances. In some instances, 

monarchies fell victim to their association with aristocratic and 

agricultural social systems.  
III. No uniform pattern of response em
erged to political change in the contemporary period.  
A. Fascist totalitarian regimes emerged in the 1920sŒ1930s.  
1. Fascism appealed in societie
s that faced significant national frustration, defeat in war, or appetites for more territory.  
2. Fascism emerged where there were pronounced social divisions, 
often serving as a popular cover for upper-class domination. 
3. Fascism served as a vehicle fo
r leadership ambitions and for 
efforts to use propaganda and intimidation to link peoples with this 
new principle of leadership. B. Totalitarianism involved government
s that sought to control most 
aspects of society and to eliminate all vigorous forms of political 

opposition.  1. Communist totalitarian options emerged in societies that were 
seized by communist revolutions or conquered by communist 
regimes.  
2. Communism is not the same as fascism or totalitarianism, but it 
coincided with fascism in its emphasis on strong central 

government control, efforts to appeal to popular support, and 
insistence on active popular loyalty. 
C. In an updated version of authoritarian
ism, leaders, political parties, or 
military forces seize control of a society and seek to eliminate political 
opposition. They do not, however, construct quite such a powerful 
central government apparatus as fascism or communism.

46 1. Authoritarianism surfaced in count
ries where social divisions ran deep, and agreement on any single political or social system 
without imposing authoritarian controls was difficult.  
2. Such controls also surfaced in so
me societies that were eager to 
modernize but mistrustful of other mechanisms for doing so. 
IV. Contemporary world history began with World War I. The aftermath of 
World War I initially seemed somewhat encouraging to possibilities for the 

spread of democracy to areas of the world beyond its then-current home in 

Western society. 
A. The Mexican revolution flirted with democratic systems and installed 
universal suffrage but fairly quickly turned to a reduction of political competition in favor of one-party rule. 
B. Democracy was established in Germany and Italy for the first time and 
in most of the new regimes of East-Central Europe. 
1. Most of these regimes were in
capable of sustaining democracy, 
given the inexperience of their c
itizenry with democratic forms 
and the social divisions within these regions. 
2. In East-Central Europe, for example, sharp divisions existed 
between landlords and peasants, such that landlords supported 
authoritarian alternatives as a means to inhibit social unrest. 
3. The only durable democracy to 
emerge from this East-Central 
European zone in the interwar period was that of Czechoslovakia.  
C. Democratic systems were briefly installed in Japan in the early 1920s, 
but these too quickly fell victim to more authoritarian leadership and 

the demands of military authorities.  
D. The surge of democracy suggested th
at the success of this system in 
some parts of the West provided a logical model for many new 
regimes. Nonetheless, the interwar period is not dominated by the 
durable spread of democracy.  
E. Democracy even faltered in its home base of Western Europe, where 
the erosion of centralist parties, increasing social conflicts, and 

divisions over responses to fascist and communist threats paralyzed 

many democracies. 
V. The aftermath of the Second World War ushered in a more durable 
expansion of democracy beyond its previous concentration in North 

America and Western Europe. 
A. Noteworthy was the establishment 
of democracy in Western Germany 
and Italy under Allied occupation and in Japan. Soon after World War 
II, a democratic government was established in India, newly 
independent from the British. 
B. In the decades immediately after 
World War II, new nations™ issuesŠ
lack of experienced leadership, lack of citizen experience with  ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
47democracy, disputes over boundaries, disputes over social systems, and 
internal social strifeŠtended to yield fairly quick replacement of initial 
democratic experiments with 
authoritarian leadership.  VI. Beginning in the 1970s, a new current can be discerned that seems to lead 
fairly directly to the present-day pattern of an unusually extensive hold of 

democratic systems in the world at large.  
A. The 1970s saw the establishment of democratic systems in the southern 
fringes of Europe, Spain, Portugal, and Greece, where monarchies 
and/or authoritarian systems had previously flourished. 
B. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, virtually every Latin American 
country except Cuba would embrace democratic systems. 
C. The 1980s saw democracies installed 
in a number of places in East and 
Southeast Asia, usually on the heels of popular agitation.  
D. Democratic systems also began to develop from the mid-1980s to the 
early 1990s in most parts of what had been the former Soviet Empire.  

1. Gorbachev™s decision in 1985 to open Russia to new levels of 
political discussion and competition led in the direction of a 
multiparty democratic system.  
2. The dismantling of the Soviet Empire resulted in a number of 
democratic installations in almost all former Soviet or Soviet-

dominated territory in East-Central Europe and in some other parts 

of the former Soviet Empire. 
E. The 1990s saw the expansion of democracy in many parts of sub-
Saharan Africa. Crucial here were the establishment of democracy in 

Nigeria and the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a 

successful political system in South Africa.  
F. Early in the 21
st century, additional democracies were established in 
such places as Ukraine, Georgia, and Indonesia. VII.  The causes for this spread are fairly easy to determine.  
A. The spread of democracy was enc
ouraged by the Western powers and, 
to some degree, Japan and India.  
1. The Western powers™ interest 
in spreading democracy stemmed 
partly from Cold War competitions and partly from a genuine 
commitment to democracy as the preferred political form.  
2. The spread of democracy in Latin America in the late 1970s owed 
a good bit to U.S. foreign policy under President Carter.  
3. By the 1970s and 1980s, the West was sufficiently out of the game 
of defending imperialism that societies could emulate its model 

without the sense that they were caving in to imperialist control. 
B. Democratic political systems also spr
ead because of the wide belief in a direct association between democracy and economic prosperity.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
48 1. Many Latin American systems c
onverted because of a belief that democracy would bring an added commitment to freer enterprise 
and a dismantling of former state interventions in the economy. 
2. Gorbachev™s opening of the Russian political system was directly 
tied to his deep commitment to economic reform.  
3. By the late 1980s, the failure of
 the Marxist political alternative meant that people interested in political change had a smaller set of 

options available to them. 
VIII. The democratic surge has still not taken hold in key parts of the world. 
A. China™s decision in 1978 to introduce market reforms was 
accompanied by an equally clear asser
tion that the authoritarian aspect of communist political 
rule would not budge. B. The Middle East is another region in which democracy remains the 
exception rather than the rule, although there are a few stirrings in the 

early-21st century, partly under American encouragement.  
1. Israel, at least for Israeli citizens, is a democratic beacon.  
2. By the late-20
th century, Turkey was fairly firmly established in 
the camp of durable democratic countries. 
3. Much of the Middle East, however
, remains anchored in one-party 
systems, authoritarian rule, and monarchy. 
C. China and many parts of the Middle East raise issues concerning the 
interaction between older traditions and more recent developments.  
1. China offers an interesting combination of an undemocratic 
Confucian tradition and a relatively recent revolution whose aftermath may still be inhibiting the growth of democracy. 
2. We see a similar case in the Middl
e East, with the combination of 
Islamic traditions and the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early-
20th century, and the formation of a new group of nations. 
IX.
 The other main issue in the spr
ead of democracy in the late-20
th century and early 21st involves durability. A. By the early 21
st century, authoritarian impulses seemed to be gaining 
ascendancy among Russian leadership. 
B. In a few Latin American instances, questions arose about whether 
societies that have not previously sustained long periods of democratic 
rule would be able to do so now.  
C. Other factors might encourage 
greater optimism for democracy.  
 1. As the use of computers pro
liferated, for example, experts 
wondered whether this technological underpinning might see 

democracy spread still further.  
D. Political change has been a key feature of the contemporary period and 
has yielded an unprecedented interest in democratic political forms. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
49The contemporary period, however, has produced a variety of political 
impulses. 
1. The early-21
st century saw a wave of socialist victories in Latin 
American elections.  
2. The same thing may occur as demo
cracies spread to other parts of the world, particularly the Middle East.  
3. The spread of democracy does not
 necessarily erase the need to pay ongoing attention to global political complexity.

50 Lecture Thirty-Four 
 Contemporary Cultural Change 
 Scope: Many people changed or significantly adapted their belief systems in 
the 20
th century. In this sense, the contemporary period can be 
compared to the postclassical period, 
the last era of fairly systematic 
cultural change. There were also connections between cultural and 
political change.  Several factors pushed for cultural change: new 
levels of contact among societies (including the impact of returning 

immigrants), rapid urbanization, and active ﬁmissionaryﬂ activity by 

leaders eager to convey new political attachments or simply to sell 
consumer goods. It is also clear that directions of change were complex 

and a great deal of resistance developed, particularly from the 1970s 
onward. Even more than change, then, cultural contest both among and 
within societies describes the contemporary period to date. Three 
ideologies gained ground, particularly during the first three quarters of 
the 20
th century and often at the expense of traditional religious beliefs: 
nationalism, Marxism, and liberal humanitarianism. These three belief 

systems were quite different, often opposed in principle though open to 

combination in practice. They also shared key features: they were 

secular, they pointed to progress on this Earth, and they usually urged a 

new level of faith in science. But there were other cultural claimants as 

well, particularly among religions. In Africa, for example, the spread of 

Christianity and Islam defined the most important cultural changes, 

though consumerism and nationalism also spread to a degree. Latin 

America saw a variety of new relig
ious enthusiasms, most recently, 

Protestant evangelicalism. More important still, the rise of religious 
fundamentalisms from the 1970s onward added tremendous complexity 
to the world™s cultural map, dividing loyalties within such regions as 

India, the United States, and the Middle East and sometimes dividing 

loyalties within families or individuals.  
 Outline I. The contemporary period has seen massive cultural change in most parts of 
the world. In this sense, it might be compared to the postclassical period. 
A. If we look at the dominant cultural systems of most parts of the world 
around 1900, we see the continued hold of the world religions. If we 
fast-forward to a century later, the hold of the religions has been 

qualified, and the cultural map quite has become more complex.  
B. Although there was no global agr
eement on a new political system, 
there was wide agreement that the old systems no longer worked. The 
same is not true for culture. In this arena, we see significant cultural 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
51contestation and competition with
in and among regions and even 
within individuals. 
C. There are several reasons to see 
the contemporary period in terms of 
cultural change, including new migration patterns, massive 
urbanization, and active ﬁmissionaryﬂ efforts for one or more new 

kinds of beliefs. In addition, each of the revolutions of the contemporary period attacked older cultural systems in favor of new 

commitments. 
II. Three main competitors emerged for cultural allegiance in the 
contemporary period, none of which was entirely new. 
A. The first entrant was nationalism. As we saw earlier, nationalism 
praised tradition to some extent and could combine with older belief 
systems. Nationalism, however, tended to move people at least partially 

away from older religious formulations. 
1. Indian nationalism urged Indians to retain their older commitments 
to Hinduism or Islam but to modify these with new views about 
social castes and class, gender, and politics. 
2. African nationalists attacked older polytheistic religious loyalties 
and introduced important social and political divisions. 
B. The most systematic competitor for cultural allegiance in the 20
th century was Marxism, which has some elements of religion. 
1. Marxism argues that religion is
 explicitly wrong and that people should free themselves of it in preparation for the revolution.  
2. Marxism urges attention to scientific principles of history and to 
science itself, along with a commitment to materialism and the 
material forces that drive 
the historical process.  
3. Marxism urges commitment to principles of social equality and to 
new political formulations. 
4. In the hands of leaders in the 20
th century, Marxism produced not 
only beliefs but also martyrs, symbols, and rituals deliberately 

designed to compete with older religious forms. 
C. The third competitor for belief in the contemporary period has been 
called by anthropologists 
liberal humanitarianism
. This belief system 
emphasizes three principal identities or commitments. 
1. The first of these is consumerism, a cultural system in which 
people gain part of their satisfac
tion and part of their personal and 
group identities from the process of consuming goods that they do 
not necessarily need. 2. Liberal humanitarianism involves a substantial commitment to 
science as a means of explaining the world around us and as the 

potential solution for many social and individual ills. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
52 3. Liberal humanitarianism involves a considerable degree of 
tolerance and cosmopolitanism, as well as a sense that other people 
and cultures offer opportunities for learning. D. In challenging traditional beliefs, these three systems frequently 
challenged each other.  1. Marx and Marxists leaders described nationalism as another 
cultural component that could mislead the working classes.  
2. Nationalists were frequently hostile to consumerism as an 
individualistic form of expression 
E. Despite their differences, these 
systems also combined with one 
another and with older cultural valu
es: for example, many Japanese 
consumerists, living in a society 
that was increasingly secular, continued to use some Buddhist rituals, and male Italian Marxists often 
had their children baptizedŠjust in case. III. These three belief systems sh
ared some points in common. 
A. The three systems were secular. They all judged society and 
individuals in terms of activities in this world.  
B. The three systems were also, broadly speaking, progressive; they 
believed that society, over time, would become better if the national 

state gained ground, as the communist revolution took hold, or as 

standards of living rose.  
C. These belief systems tended to emphasize the goal of the individual to 
find greater satisfaction in this lif
e rather than in the afterlife. 
D. These systems had some commitment to science.  
1. Marx prided himself on the scientific qualities of his theories.  
2. Most nationalists urged attention to science to increase national 

strength. 
IV. These cultural packages challenged the primary cultural identifiers of the 
world in 1900, but they have not yet dislodged older beliefs as clearly as 

new political systems dislodged 
their older counterparts. A. These cultural packages do not fit some key regions, most notably, sub-
Saharan Africa. 1. This region has been the scene of
 massive cultural change in the 
contemporary period, with elements of Marxism, nationalism, and 
liberal humanitarianism. 
2. But the big cultural story in 20
th-century sub-Saharan Africa has 
been the massive gains of Islam and Christianity among the 

populace.  B. Latin America has also seen some interest in nationalism, Marxism, 
and liberal humanitarianism, but much of the cultural story of Latin 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
53America in the past half century ha
s been the increasing interest in 
Protestant fundamentalism. 
C. In the wake of the fall of Marxism in Eastern Europe and the reduction 
of Marxist cultural enthusiasm, people are once again open to new 
religious influences in both Russia and China.  
V. A significant issue relating to these cultural belief systems involves the rise 
of religious fundamentalism, not only in Islam, but also in Western 

Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, and Buddhism.  
A. Religious fundamentalism urges the transcendent importance of 
religious commitments and a religious cultural framework over the new 
forces of nationalism, Marxism, or liberal humanitarianism. 
B. Religious fundamentalists urge a return to an established body of 
religious truth, often involving stri
ct moral codes and rearrangements 
of gender relationships. 
C. Religious fundamentalism typically involves innovation; 
fundamentalists are adept at using technological devices to spread their 

message and win adherence.  
D. Many religions, under the spur of fundamentalism, become more 
intolerant than they had been traditionally. 
E. Many fundamentalists insist increasingly on the importance of gaining 
state support for their religious goals and beliefs.  
F. The rise of fundamentalism indicat
es a definite reaction to secular cultural alternatives and a reaction to the somewhat more tolerant 

approaches within a religion itself; it further suggests innovation, 

particularly in political policy and the uses of technology. G. Why is fundamentalism gaining ground?  
1. Fundamentalism is a reassertion of real or imagined traditional 
identity against the cosmopolitan features of new cultural systems. 
2. Religious revivals reflect the fact that many of the new cultural 
systems fail to provide spiritual satisfaction.  
3. Religious fundamentalism has frequently appealed to social groups 
who find themselves left out of the benefits, real or imagined, of 

the modern world.  
4. The cultural collapse of Marx
ism may also be a factor. 
VI. What are the results of these ch
anges in cultural belief systems? 
A. One result is a certain degree of regional division.  
 1. A few regions, such as Western 
Europe, seem largely content to 
remain secular; their cultural cha
nge has reached a fairly uniform 
conclusion.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
54 B. Most parts of the world, however, have seen internal divisions and 
conflict among groups within the region.  
 1. We see such conflict between secular loyalties and leadership and 
religious enthusiasms in the Middle East, the United States, Latin 
America, and to some degree Africa. 
C. We do not know the end of the story of cultural change; we can, 
however, note the complexity that cultural divisions within and among 

regions add to the story of global politics and the future of world 
history

55Lecture Thirty-Five 
 Gender in Contemporary World History 
 Scope: The contemporary period of world history is a crucial point of change 
in gender relations and conditions fo
r women. In turn, gender issues 
form part of the definition of this period after many centuries in which 
no fundamental developments occurred in this arena at a global level. 

At the same time, questions must be raised about the uniformity and 

extent of change, which makes gender history a complex part of the 

contemporary global mosaic. Though there were differences in timing 

and extent, widespread changes occurred in women™s educational 

access and in key political and legal rights. Many of these 
developments were supported by international nongovernmental 

organizations and, after 1945, by the United Nations. Changes in work 

roles occurred, but there was great variety here, depending on region 
and location. Widespread reductions in birthrates also affected gender 
relations. At the same time, many 
formal and informal forces were 
eager to maintain more traditional gender roles.  
 Outline I. Gender relations constitute one of the important themes in the 
contemporary period. Examining gender relations also allows us to measure 

developments in this period against previous developments and raise some 

analytical issues. II. We will begin with some background to
 our discussion of gender issues.  A. Patriarchal gender relations were characteristic of agricultural 
economies. We also saw that the 
classical civilizations enshrined patriarchal relationships in
 codes of law and conduct. 
B. In the postclassical period, two contradictory trends emerged that 
constituted the next reshaping of gender relationships.  
 1. The spread of world religions established a degree of spiritual 
equality between men and women and began to attack certain 

traditional practices, such as female infanticide.  
 2. Some trends were established that could worsen women™s 
conditions, such as the practice of foot-binding in China.  
C. Neither the early modern period nor the Long 19
th Century introduced 
systematic global changes in ge
nder relations, although there were 
specific social and regional developments.  
D. The contemporary period ushered in some developments that clearly 
erode traditional patriarchy, although they do not necessarily establish true equality. This period of world history will probably be regarded as 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
56 one in which many traditional gende
r assumptions were rethought and 
traditional relationships reconstituted. 
III. A number of factors pushed for change in the contemporary period.  
A. Most of the revolutions of the 20
th century, in contrast to the Atlantic 
revolutions, did not have real gender impact, although most of these 
revolutions heralded their implications for gender relations.  
1. Except in Iran, women found in the revolutionary regimes new 
opportunities for public roles; principles of legal equality were also established. 
2. The fact of rhetorical cha
nge itself and the changes in 
opportunities for women were signi
ficant. Nationalist movements 
often used women actively then shunted them aside, but the 
process of galvanizing women to voice their concerns helped to 
accelerate change.  B. World economic relationships also had an impact on gender.  
 1. Changes in production processe
s provided new opportunities for womenŠfor example, in certain kinds of factoriesŠbut they also 

produced new competition for women™s work.  
C. Larger processes, such as urba
nization and the reduction of infant 
mortality, had an impact on women. 
D. Increasingly important from the 1950s onward were the operations of 
governmental and nongovernmental international agencies. By the late-

19th century, a number of international feminist movements had formed 
that pressed a women™s rights agenda on governments and international 

agencies around the world. 
1. The U.N. Charter Statements of Rights conventionally included 
gender issues and provided a framewo
rk for pressure in individual 
societies toward changing gender 
laws and gender relationships 
more widely.  
2. In 1965, the United Nations began to sponsor a ﬁYear of the 
Womanﬂ every decade or even a ﬁDecade of the Woman.ﬂ  
3. The U.N. conferences also spawned local nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) to work on women™s right issues and report 
on these issues to larger groups such as Amnesty International. 
IV. During the 20
th and early-21st centuries, change took certain clear 
directions. 
A. Beginning a little before World War I in Scandinavia and after the war 
in the United States, the Soviet Union, Germany, Turkey, and other 
European countries, voting rights for women were established. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
57B. Other legal rights were attached to
 this basic conversion in suffrage 
systems, including divorce and property rights. 
C. In education, women gained ground during the 20
th and, to date, the 
21st centuries. By the early-21st century, in an impressive variety of 
societies, women began to gain majority ascendancy even in higher 
education. Parity in education could be expected to translate into 

greater job opportunities and political voice. D. Voting rights, legal rights, and e
ducational change propelled increasing 
female representation in elected legi
slatures. Gains have been made in 
this area in the United States, Europe
, South Asia, China, and Russia.  
E. Women also gained a new measure of equality in consumerism, 
participating in opportunities to buy things as a means of self-
expression.  
V. These changes applied to almost every region of the world and brought an 
end to literal patriarchal systems.  
A. Feminists still use the term ﬁpatriarchyﬂ as a means of pointing out 
inequalities, but from a historical 
standpoint, developments in the 20
th century suggest the beginning of the end of patriarchal systems that had 
predominated through the long agricultural period of world history.  
B. Not all the systems work the way they are supposed to.  
 1. In rural India, for example, women have the right to vote, but 
fathers or husbands check to ma
ke sure they vote ﬁcorrectly.ﬂ VI. In gender relations, as in so many aspects of contemporary world history, 
we can point to patterns of change, 
new issues, and new causes, but we do 
not know the end of the story. We can also highlight intriguing 

complexities.  
A. Some regions have more smoothly a
dopted gender change than others.  
 1. Regions that have experienced revolution, such as China, see far 
less debate about new roles for women than do regions where 
change has been more incrementa
l, such as rural India or the Middle East. 
B. By the end of the 20
th century, every major region in the world was 
participating in a slowing of the birthrate. Some regions had achieved 

what™s known as the demographic transition,
 in which the average woman has a small number of children, almost all of whom live.  
1. Western Europe and the United States experienced demographic 
transitions by the end of the 19
th century or the early-20th, while 
Japan and the Soviet Union did so either between the World Wars 
or right after World War II.  
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
58 2. Latin America experienced its 
demographic transition in the 
1970s.  3. Sub-Saharan Africa and some Islamic regions have yet to 
experience a demographic transition, even though their birthrates 
have begun to drop.  
4. We do not know for sure whether succeeding decades will 
demonstrate that this is anothe
r area where women™s conditions are 
changing in similar directions.  
5. This tendency to reduce the birthrate will inevitably have 
additional implications for women™s lives and their relationships 

with men in the future. 
C. Along with new rights and increased
 access to education have come 
new opportunities for or new demands on women to participate in the 

labor force outside the home.  
1. Communist societies usually insisted on substantial levels of work 
for women, although women might be paid less than men and have 
limited opportunities in certain occupations.  
2. In Western Europe and the United States, women™s work 
commitments gained ground systematically only from the later 

1950s onward. Japan entered this picture a little later and seems to 

be moving in a similar direction.  
3. Some of the more exploited areas of the world economy seemed to 
discourage women™s work participati
on: in Africa, for example, as 
peripheral-type jobs expanded, me
n tended to seize them and leave 
the women responsible for agriculture. 
4. Similar developments occurred with the fall of communism and 
Marxism in much of Eastern Europe: with the loss of Marxism™s 
support for gender equality and with increasing economic turmoil, 
many women found their ec
onomic positions eroding. 
D. Individual men and groups of men in many societies have found ways 
to retaliate against women for the gains they have achieved. 
1. It is likely that violence ag
ainst women has increased in 
contemporary world history, with men using direct attacks on 
women as a way to express their 
frustration and as a reaction to 
pressures urging revisions of traditional gender relationships. 
2. It is also possible that rape and violence against women have 
increased as instruments of war. 
3. Sometimes the ﬁpushbackﬂ of men may take legal form as in the 
revival of customary legal codes.  
VII.  Western feminists and ot
her advocates, until recently, have usually agreed on a human rights agenda for women, but some are now arguing that the 

Western version of feminism is not what they want. 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
59A. Some Indian women, for example, have written that they do not want 
to see arranged marriages replaced 
with Western marriage patterns.  
 1. Arranged marriages are seen as better for women and more likely 
to be stable and put less pressure on women to beautify themselves 
for men. 
B. Many Middle Eastern women may wish to revise Islam to some extent 
but without adopting a Western version of women™s rights.  
 1. In Egypt and elsewhere, veiling is seen by some women as an 
important expression of their ability to make individual choices 
and a gesture of defiance against undue international influences. 
C. Some African feminists have argued that the Western international 
women™s rights package is too individualistic and that Africa has its 
own traditions of collective and family protection for women. 
D. These complex gender issues remain a fundamental part of the shaping 
of the contemporary period in world history.

out? Is it possible to define the system that will replace it?

60 Lecture Thirty-Six 
 Globalization and World History 
 Scope: The idea of globalization became a 
hot theory in Western social 
science circles in the 1990s. Much discussion focused on whether the 
process was a good thing or not, with fairly extreme positions taken on 
both sides. The general sense, however, was that globalization was 

producing a very different world from periods
 past; a group calling themselves new global historians has amplified this claim. Figuring out 

how dramatic globalization is raises some challenging issues. 

Assessment is further complicated by
 resistance to globalization. Two 
or three historical models are worth considering. In addition, different 

aspects of globalization can be assessed, breaking down what is 

sometimes presented as a single pack
age. The subject is sweeping and can seem rather abstract, but it 
relates to some very specific 
developments. For example, the United Arab Emirates ban on using 

young boys as riders in camel races
 in 2004 influenced the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that minors should not be subject to the death 

penalty, after years in which the United States and Somalia had been 

the only countries to resist an international convention on this subject. 

Why the long holdout and why the change? Globalization touches a 

wide variety of policies and behaviors and, by definition, a wide 

swathe of geography.    
 Outline I. The most exciting development in social science in the 1990s was the 
concept of globalization
, which focuses on the intensification of contacts 
among societies in the world to the extent of affecting basic frameworks of 

life.  A. A group of 
new global historians
 has adopted the concept, arguing that 
globalization is one of the most fundamental changes in human history. 
B. Globalization gives us an opportunity to look at the sweep of world 
history in terms of key moments and issues as a means of setting this 
phenomenon in an appropriate historical context. 
C. Globalization also sparks a number of questions. 
II. We will begin by further defining globalization.  
A. Globalization depends on rapid technol
ogical changes, particularly in 
communication and transportation. New connective technologies form 

a basic part of the definition of the 20
th century as a new period in world history. 
B. Globalization also involves a wide range of activity.

61 1. In 2004, the United Arab Emirates banned the use of boy jockeys 
in camel races because leaders r
ealized that world opinion would disapprove of this use of children.  
 2. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that children could not 
be put to death for crimes, speci
fically citing the importance of 
world opinion in setting standards for the nation. 
C. Globalization represents a certain optimism for the future, although this 
idea can be taken to extremes.  
III. Throughout this course, we have seen a recurrent tension between human 
interest in forming local and regional societies with established identities 
and the advantages or inescapability of contacts with other societies. This 

tension has been progressively redefi
ned throughout history; in one way, 
globalization is simply the latest iteration of this redefinition. 
A. Even at the time of agriculture 
and early civilizations, aspects of globalization were already emerging.  
 1. People began migrating early, and migration is still a key feature 
of globalization, although now it can take place more quickly and 
over longer distances and it involves the possibility of return. B. The spread of disease, another key aspect of globalization, also has 
early roots that have changed with globalization. The globalization 
phenomenon allows disease to spread more rapidly but also has 

spawned such institutions as the World Health Organization. 
IV. In the early stages of the human e
xperience, contacts formed a vital but 
subordinate theme; the attention of leaders and ordinary people alike was 

devoted to the formation of local and regional societies, clusters of 

institutions, and clusters of cultural identities.  
A. In the classical period we saw a sy
stem of contacts that connected the 
various classical societies from China to Rome along such routes as the 
great Silk Road. We also noted, howev
er, that at this point, the balance between regional focus and interregional contact was still slanted in 

favor of the regional.  
B. With the postclassical period, we saw the balance shift decisively. 
Some world historians would argue that what we now call 

globalization actually began around 1000 CE. 
1. During this era, trade among various regions in Afro-Eurasia 
routinely and fundamentally connected various societies. 
2. From about 1000 CE onward, many world historians see an 
intensification of this basic framework, rooted in trade, that would 
make contacts and convergences s
uperior to regional identities. C. With the addition of the Americas 
and Oceania to the list of societies involved in global contacts and with the intensification of trade and 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
62 biological connections, the early modern period is another chapter in 
this ongoing intensification.  
V. With the postclassical era, some world historians would argue that the 
framework for globalization was already established. In discussing the 

phenomenon today, we need only note 
subsequent intensification in 
patterns of interaction and dependence on contact. Alternatives to this view, 

however, argue for greater change in the last one or two centuries. 
A. Many historians now argue that the process of globalization, as distinct 
from earlier patterns of contact, began in the Long 19
th Century. In this 
period, we see new technology and ot
her developments that helped link 
societies more rapidly than before and intensified international trade.  
B. In the Long 19
th Century, we also see the first signs of what we now 
call cultural globalization.  
 1. At the end of the 19
th century, for example, international interest in 
sports emerged, which would be a key element of international 
culture from that point onward. 
C. In the Long 19
th Century, we see the early phases of political 
globalization with, for example, agreements relating to international 

mail and the treatment of prisoners of war.  
VI. The 20
th century raises several issues in connection with globalization. 
A. In the second quarter of the 20
th century, a number of societies 
deliberately pulled away from globa
lization. This reaction against 
globalization, which was not yet seen as acceptable, strengthens the argument that this phenomenon began in the late-19
th century.  B. By the second half of the 20
th century, new organizational capacity, 
particularly in the form of multinational corporations, offered a way to 

measure 20
th-century globalization as a partially new phenomenon. 
C.  Also in the 20
th century, environmental change and anti-globalization 
protests were added to the picture.  
1. In the 19
th century and earlier, human activities mainly had 
regional environmental consequences; in the later-20
th century, people realized that activities in one region can have an 
environmental impact on distant regions. 
2. The first explicit protests against globalization began in 1999. This 
was a sign that globalization had become sufficiently defined as a 

force against which groups with particular interests could unite. 
VII.  The 20th and 21st centuries can be seen as different from the Long 19
th Century in the extent of technological change and the implications of 

various aspects of global contact. These two themes may finally convince 
 ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
63people that the 20
th and 21st centuries embody the crucial measures of 
globalization.  
A. Globalization almost inevitably must be viewed in the larger lens of 
world history, forcing us to look back to previous types of contact and 
previous concerns about contact. This broader vision enables us to see 

what is new and recapitulative about the globalization process.  B. The broad view is crucial in assessing the quality of globalization. Do 
economic advantages outweigh the co
sts to specific cultural identities? 
Do economic advantages spread widely or uniformly enough? These 

questions take on new meaning with the world historical view.  
C. World history also contributes greater understanding of the extent to 
which different societies, because of their prior historical experience and cultural and institutional contexts, respond differently to common 
forces of change, including globalization.  
D. Globalization is a process that r
ouses resistance and accommodation. In 
the Middle East, Europe, and the Un
ited States, we see a significant 
accommodation to globalization, but 
we also see concerns about religion, migration, and issues of political sovereignty in relation to 

globalization.  
VIII. Just as world history provides a perspective on globalization, so, too, does 
globalization provide an opportunity to renew our sense of why the world 

history enterprise is a significant one.  
A. There are many good reasons to be interested in history, among them, 
the opportunity to see how the past shapes the present. Given that our 
present is inescapably a global one, world history is a crucial 

framework for understanding our own times.  
B. Contacts are not a new phenomenon, nor is resistance to contact; in the 
19th century and, perhaps, again in the later-20th century, however, this basic tension between the regional and the global changed crucially. 

World history helps us make that determination. 
C. World history is also essential in helping us to determine why different 
societies react to globalization in different ways and in helping us sort out the impact of globalization on our own society and others.   
IX.
 In these lectures, we have argued that since about 3500 BCE, the concept of 
civilization is one of the key mechanisms by which we can make sense of 
the variety of experiences that constitute world history.  
A. We have also argued that civilization is a form of human organization, 
but that as individual civilizations developed, they formed identities 
and characteristics that would mark them off, in part, from other 

societies.   ©2007 The Teaching Company. 
64 B. By the 21
st century, under the impact of 
globalization, are we reaching a point at which civilization itselfŠas an expression of identityŠwill 
begin to yield ground to other, more global forms of identity?  
 1. If the answer to this question is yes, we would seem to be in an era 
that is experiencing a fundamental shift away from some of the 

common currency that world history has maintained for more than 

5,000 years.  
C. Some historians argue that civilization will trump globalization, and we 
will see a clash of civilizations focused particularly on tensions 
between Islam and the West. 
D. We do not know the future, but we do know that we cannot even 
formulate sensible questions or 
examine possibilities without knowing 
the history that lies at their base.  
E. World history is a vital tool to help us sort out what shapes our present 
and what will shape our future.
