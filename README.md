# Rewrite History


## Intro
In this project I will use RNN to read 7 different history books and create a new one.

# The books I used were randomly chosen from a free website and they are:

* The Decisive Battles of World History  
* A Brief History of the World  
* AMERICA- a narrative history  
* A short history of the united states  
* Atlas-of-world-history  
* Secret_History  
* The Oxford History Of The Classical World  
  
   
   
The convert.py file will convert pdf files to txt files, while the Rewrite.py	file will create the text.
